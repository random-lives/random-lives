Hind was born on December 23, 1201, in a farming village on the Nile Delta under Ayyubid rule, where Arabic-speaking Sunni Muslims worked land held by larger owners and answered to tax collectors. Her father, Hasan, rented a very small plot on shares and took day work when it appeared. Her mother, Zahra, kept the household moving with grinding and baking, hauling water, and spinning flax into thread in the dim part of the room where the spindle stayed clean.

Their first child, Yusuf, had been born in 1190. At eleven he was already sent out with errands, to watch a bundle of fodder, to carry a small sack to a neighbor’s yard. He watched quietly when Zahra washed the newborn and rubbed her with oil. Hasan spoke the call to prayer into Hind’s ear and chose her name. Zahra repeated short du‘a over her and kept her wrapped tight against the winter chill.

Spring brought more people coughing and children marked with rash. In July 1202 the sickness reached their lane. Zahra kept Hind close and fed her often, then sent Yusuf to Umm Yusuf next door for help and for water that had been boiled. Hasan went to Shaykh Salim for recitation and returned with words to speak over the child.

Hind died on August 12, 1202. Hasan washed her small body, wrapped her in cloth, and carried her to burial outside the village. A brief prayer was said, and she was laid into the earth facing Mecca.
