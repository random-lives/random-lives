Tako was born in the warm season in a small riverine band in the inland Atlantic Forest of what is now northern Rio de Janeiro state. No chiefs or councils ruled beyond the band’s elders and the pull of kin ties. His people spoke a local tongue that later vanished, and they dealt with danger and illness through shaman-led rites, smoke, chants, and strict taboos around blood and birth.

His mother, Nari, kept a mother-centered hearth group, with women sleeping close and children from other families drifting in and out. Heno, her partner, followed hunting and trap lines for days at a time and returned with small mammals, birds, and fish taken from the river shallows. Nari spent her days close to camp: gathering palm fruits and tubers, hauling water in gourds, feeding the fire, and rinsing fiber and skins in the stream. Suma, Nari’s mother, stayed near. She boiled water, rubbed the baby with warm hands, and watched the cord stump for swelling.

Tako nursed often at first. After two weeks the stump turned wet and foul-smelling. Nari cleaned it and kept him wrapped against her chest. When he stopped feeding well and cried in short bursts, Suma fetched Oki, the band’s healer. Oki burned resin and dried leaves in a small bowl, blew smoke over the infant, chanted, and painted protective lines with charcoal and clay.

Tako died at one month old. Nari and Suma placed his body in a shallow pit in sandy ground above the river, sprinkled red earth over him, and set a small shell and a pinch of food beside him before covering the grave.
