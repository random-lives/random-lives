## Review Summary for `_lives/0043-ruma.md`

I completed all 14 passes of the review skill on Ruma's story. Here's what was found and fixed:

**Key issues addressed:**

1. **Sibling tracking (Pass 3)**: Nali and Senu disappeared after their initial introduction. Added Nali crying at Ruma's departure and visiting after Henat's death; added Senu helping carry bundles at departure.

2. **Character tracking (Pass 4)**: Haro the trader only appeared once despite being a recurring figure. Added him bringing news during the economic crisis.

3. **Event foreshadowing (Pass 6)**: The Penul conflict jumped from friendly spinning sessions to paranoid accusations with no buildup. Added the scraping stone incident to establish earlier friction.

4. **Paragraph coherence (Pass 7)**: The Kado death paragraph was thin and disconnected. Expanded it to explain his role negotiating with the headman and the resulting power vacuum.

5. **Vague language (Pass 9)**: Changed "older kin" to specifically name "Borul and Sama still living."

6. **Abstract language (Pass 10)**: Changed "anger sharpened into constant edge" to the plain "was angry all the time."

7. **Jargon and naming (Pass 12)**: Removed "patrilocal household" jargon. More significantly, 90% of names were CVCV form (Ruma, Garo, Hena, etc.), violating the <50% guideline. Changed 9 names to varied forms: Garun, Henat, Borul, Ken, Morat, Yorun, Harim, Penul, Darun.

8. **Figurative language (Pass 13)**: Changed "Trade thickened" to "More traders came through."

9. **Final polish (Pass 14)**: Fixed awkward phrasing ("for no reason"), vague references ("The women" → "Eru and the neighbor women"), and passive construction ("brought Ruma the illness" → "Ruma fell sick").
