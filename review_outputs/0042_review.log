✅ Pass 14 complete.

## Review Summary

I completed all 14 passes on `_lives/0042-alo.md`. This is a well-crafted infant story that required only two fixes:

**Issues found:**
- [Pass 6] Major anachronism: The story claimed Han conquest 30 years before 141 BC, but Han actually conquered Nanyue in 111 BC (30 years AFTER Alo's birth). In 141 BC, Nanyue was still an independent kingdom under the Zhao dynasty.
- [Pass 14] "when she was able" was vague about why Mai had limited ability to work

**Changes made:**
- Replaced the incorrect Han conquest context with historically accurate Nanyue kingdom context: founded by Qin general Zhao Tuo ~203 BC after the Qin collapse, court at Panyu mixing Han administrators with local chiefs, bronze drums at Yue festivals
- Changed "when she was able" to "through her pregnancy" to make the context explicit

The story is otherwise solid: household composition is clear, all characters are tracked, the timeline is complete for a 5-day life, there's no AI-slop or figurative language, and the prose is concrete and direct.
