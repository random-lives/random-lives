## Review Summary for `_lives/0040-noma.md`

I completed all 14 passes of the review. Here are the key issues found and fixed:

**Issues found:**
- **Pass 1**: Sena's death timing was ambiguous ("that winter" - unclear which winter)
- **Pass 2**: Household composition wasn't clear; Hani appeared suddenly during recovery without earlier introduction
- **Pass 4**: Luma disappeared after paragraph 4 despite being described as "adoptive father figure"
- **Pass 6**: Ice accident survival mechanism was unclear
- **Pass 9**: "moved in the same rhythms" - AI-slop phrase
- **Pass 12**: Nearly all names (8/9) were CVCV pattern
- **Pass 14**: Senai's description repeated redundantly; "felt her own usefulness vanish" too abstract; "exact reports" sounded clinical

**Changes made:**
- Clarified Sena's death timing to "When Noma was fourteen"
- Added Senai to household description and introduced Hanuk as same-age companion early
- Added Luma testing Noma's leg at age 16 before she returns to hunting
- Expanded ice accident to show rescue (others pulling her out, stripping wet clothes, wrapping in hides)
- Changed "moved in the same rhythms" to "knew where the other would step"
- Varied names: Yali→Yalit, Pira→Pirak, Sena→Senai, Hani→Hanuk (now 4/9 CVCV)
- Rewrote Senai death paragraph to remove repetition, add concrete detail
- Changed "felt her own usefulness vanish" to "knew she was eating what others had gathered"
- Changed "exact reports" to "told them what she had seen"

The story is now cleaner with better character tracking, clearer household composition, more varied naming, and tighter prose.
