I've completed all 14 passes of the review for the story of Nathono (0041). Here's a summary:

## Review Summary

**Passes completed:** All 14

**Key issues found and fixed:**

1. **Timeline** - Added bridging paragraph for the gap between ages 10-16
2. **Household composition** - Fixed historically inappropriate "Kawina's older brother" to "mother's younger brother" for matrilineal context; specified vague "dependents" 
3. **Sibling introduction** - Added Nankula to childhood so he doesn't appear suddenly in adulthood
4. **Character tracking** - Added Nakhulo's appearance between birth and adulthood; introduced Kawunza earlier
5. **Event mechanism** - Specified who beat Nathono (Sarima's brothers)
6. **Paragraph coherence** - Split overly long paragraphs, separated depression from affair
7. **Chronology** - Removed redundant time markers, varied "In [year]" openers
8. **Vague language** - Replaced "slow and heavy" with concrete timeframe
9. **Figurative language** - Removed simile about cleaning, metaphor about shadow
10. **Flow** - Added ending to affair section, merged short paragraphs

The story is now more coherent with better character tracking, historically appropriate household composition, varied time markers, and cleaner prose.
