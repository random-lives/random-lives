Review complete. Here's a summary of the 14 passes:

**Passes with no issues:** 1 (Timeline), 2 (Household), 3 (Siblings), 4 (Characters), 5 (Deaths), 6 (Events), 7 (Paragraphs), 8 (Chronology), 10 (Abstract Claims), 11 (Anachronisms), 13 (AI-Slop)

**Passes with fixes made:**
- **Pass 9** (Vague Language): Changed "small loads" to "vegetables or charcoal"
- **Pass 12** (Jargon): Replaced "nuclear household" with plain description
- **Pass 14** (Final Read): Improved awkward phrasing, added developmental moment showing Baozi alive

The story was already quite solid - it's a short infant life with clear family structure, appropriate historical grounding for 1840s Yunnan, and authentic Chinese folk practices. The main improvement was adding a brief moment of Baozi being a living baby (sitting up, watching chickens, reaching for incense smoke) before the illness and death, which makes the loss more poignant and the story less procedural.
