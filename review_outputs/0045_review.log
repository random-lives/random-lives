I've completed all 14 passes on the story. Here's a summary of the review:

## Review Summary for `_lives/0045-kālī.md`

**Story:** Kālī, a peasant girl in 8th century Upper Gangetic Plains (754-770 AD)

**Issues found and fixed:**

1. **Pass 1 (Timeline):** Added content for ages 8-13 to bridge gap between grandfather's and grandmother's deaths

2. **Pass 4 (Character Tracking):** 
   - Father Devarāja now reappears when sending news of mother's death
   - Soma (from narrative plan) now introduced as peer helping with harvest
   - Haradatta changed to unnamed "village headman" (single appearance didn't warrant a name)

3. **Pass 6 (Event Mechanism):** Clarified that Gopāla prevented Kālī from returning for her mother's funeral rites

4. **Pass 7 (Paragraph Coherence):** Split mother's death and harvest achievement into separate paragraphs

5. **Pass 9 (Vague Language):** Changed abstract "found a space where her energy helped her" to concrete "her talkativeness served her"

6. **Pass 11 (Historical Grounding):** Added specific reference to Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty in opening

7. **Pass 14 (Final Polish):** 
   - Simplified "moved from child's chores to a woman's share of work" 
   - Changed bureaucratic "elder who handled measures and storage norms" to "village headman"

The story was already well-constructed with good concrete detail, appropriate historical grounding, and clear character relationships. The changes were relatively minor refinements to improve flow, specificity, and character tracking.
