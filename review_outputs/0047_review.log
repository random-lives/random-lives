The review is complete. Let me provide a summary of the changes made:

## Review Summary for `_lives/0047-hadu.md` (Hadu)

I completed all 14 passes of the review skill. Here are the key issues found and fixed:

**Timeline & Chronology (Passes 1, 8, 14):**
- Fixed Lami's illness timing from age 50 to age 48 (matching debug data)
- Reordered Tima's death to correct chronological position (age 32, after Kesh's death)
- Added a bridge paragraph covering the gap from late 30s to mid-40s
- Reordered children paragraph to appear before the fight at age 28
- Clarified the marriage flashback with "Marriage had come earlier"
- Fixed Suli's birth from age 19 to age 18 to match debug data
- Added Hadu's age to Suli's death paragraph for clarity

**Event Connections (Pass 6):**
- Added explicit connection between the Shurak feud and Hadu's later relocation

**Paragraph Coherence (Pass 7):**
- Split an overloaded paragraph (relocation + trade + deaths) into two focused paragraphs

**Jargon & Naming (Pass 12):**
- Replaced "affinal ties" with "where Lami had relatives"
- Changed "Sena" → "Senat" and "Vanu" → "Vanu'a" to reduce CVCV name percentage from 56% to 44%

**Flow Improvements (Pass 14):**
- Minor flow improvements to the Rishan/Suli paragraph

The story now has proper chronological flow, better paragraph organization, and clearer connections between events.
