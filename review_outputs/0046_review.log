Review complete. Here's a summary of the changes made to **0046-walwata.md**:

**Issues found across 14 passes:**
- Pass 2: Alliya (paternal aunt) was introduced without identifying her relationship to the family
- Pass 11: Opening could be more specific about the political context (Seha River kingdom, Hittite overlords)
- Pass 14: Several stylistic issues - "brothers filled the yard" felt roster-like, "watching her weight" felt modern, transition between paragraphs 3-4 was abrupt

**Changes made:**
1. Identified Alliya as "Armawi's widowed sister" who lived in the compound
2. Added specific political grounding: "in the lands of the Seha River kingdom that sent tribute to the Hittite overlords at Hattusa"
3. Smoothed the brother introduction: "Four brothers lived there too. The eldest, Tarhuntiya, and Runtiya drove donkeys and loaded goods..."
4. Changed "watching her weight" to the more period-appropriate "checking her limbs for flesh"
5. Improved the ending transition by moving the failure-to-thrive description to end paragraph 3, and starting the final paragraph with "Before her first summer she died"

Overall this was a well-written infant story that needed only minor improvements. The household composition was already clear, the timeline appropriate for an infant's brief life, and the cultural/religious details accurate for Bronze Age Anatolia.
