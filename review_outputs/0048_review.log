I've completed the full 14-pass review of Salma's story. Here's a summary of the review:

## Review Complete: 0048-salma.md

**Key issues found and fixed:**

1. **Timeline gaps** - Added two new paragraphs covering 2008-2013 (children's marriages) and 2014-2020 (younger children's trajectories)

2. **Household clarity** - Clarified that Ghouse's parents had died and brothers lived elsewhere (explaining the nuclear household)

3. **Missing character** - Added Shankar (the Hindu neighbor vendor) who appears twice: lending a tarp early, sharing supplies during COVID

4. **Event details** - Strengthened the domestic violence scene with specific triggers, added details to Imran's infant death, specified Ghouse's illness symptoms

5. **Chronology fix** - Reordered the 1992 section so children born before 1992 are listed first, then the Babri aftermath, then later children

6. **Paragraph coherence** - Separated the communal tension and domestic violence into distinct paragraphs with an economic link

7. **Vague language** - Replaced abstract phrases like "tightened everything" with concrete details like "ate less meat that month and paid rent late"

8. **Historical grounding** - Added context about the Nizam of Hyderabad's rule ending in 1948

9. **Figurative language** - Removed metaphors like "heat sat," "stall became her anchor," "Religious practice sat inside routines"

10. **Character consistency** - Fixed ending where Bibi Jaan (who should have died by 2025 given her age) was replaced with Saba

The story is now more complete, chronologically sound, and reads with better flow and concrete detail.
