# Narrative Review Guide

**Purpose**: Guide for reviewing generated narratives before publication.

## Review Process

Review stories in batches of 10-15. Read each narrative and flag issues in the categories below. Use web search to verify historical/political claims when uncertain.

## What to Look For

### 1. Metaphors and Figurative Language
The style should be plain, direct prose. Flag and rewrite:
- Metaphors and similes
- Poetic or purple prose descriptions
- Personification of abstractions

### 2. AI-Slop Phrases
Flag templated or meaning-making phrases:
- "rhythm of [X]"
- "settled into a pattern"
- "tightened around"
- "would prove to be"
- "little did [X] know"
- "shaped by" / "marked by" / "defined by" (when abstract)
- Abstract summaries like "death had shaped the household" (should be concrete)

### 3. Political/Historical Claims
When a story mentions rulers, political situations, or historical events:
- If vague (e.g., "local rulers"), check if more specificity is possible for that time/place
- Some periods are genuinely murky (e.g., political collapses, contested frontiers) - vagueness is fine there
- Use web search to verify when uncertain

### 4. Repetitive Patterns Across Stories
Watch for the same phrases or structures appearing in multiple stories within a batch. These suggest generation templates leaking through.

### 5. Trait Visibility
For characters with extreme personality traits (below 10th or above 90th percentile) or physical attributes, check that these manifest in concrete actions or descriptions, not just implied.

### 6. Chronicle vs Scene (Long Lives)
Narratives for people who lived 50+ years should dwell on specific moments, not just list events chronologically. Flag if it reads like a timeline rather than a life.

## What NOT to Flag

- Omniscient narrator stating feelings, thoughts, preferences directly ("He liked X", "She hated Y") - this is correct
- Specific dates - these are generated by the system
- Named minor characters (midwives, healers, neighbors)
- Modern geographic terms for reader orientation
- Detailed scenes showing specific moments
