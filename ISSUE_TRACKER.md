# Narrative Review Guide

**Purpose**: Guide for reviewing generated narratives before publication.

## Review Process

Review stories in batches of 10-15. Read each narrative and flag issues in the categories below. Use web search to verify historical/political claims when uncertain.

## What to Look For

### 1. Clarity and Comprehension (HIGH PRIORITY)

The reader should be able to follow the narrative without confusion. Flag:

**Confusing phrasing**
- Sentences that don't parse clearly on first read
- Ambiguous pronouns or references
- Actions where the mechanics are unclear (who did what, how)
- Example: "pressing the baby into the priest's hands and back again" — what is happening?
- Example: "shorter than most women her age would become" — awkward construction

**Missing context**
- Characters appearing without proper introduction
- Relationships not established before they matter (e.g., grandma's closeness to child should be shown before her death scene)
- Birth order unclear when relevant
- Household arrangements not explained (who lives where, why)
- Family members mentioned mid-narrative without earlier establishment (e.g., "His brother Yusuf" appearing without prior mention)

**Logical gaps**
- Unexplained transitions ("The household tried again" — what does this mean?)
- Cause and effect not connected ("apologized afterward" — for what exactly?)
- Events mentioned without showing how they were discovered or resolved
- Random topic shifts within paragraphs (e.g., transitioning from managing household to herb paste preferences without connection)
- Unclear information delivery (e.g., deaths years apart but ambiguous whether news was received separately or together)

**Vague references**
- Phrases like "the settled side" or "service caste duties" that assume reader knowledge
- Social/economic arrangements mentioned but not explained
- Example fix: "service caste duties" → "The household belonged to a weaver caste, and Timma kept a loom"

### 2. Chronology and Time (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Temporal jumps**
- Jumping back and forth in time within paragraphs
- Example: "Between 2009 and 2011... By 2010... At fifteen (2010)" — confusing sequence

**Unnecessary repetition of time markers**
- Starting and ending a paragraph with the same date/month
- Example: "In July of 1005... He died on July 24" — redundant
- Too many year numbers clustered together, making narrative feel chronology-heavy

**Character introductions out of order**
- Mentioning someone in passing before properly introducing them
- Example: "her small son Isidro—born that same year" appearing mid-action scene

### 3. Anachronisms (HIGH PRIORITY)

Flag items that didn't exist in the time/place:
- Foods (chilies in 10th century India — they're from the Americas)
- Technologies
- Political terms or structures
- **Future events/people**: References to events, people, or developments that occurred after the character's death (MAJOR ISSUE - narratives must end at character's death)
- When uncertain, use web search to verify

### 4. Stylistic Issues

**Awkward phrases**
- "ran on energy and then wore down"
- "sex that year, private and practical"

**Paragraphs that don't flow**
- Multiple unrelated topics crammed together
- Second half feels "tacked on" to first half
- Abrupt interludes that break narrative flow (e.g., literacy mentioned mid-childbearing discussion)

**Artificial patterns**
- All names following the same phonetic structure (all CVCV, all two syllables)
- Overly coincidental name pairs (Timma and Timmamma)

### 5. Metaphors and Figurative Language

The style should be plain, direct prose. Flag and rewrite:
- Metaphors and similes
- Poetic or purple prose descriptions
- Personification of abstractions

### 6. AI-Slop Phrases

Flag templated or meaning-making phrases:
- "rhythm of [X]"
- "settled into a pattern"
- "tightened around"
- "would prove to be"
- "little did [X] know"
- "shaped by" / "marked by" / "defined by" (when abstract)
- Abstract summaries like "death had shaped the household" (should be concrete)

### 7. Political/Historical Claims

When a story mentions rulers, political situations, or historical events:
- If vague (e.g., "local rulers"), check if more specificity is possible for that time/place
- Some periods are genuinely murky (e.g., political collapses, contested frontiers) — vagueness is fine there
- Use web search to verify when uncertain

### 8. Repetitive Patterns Across Stories

Watch for the same phrases or structures appearing in multiple stories within a batch. These suggest generation templates leaking through.

**LLM checklist feeling**
- Stories that feel stilted, like the LLM was trying to tick off items from a checklist
- Mechanical inclusion of details without smooth integration into narrative flow

### 9. Trait Visibility

For characters with extreme personality traits (below 10th or above 90th percentile) or physical attributes, check that these manifest in concrete actions or descriptions, not just implied.

### 10. Chronicle vs Scene (Long Lives)

Narratives for people who lived 50+ years should dwell on specific moments, not just list events chronologically. Flag if it reads like a timeline rather than a life.

## What NOT to Flag

- Omniscient narrator stating feelings, thoughts, preferences directly ("He liked X", "She hated Y") — this is correct
- Specific dates — these are generated by the system
- Named minor characters (midwives, healers, neighbors)
- Modern geographic terms for reader orientation
- Detailed scenes showing specific moments
