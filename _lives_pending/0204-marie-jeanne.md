#     death_year: 1738
#     name: Pierre
#     narrative_role: Infant death remembered through family talk and the mother’s anxiety;

#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1742
#     death_age: 11
#     death_year: 1753

#     narrative_role: Younger brother whom Marie Jeanne helps mind and carry; his death
#       (likely fever/accident) becomes her first personal experience of caregiving
#       grief and intensifies her later vigilance.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Household reliability and reputation for competence; also fuels conflict
#       when she criticizes family members and neighbors.
#     scene: She rises before dawn to skim milk and set tasks, then redoes work done
#       ‘sloppily’ by others; keeps a mental inventory of grain, salt, and linen even
#       though she cannot write it down.
#     timing: Most visible from adolescence through widowhood (ages 12-65)
#     trait: Very high Conscientiousness (90th)
#   - consequence: Strong local network that helps during crises; also increases exposure
#       to gossip and social friction.
#     scene: At market and after Mass she speaks readily, negotiates prices, and trades
#       news; she can rally women to help at a birth or during illness.
#     timing: Young adult through midlife (ages 18-55)
#     trait: High Extraversion (83rd)
#   - consequence: Reputation as ‘hard’ or sharp-tongued; strains with husband and later
#       with sons about money and authority.
#     scene: In disputes over field boundaries, gleaning, or the use of a shared oven,
#       she confronts people directly and does not back down; at home she snaps when
#       contradicted.
#     timing: Throughout adulthood, especially under stress (ages 25-60)
#     trait: Low Agreeableness (17th)
#   - consequence: Increased reliance on folk protections and rigid routines; occasional
#       irritability and exhaustion.
#     scene: During pregnancies and wartime, she catastrophizes—checking doors twice,
#       hiding flour, reciting prayers/charms repetitively; sleep is light and interrupted.
#     timing: Peaks during childbearing and Revolution/war (ages 20-60)
#     trait: High Neuroticism (76th)
#   - consequence: Greater vulnerability in transactions and to officials; pushes her
#       to depend on sons/brother for paperwork and negotiations.
#     scene: She cannot read contracts or proclamations; she relies on others to interpret
#       measures, taxes, and church notices, and sometimes misjudges totals or dates.
#     timing: Becomes critical during Revolution and widowhood (ages 49-65)
#     trait: Low Intelligence (17th) / low formal learning
#   - consequence: Helps the household survive lean years, but can worsen neighbor relations
#       if accused of taking advantage.
#     scene: She is comfortable with sharp bargaining and ‘taking what’s fair’ (extra
#       gleaning, a bit more from shared resources) while still seeing herself as moral
#       under God.
#     timing: Adulthood, especially in hardship (ages 30-60)
#     trait: Below-average Honesty-Humility (37th)
# number_of_children: '5'
# number_of_siblings: '5'
# occupation: 'Peasant farmwife: household management + regular farm labor (livestock
#   care, dairy, harvest/hay, garden, poultry)'

# structured_incidents:
# - event: 'Sustained period: after her husband died, the holding was split or the lease
#     terms worsened and she struggled to keep animals and pay rents/taxes, relying
#     more on adult children and selling off stock and linen to get through bad years.'
#   reasoning: She experienced a downward shift after widowhood, and her lifetime spans
#     repeated shocks (poor harvest years, Revolutionary disruptions, changing property/tax
#     regimes), making at least one major hardship episode plausible.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: c. ages 50–56 (1790–1796), spanning early widowhood and the hardest Revolutionary
#     disruptions
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: 'Recurring pattern: she spent weeks at a time nursing a household member
#     through fevers and chest illness—keeping the hearth, preparing broths, and managing
#     the farm’s basic chores while the sick person was bedridden.'
#   reasoning: In a large kin network with high infectious and chronic disease burdens,
#     an adult woman commonly nursed sick spouses, children, or siblings for weeks/months,
#     especially after becoming a widow and co-residing with kin.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: c. ages 43–48 (1783–1788)
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: 'Sustained period: one parent (or an in-law) became frail and increasingly
#     dependent, and she regularly provided food, washing, and supervision and organized
#     help from siblings/kin while still running her own household work.'
#   reasoning: Elder care was usually family-based; however as the 5th of 6 children
#     she may not have been the primary caregiver unless parents lived long and other
#     siblings died/left, or she took in an in-law after widowhood.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: c. ages 34–40 (1774–1780)
#   type: elderly_parents
# - event: 'Single event/premarital courtship: during her engagement with a young man
#     from a nearby parish, they had sexual relations before the church wedding, discreetly
#     and with the expectation of marriage.'
#   reasoning: Premarital sexual relationships were common enough in rural France (often
#     within courtship) despite official norms, and local marriage-migration suggests
#     a typical courtship path.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: c. ages 19–21 (1759–1761)
#   type: premarital_sex
# - event: 'Single severe episode: one pregnancy ended in a late miscarriage or stillbirth,
#     with heavy bleeding and weeks of weakness; she was cared for at home with prayer,
#     household remedies, and the help of local women while she slowly recovered.'
#   reasoning: With 5 live births in a pre-modern setting, the chance of at least one
#     miscarriage/stillbirth/serious complication is high even if she ultimately survived
#     to old age.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: c. ages 28–31 (1768–1771)
#   type: pregnancy_complications
# - event: 'Sustained period: during Revolutionary/Napoleonic campaigning in the Nord,
#     troops passed through and were billeted nearby; requisitions of grain and hay,
#     fear of raids, and occasional violence around roads and markets forced the household
#     to hide supplies and limit travel.'
#   reasoning: Nord was repeatedly traversed/occupied (1740s campaigns; Revolutionary
#     and Napoleonic wars), making requisitions, troop billeting, local violence, or
#     temporary displacement quite plausible for a rural civilian.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: c. ages 53–56 (1793–1796)

Marie Jeanne Dufour was born on January 16, 1740, in the Avesnois countryside near Beaufort, in the northern borderlands of the kingdom of France. Her people spoke Picard at home and in the lanes after Mass, and the parish church set the calendar with saints’ days, processions, and the rules of marriage and inheritance. Her parents, Antoine Dufour and Marguerite Caron, worked as laboureurs on a holding that kept cattle and grew grain and hay; comfort came from land and animals, and from hands that could work.

She entered a family that already carried losses. Marguerite had buried two infants before Marie Jeanne could remember them: Anne in 1736 and Pierre in 1738. The household’s remedies sat beside its prayers. Marguerite kept a small bundle of blessed herbs from Assumption Day tucked into a beam and sprinkled holy water at the threshold during storms. When a child coughed too long, she tied a scapular to the shirt and muttered a charm as she rubbed goose fat into the chest, then still brought the family to confession when the priest called for it.

Marie Jeanne was the fifth of six children. Her eldest sister Catherine, born in 1732, moved with confidence through tasks Marie Jeanne would later inherit: salting meat, scalding a pig, laying out linen for a baptism. Jacques, born in 1734, took his place behind their father with the horses, learning to judge a field by its dampness and the weight of the soil on a spade. Marie Jeanne learned by being sent—fetching water, minding poultry, bringing bread to men in the meadow—then by doing the jobs no one watched closely, and finally by being watched.

The war that opened her life brought soldiers and talk more than battle. Men marched on the roads toward Maubeuge; travelers spoke of sieges farther off. Antoine counted sacks twice before market and told the children to stay in sight when strangers passed. Marie Jeanne grew up with the habit of checking doors and latches, even on days when nothing happened.

In 1753 her younger brother Louis, born in 1742, died at eleven. He had been the one she hauled on her hip when their mother’s hands were full, the child sent with her to gather kindling and keep her company on the path. After his death she took on his chores without being asked. She did them sharply, too. When Jacques left a gate swinging, she slammed it and told him, in front of their father, that he fed other people’s cattle when he let theirs stray. Antoine did not rebuke her for the words; he rebuked Jacques for the gate.

She never learned to read. The church’s Latin and the clerk’s French were sounds, not marks she could follow. She memorized prayers in Picard and knew the rhythm of the priest’s words. When she needed to keep track of things, she laid objects out—eggs in a row to count, coins in piles, lengths of linen folded the same way each time.

Catherine’s death came in 1764, at thirty-two. The news reached Beaufort through a neighbor who had been to the other parish for a baptism. Marie Jeanne helped wash the sheets for the funeral dinner and scolded a cousin for drinking too much beer before the work was done. It was grief expressed as order: scrubbed boards, full kettles, bread kept from burning.

By then she had already left her parents’ house. In 1759 she began walking home from Mass more slowly when Jean-Baptiste Lemaire fell into step beside her. He was from a parish a short distance away, close enough that the families recognized one another’s fields and surnames. He was broad-shouldered, steady with animals, and stubborn about how he held a tool. They met at market, too, where she sold butter and a little spun thread and he bargained for iron and salt. That winter he came to Antoine’s house to speak with her father. The following year, 1760, she and Jean-Baptiste began behaving as an engaged couple. They lay together before their wedding, once, in the back of a loft when the older people were outside with the animals. Afterward she became rigid about her own routine, counting the weeks in her head and watching her body for signs that would force a hurried marriage.

They married in 1761 in the parish church, with the priest reading words she could not follow but knew were binding. She moved to Jean-Baptiste’s home and took over its hearth. The first years were hard work and constant friction. She spoke quickly and did not soften her corrections. He answered in the same tone. They still rose before dawn, still put their shoulders into the same tasks. When she took milk to skim, she did it the same way every morning; when he harnessed the horses, he did it the way his father had. Quarrels ended not with apologies but with bread set on the table and work resumed.

Their first child, Marguerite Lemaire, was born in 1762. Pierre-Jacques followed in 1764, Jean in 1767. By then Marie Jeanne had become the woman other women sent for when a birth began unexpectedly. She was not a midwife, but she was steady with boiling water, clean linen, and blunt instruction. She also went to Sœur Barbe, a local wise-woman with a reputation for cures that sat comfortably beside churchgoing. Marie Jeanne carried Sœur Barbe’s little packets of dried herbs, and she tucked a blessed candle stub into a chest for emergencies. She prayed to the Virgin Mary with the rosary when she had one, and she used charms when fear rose in her throat.

Fear rose hard in 1770. Pregnant again, she began bleeding late in the term. Women gathered, and Sœur Barbe came with cloths and a jar of strong-smelling infusion. Marie Jeanne lost the child and bled heavily. For weeks she moved slowly, leaning on doorframes, skin pale against the dark of her hair. When strength returned, it returned as harshness: she snapped at children who tracked mud on the floor, and she checked the larder so often that Jean-Baptiste told her to leave the jars alone. She answered that jars did not fill themselves.

Marie-Anne, her fourth surviving child, arrived in 1772. Louis, their fifth, was born in 1775 and died the same year. Marie Jeanne had the infant baptized quickly. She kept the tiny cap and wrapped it in linen, stowed where her hands went when she was troubled.

From 1774 her parents began to need her. Antoine’s body slowed first. By 1776 he could not spend a whole day in the fields, and he sat indoors mending harness when his hands stopped shaking. Marie Jeanne walked back to Beaufort more often, carrying food, clean shirts, and news. She organized help from Jacques when she could and argued with him when she could not. Antoine died in 1778. Marguerite lingered longer, weaker each winter, and Marie Jeanne washed her, fed her, and kept her from falling when she rose. Marguerite died in 1782, with a candle blessed at Candlemas set near the bed and the sign of the cross made over her forehead.

The next years held illness again, this time drawn out. From 1783 to 1788 someone in Marie Jeanne’s household—Jean-Baptiste—cycled through fevers and a chest sickness that left him exhausted and coughing. She slept lightly and rose when he called. She boiled broth, rubbed his back with warmed oil, and kept the children in line so the farm did not stall. She also quarreled with Madeleine Hubert, a neighbor who came with soup and stayed long enough to comment on Marie Jeanne’s temper. Marie Jeanne told her to mind her own pot. Later, at market, they laughed together over the price of onions and traded gossip about a cow that had broken its leg, friendship and rivalry tangled in the same conversation.

Jean-Baptiste died in 1790. His death tore a hole in the household’s structure. He had been the one who talked with landlords and officials and measured out obligations. Marie Jeanne could count money but not read a lease. She depended on Pierre-Jacques, now a grown man, to interpret papers and speak with men who wore authority in their coats. She pushed him hard and accused him of withholding coins; he accused her of refusing reality. Jean steadied things when he could, but the household became smaller and more fragile.

Then the Revolution reached their village in rules and demands. The priest’s oath divided people. Marie Jeanne continued her prayers at home and kept her saints’ images, careful about what she said outside. During the war years, especially 1793 through 1796, soldiers moved through the Nord and requisitioned hay and grain. A corporal named Lefebvre came with papers and an impatient voice. Marie Jeanne hid a sack of grain behind stacked flax and told the children to keep quiet. She stopped going to market on days when the roads felt unsafe. Fear made her controlling; she counted what was left, scolded her daughter for waste, and checked the door latch repeatedly at night.

The crisis of those years was not one day but a grinding stretch. The holding was split and the terms worsened. Animals were sold. Linen she had spun and stored for years went out of the house for cash. She ate less so the younger ones could eat more, then argued bitterly when Pierre-Jacques spoke of taking what remained for his own household. She did not flatter or plead. She demanded.

Age did not soften her tongue, but it narrowed her world. After 1800 she stayed closer to home, taking satisfaction in small routines: the clean sweep of a hearth, a loaf baked evenly, a bowl of thick soup with a bit of bacon when there was bacon. She still enjoyed the noise after Mass, the quick exchanges in Picard, and the sharp humor of women who had done hard work all their lives. When she was angry she went to the edge of the yard and stood where she could see the fields, hands busy with a scrap of flax even if there was nothing urgent to spin.

Her eldest daughter Marguerite died in 1806 at forty-four, leaving Marie Jeanne with less help and fewer soft words in the house. Pierre-Jacques and Jean lived on, but their lives pulled them into their own responsibilities. In her last years she lived with Marie-Anne, who never married and kept the household together with plain meals and careful savings. The seasons remained. So did the state demands during Napoleon's time: men taken for service, animals and grain demanded for armies.

Cancer ended Marie Jeanne’s life on January 29, 1820, in the small household she shared with her unmarried daughter. Her body was washed and dressed, and the parish buried her in the churchyard with the priest’s prayers spoken over the grave.
