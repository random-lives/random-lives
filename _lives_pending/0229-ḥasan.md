Ḥasan was born on December 11, 1199, in a Mudéjar hamlet on the Castilian side of the frontier uplands, where Muslim families farmed and paid dues through Christian lords and their officials. In his household people spoke Andalusi Arabic, and his father, ʿAbd Allāh, managed orchards and fields worked by tenants, including a man named Yahyā who brought accounts and requests to the house.

On the seventh day Maryam arranged the naming. She washed the baby, wrapped him tight, and had Qur’an recited in the main room. Meat from the family’s animals went into a meal shared with kin, with extra portions sent out for the poor. She kept the kitchen busy after dawn prayers, then carried milk and eggs to a nearby market and returned with salt and oil. Cloth was always in hand: wool to spin, a small piece to mend, a bundle to trade. Fāṭima, born in 1193, hovered close. She handed her mother pins and thread, and she learned to keep Ḥasan calm while Maryam weighed produce and argued over measures.

Through 1200 he toddled in the yard, crawled under benches, and slept on rolled mats near his sister. Late in the summer of 1201 he fell ill and died on September 1.

Men washed his body and Maryam poured water over his head and limbs. They wrapped him in a plain shroud and carried him outside the settlement for burial, laying him in the ground facing the qibla and saying the funeral prayer.
