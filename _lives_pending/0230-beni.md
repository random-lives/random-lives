#     detail: After her father returns from a short carrying trip, Beni runs toward

#       or a small gourd he brought. When an aunt lifts it away, she shrieks, claws
#       at the object, and throws herself backward, then clings hard to her mother's
#       skirt—loud, social, and difficult to soothe.
#     moment: Market-return excitement and a 'mine' tantrum

#     detail: When her baby brother is laid near the hearth, Beni crowds close, tries
#       to wedge herself between her mother and the infant, and pokes at the swaddling.
#       She startles at the baby's cries, begins to cry too, and then swats at a caretaker's
#       hand when redirected—needing attention, anxious, and quick to anger.

#     trait: Very Low Agreeableness (5th percentile)

#       outbursts.
#     trait: Very High Neuroticism (93rd percentile)
#   - behavior: Hard to redirect; ignores simple prohibitions (stays away from hearth,
#       stop throwing stones), repeats the same forbidden action moments after being

#     trait: Low Conscientiousness (34th percentile)
#   - behavior: Delayed/limited speech (few stable words, much pointing and crying),

Beni was born on August 31, 989 in a Zapotec-speaking village in the high country north of the Oaxaca valley. Her family held a commoner house plot and worked milpa fields under local rulers who took labor and goods. At home they fed the ancestors with small offerings: a pinch of ground maize, beans, and copal resin burned on a shard near the hearth, with short spoken petitions.

Her father, Lachi, farmed and carried loads along the footpaths to nearby markets. Her mother, Dani, spent long hours at the grinding stone, hands white with lime from treated maize. They lived in an extended compound with Lachi’s mother Naa and Dani’s sister Pela. An older brother, Cali, had been born the year before and died before he could sit; his name stayed in the household’s quiet talk when the copal smoke rose.

Beni walked early and pushed into people’s space. She followed adults across the packed earth yard, loud and insistent, grabbing at anything new. In February 991 Lachi returned from a carrying trip with cord and a small gourd cup. Beni ran at him shouting her short word for him, then clamped both hands on the cord. When Pela lifted it away she screamed, clawed at it, and threw herself back, then latched onto Dani’s skirt and refused to let go.

Late that summer a new baby, Zani, was swaddled and set near the hearth. Beni pressed in close, tried to wedge between Dani and the infant, and jabbed at the wrappings. When Naa took her by the shoulder to turn her aside, Beni swatted at her hand and then cried hard at the baby’s wailing.

After the rains eased, on September 23, 991, Beni developed sudden diarrhea and could not keep down water. Her body was washed, wrapped, and placed in the ground near the household’s burial area. Dani and Naa burned copal and set a small bit of maize dough beside her.
