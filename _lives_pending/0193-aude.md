# ethnicity: Local Romance-speaking rural population of Vivarais/Velay (largely Occitan-speaking,
#   Latin Christian)
# father_occupation: Husbandman/peasant farmer managing a relatively substantial mixed
#   holding (crops + livestock)
# historical_context:
# - event: Capetian consolidation and increasing royal/administrative reach into the
#     south-central regions (more standardized dues, courts, and occasional extraordinary
#     levies passed down through lords).
#   timing: Ages 20-60 (c. 1250-1290)
# - event: A bad-harvest subsistence crisis affecting upland communities (grain shortages
#     and price spikes), forcing rationing, selling animals, or taking on debt.
#   timing: Most likely in one or more episodes during ages 25-65 (c. 1255-1295)
# - event: Severe winters and weather volatility in the later 13th century (including
#     hard winters like 1295–96) stressing fodder supplies, livestock survival, and
#     transport to markets.
#   timing: Ages 64-66 (c. 1295-1297)
# - event: Livestock disease episodes (cattle murrain/sheep disease) reducing traction
#     and dairy/meat output, a recurrent hazard for mixed farms in upland France.
#   timing: Any time; most plausibly midlife ages 30-60 (c. 1260-1290)
# - event: Monetization and market integration through fairs and nearby towns (greater
#     use of coin rents, opportunities and pressures to sell textiles/wool, and vulnerability
#     to price swings).
#   timing: Ages 20-70 (c. 1250-1300)
# household_social_status: Better-off peasant household (substantial holding; more animals;
#   possibly employing help seasonally)

#     name: Raimon
#     narrative_role: Substantial mixed-farm husbandman; practical, reputation-conscious,
#       and fair but capable of harsh discipline in lean years. Relationship with Aude
#       is affectionate yet shaped by expectations of work and obedience; his death
#       triggers inheritance adjustments and strengthens her reliance on her husband’s
#       household.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: 1276
#     name: Ermessenda
#     narrative_role: Textile-focused peasant housewife; teaches Aude spinning, flax
#       prep, and barter etiquette. Generally warm and steady; Aude’s high agreeableness
#       mirrors her. Her death is a late anchor-loss that pushes Aude into increased
#       caregiving for kin and grandchildren.

#     death_age: 40
#     death_year: 1296
#     name: Bernat (junior)
#     narrative_role: Son who reaches adulthood and becomes a working pillar of the
#       farm; helps with wood-cutting and herding. His midlife death (illness or accident
#       complications) shifts the inheritance path toward Aude’s daughter and precipitates

#   - birth_year: 1260
#     death_age: 81
#     death_year: 1341
#     name: Agnès
#     narrative_role: Daughter who remains locally rooted and becomes the household
#       successor with her husband; provides Aude with grandchildren and late-life security.
#       Their relationship is close, with occasional tension over Aude’s tendency to
#       over-give and under-plan.
#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 34
#     connection: Occurs during Aude’s established midlife management of textiles and
#       stores; the theft of yarn/cloth from an outbuilding pushes her to spin extra
#       and deepens her emphasis on locking/monitoring stores and relying on kin gossip
#       networks.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 41
#     connection: Linked to a hard-year shortage (bad harvest/price spike) and the need
#       for fuel; involves Aude and older children gathering beyond permitted wood,
#       reflecting the village’s blurred line between customary rights and prosecutable
#       theft.

#     phase: Later childhood / adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-50
#     key_events:
#     - '1250-1260: Four births; two early child deaths shape household piety and risk
#       management (extra care with infants, reliance on saints and parish rites).'
#     - '1260s-1280s: Monetization grows; Aude sells/barters yarn/cloth at nearby markets
#       and manages stored goods, while contributing to hay/harvest labor.'

#     name: Azalaïs
#     narrative_role: Older sister and early model for women's work; warm but sometimes
#       protective/teasing. Her death (likely illness/childbirth-related) becomes Aude’s
#       first clear memory of adult mortality and shapes her later piety and caregiving.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: 1234
#     death_age: 7
#     death_year: 1241
#     name: Pons
#     narrative_role: Younger brother whose brief life is tied to household hopes for
#       a male heir; Aude helps mind him as a girl. His death in childhood becomes a
#       quiet family sorrow that the parents rarely speak of.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds strong reciprocal support (help at harvest, childcare), but
#       also leaves her vulnerable to being taken advantage of (e.g., after the theft
#       she initially hesitates to accuse anyone).
#     scene: She mediates quarrels over shared tools/irrigation paths and is quick to
#       offer bread, thread, or labor to neighbors—even those who have slighted her.
#     timing: Most visible ages 25-70, especially after becoming a mother and later
#       as a grandmother
#     trait: Very high Agreeableness (85th)
#   - consequence: Maintains reputation and trust at market/parish; reduces likelihood
#       of escalation into serious crime or conflict, but can limit bargaining aggressiveness.
#     scene: She insists on fair measures when bartering yarn and is uncomfortable with
#       outright lying; when the family takes wood, she frames it as necessity and keeps
#       it discreet rather than boastful.
#     timing: Ages 20-50 (market years) and again during hardship in early 40s
#     trait: High Honesty-Humility (77th)
#   - consequence: Occasional shortages or last-minute scrambles (misplaced stores,
#       missed opportunities at market), and tension with more orderly in-laws; mitigated
#       by routine village rhythms and help from daughter later.
#     scene: She is prone to letting tasks pile up—mending delayed, accounts of who-owes-what
#       kept in her head—then working in bursts when deadlines (rent day, winter stores)
#       force action.
#     timing: Ages 18-60, especially when children are small and demands are highest
#     trait: Very low Conscientiousness (14th)
#   - consequence: Little romantic leverage but stable marriage prospects via work value;
#       can contribute to quiet self-consciousness without becoming a disorder.
#     scene: As a young woman she is treated as 'useful' rather than admired; courtship
#       is practical and negotiated through families, and she learns to lean on reliability,
#       gentleness, and textile skill rather than charm.
#     timing: Ages 14-22 (courtship/marriage) and intermittently in adult village interactions
#     trait: Very low Physical attractiveness (5th percentile) influencing social dynamics
# number_of_children: '4'
# number_of_siblings: '2'
# occupation: Peasant housewife and farm laborer on a mixed holding (household management,
#   childcare, food processing, seasonal fieldwork)
# religion: 'Mainstream parish Catholic practice: Mass on major feasts/Sundays when
#   possible; confession/communion mainly around Easter; baptism/marriage/funerals via
#   the Church; daily spoken prayers and saint/Marian devotion at home'
# sibling_ages_at_death:
# - 25
# - 7
# sibling_sexes:
# - F
# - M
# structured_incidents:
# - event: A neighbor (or someone passing through after a fair/market day) stole small
#     but valuable items from the household—most likely a few lengths of spun yarn/cloth
#     and some stored food—taken from an outbuilding while the family was busy with
#     seasonal work. The loss wasn’t ruinous but forced them to tighten provisions and
#     replace goods through extra spinning and barter.
#   reasoning: Even moderate peasant households experienced some theft (livestock, stored
#     grain, tools) or disputes over property; however, dispersed rural living lowers
#     some forms of opportunistic crime compared to towns.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Age 33-35
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: During a hard year, she and older children quietly took fallen wood and a
#     little green cutting from a lord’s or monastery-managed woodland beyond what was
#     permitted, carrying it home for fuel and repairs. It was a low-level, recurring
#     practice over the season (more a tolerated ‘custom’ than an openly admitted theft),
#     done to get through winter without buying fuel.
#   reasoning: Low conscientiousness could raise small-rule-breaking risk, but her high
#     honesty-humility and embeddedness in a village moral economy reduces odds of overt
#     theft; minor illicit acts (e.g., taking wood/grazing) were common.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Age 41-42
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime

Aude was born on June 27, 1231, in the upland country between Velay and Vivarais, where scattered hamlets sat among pasture, woodland, and small fields of grain. The land lay under layered authority: local lords with their dues and courts, the parish priest with the calendar of fasts and feasts, and beyond them the Capetian king’s growing reach through officials and written demands. In her home people spoke Occitan, and at Mass they heard Latin they could not read, watching the priest’s hands and the lifted Host.

Her father, Raimon, ran a substantial mixed holding with cattle, a few goats, and strips of rye and oats that did better than wheat at that height. Her mother, Ermessenda, kept the household fed and clothed and made cloth a steady second pillar under the farm: flax hackled and spun, wool teased and twisted, yarn traded for salt, iron, and lamp oil. Aude arrived as the second of three children. Azalaïs, her older sister, was already running errands between house and byre and showing Aude how to wind thread onto a stick without tangling it. When Aude was three, Ermessenda bore a son, Pons, and Aude grew up with his small voice underfoot.

They ate dark bread and porridge, greens from a garden patch, and cheese when milk held. Aude liked the first warm days when the snowmelt stopped biting and the road to the nearest market turned from mud to hard ruts. She followed her mother there, carrying a bundle of yarn wrapped in cloth and listening to bargaining that sounded like argument but ended in nods. She did not talk much with strangers. When a neighbor’s child cried, she went over to bounce the baby while the mother finished a task, and she accepted the same help without pride.

The household prayed with what they had: spoken Paternosters and Ave Marias; candles at the church on a saint’s day when there was a little spare; holy water brought home in a small flask after Easter. Ermessenda kept a small wooden cross by the bed, and Aude rubbed it with her thumb when she lay awake. She took to routine devotions more than to questions, repeating what she had been taught.

Pons died in 1241, after a short sickness that left him thin and restless. Aude had been ten, old enough to fetch water and wipe his face, too young to do anything that changed the end. After the burial in the parish ground, her parents worked with tight mouths. Raimon began to watch his stores and boundaries with sharper suspicion. He also used his belt more quickly on the girls when he thought they were idle. Aude learned to move fast when a command came. She also learned to smooth a quarrel before it grew, putting herself between raised voices, offering to take on the extra chore.

By fourteen she spun for hours, keeping the spindle steady while her mind drifted. She did better with work that had company. When Sibilla, an older neighbor woman, came to sit by the hearth and card wool, Aude found herself laughing at Sibilla’s blunt jokes about the village men and their hunger. On summer evenings, after animals were shut in, she liked sitting on the threshold with her hands still smelling of flax, watching bats cut low across the yard.

At seventeen, in 1248, Aude married Bernat, a man from a parish a short walk away, near enough that the ridge lines and saints’ days were familiar. The marriage was agreed by kin and neighbors, and she moved into his household with a chest of linen and simple goods. She learned his fields and the exact places where boundaries were supposed to run. Bernat’s mother tested her with tasks and sharp remarks, and Aude answered by working and by giving way in small matters so she could hold firm in the ones that fed the house.

Her first child, a son named Raimon, was born in 1250. Four years later he was dead, taken by an illness that turned quickly and left him quiet. Aude’s grief showed in her hands: she washed and rewashing the same linens, then sat still, counting prayers under her breath. She brought a candle to the church on the next Marian feast and pressed her forehead to the cold stone pillar while the priest sang.

Another son, Pons, was born in 1253 and died the same year, before he was a year old. That year also brought the death of Azalaïs, Aude’s sister, at twenty-five. Aude travelled back to her father’s house for the burial, standing with women whose faces she had known since childhood. She returned to Bernat’s home with a tighter way of holding her children when she had them.

Her third child, Bernat junior, arrived in 1256 and lived. Aude watched his breathing obsessively through his first winters, laying her hand on his chest at night. Her fourth child, Agnès, was born in 1260, a sturdy girl with a loud cry. Aude nursed her and still dragged water, carried fodder, and helped in the hay. She did not keep tidy accounts of who owed what or of what grain was due; she relied on memory and on Bernat’s temper to remind her. More than once she forgot a promised barter, and a neighbor waited at the gate and left annoyed. She made up for it with gifts—an extra hank of yarn, a dish of hot porridge—quick peace offerings that kept doors open.

Through the 1260s, more dues were demanded in coin and measured more strictly. Men spoke of new officials and written orders that came down through lords, and of cases going to courts farther away. Aude did not understand the details, but she felt the change in the way Bernat counted coins and in the way his jaw worked when rent day neared. She spun more, and she walked to markets with bundles of yarn and small lengths of cloth, trading for salt and a knife, sometimes for a little wine that she and Bernat drank watered in summer. She enjoyed the market’s noise for an hour, then wanted to be back where the forest muffled sound.

Raimon, her father, died in 1268. The holding did not become hers; rights and responsibilities shifted among men, and Aude’s access to kin land depended on goodwill. She kept that goodwill by showing up when help was needed. When Ermessenda fell ill years later, Aude visited often, bringing broth and clean linen, sitting beside her mother’s bed and rubbing her feet until the skin warmed. Ermessenda died in 1276, and after that Aude stopped traveling back as frequently; there was less there that required her, and more at home that demanded her hands.

At thirty-four, in 1265, she discovered theft. She had been busy with harvest work and had left a bundle of spun yarn and a small store of dried food in an outbuilding. After a market day, with strangers having passed along the road, she found the door unlatched and the goods gone. She accused no one openly. Instead she watched faces at the next Mass, and she did not let children wander near Hugon’s yard, a neighbor with a habit of lingering near other people’s fences. The loss forced the household to tighten provisions, and Aude spun late into the evenings to replace what had been taken, fingers sore, the spindle’s whir the only sound besides the fire.

A hard year came when she was forty-one, in 1272, with grain short and prices high. Fuel mattered as much as food; winter at that altitude made every bundle of wood count. Aude and the older children carried fallen branches from a woodland managed under a lord’s rights, then cut a little green wood beyond what was permitted. They went early and returned with loads before the paths filled. She told the children to keep quiet about it at the well. The household burned the wood, patched fences, and got through the season without buying what they could not afford.

In midlife she became the steady center of a moderate peasant household: not poor, not comfortable. She worked in bursts, letting mending pile up until the first frost made holes urgent, then staying up late with needle and thread. She avoided open conflict, but when Bernat struck her in anger during a dispute over stores, she absorbed it without leaving and later went to Sibilla’s house with a swollen lip and a story that blamed a clumsy fall. Sibilla said nothing in church, but she sent her teenage son to help Bernat with a heavy task the next week, an intervention that saved face and cooled tempers.

Years passed. Bernat junior grew into a man who could handle oxen and argue boundary lines. Agnès married Guilhèm, a man from nearby, and their children filled the yard with noise. When the late 1290s brought hard winters and difficult fodder, the household thinned its animals and guarded hay as if it were coin. In 1296, when Aude was sixty-five, Bernat junior died at forty. The farm’s future ran through Agnès and Guilhèm after that, and Aude and her husband stayed in the same house as their daughter’s family, a three-generation household that kept the holding working and provided care.

Old age narrowed Aude’s world. She sorted flax, watched grandchildren, and kept prayer routines. She went to Mass on major feasts and confessed at Easter, speaking softly to the priest and taking the wafer with careful hands. She liked warm bread with cheese and a little onion, and she claimed the bench by the hearth as her place. When annoyed, she retreated to the doorway and picked at a knot in thread until she could speak without heat.

By the winter of 1307 her body had slowed and stiffened. She died on December 19, in the house where her daughter’s children slept in the loft and where Bernat still sat by the fire. Her body was washed, wrapped in linen, carried to the parish church, and buried in the churchyard ground with prayers in Latin and a candle set near the grave until it burned down.
