#     narrative_role: Oldest sister; in 1910 she would be about 8, already useful and
#       parentified—sent on errands, watching smaller children. Likely remembered Rokhl

#     name: Rokhl
#     narrative_role: Protagonist; a fraternal twin who lived only a few months. Her

#     name: Yoysef
#     narrative_role: Fraternal co-twin and immediate younger sibling by minutes/hours;
#       survived. As an infant he would have been compared to Rokhl constantly (size,
#       strength). Later in life, he may have carried a family sense of being 'the twin
#       who lived.'

Rokhl was born on October 19, 1910, in Brooklyn, in a Yiddish-speaking Lithuanian Jewish household under the city government of New York, part of the United States. Avrom and Hinde lived in a small apartment with three daughters—Sore, Beyle, and Gitele—already trained to keep quiet during prayers and to leave the table when meat and milk dishes were being sorted for kashrut. Avrom worked long days as a clerk in a neighborhood shop, and he came home smelling of street dust and flour sacks. Hinde ran the home. She lit Shabbes candles in brass sticks on Friday afternoons and kept a kerosene lamp trimmed for winter evenings.

Rokhl arrived as a fraternal twin. Her brother, Yoysef, cried louder. Hinde wrapped both babies in flannel and set them in a shared cradle near the stove, turning them so neither lay in a draft. At night Avrom murmured the bedtime Shema and washed his hands from a small cup before eating bread. A few days after the birth he went to shul, where the gabbai called out the girl’s name, Rokhl, during the Torah reading.

Through the winter Hinde measured milk carefully and boiled water on the stove. Rokhl’s breathing stayed fast, and her lips sometimes turned dark when she fed. On March 2, 1911, a doctor wrote a death certificate naming a congenital defect. Avrom arranged a simple Jewish burial, and Rokhl was placed in the ground the same day with psalms recited over her.
