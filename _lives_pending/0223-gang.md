# cause_of_death: Acute infectious disease (fever/respiratory infection such as pneumonia/influenza-like
#   illness)
# ethnicity: Han Chinese (northern frontier rural subject/settler communities)
# father_occupation: Mixed smallholder farmer-herder (dryland grains + livestock; household
#   subsistence/market surplus)
# historical_context:
# - event: Frontier raiding cycle (inter-polity conflict and bandit/raider activity)
#     prompting village watch obligations, fortification of settlements, and periodic
#     disruption of herding routes and market travel
#   timing: Most likely in late teens/early 20s (c. 398–405)
# - event: State or warlord demands for horses, cattle, and grain from frontier households
#     (requisitioning for armies/retainers), incentivizing concealment of livestock
#     and increasing tensions over pasture and fodder
#   timing: Intermittent, more likely during mobilizations (c. 392–405)
# - event: Episodes of abnormal winter severity (deep snow, icing, extreme cold) causing
#     livestock losses and forcing changes in fodder use and herd management
#   timing: Any winter; especially likely to matter during his herding ages (c. 396–405)
# - event: Drought/poor rainfall years reducing grass growth and dryland grain yields,
#     raising local food prices and increasing reliance on stored grain and livestock
#     slaughter
#   timing: Any 1–2 year spell during his lifetime; more consequential in the late 390s
#     or early 400s

#   + tending small stock near home (plus textiles/childcare)'
# narrative_plan:
#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: null
#     name: De
#     narrative_role: Household head in Gang’s childhood; mixed farmer-herder. Values
#       order and labor; gives Gang simple, repetitive tasks and scolds him for forgetting
#       instructions, but keeps him within the kin net rather than casting him out.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: null
#     name: A'bao
#     narrative_role: Primary day-to-day caretaker early on; manages dairy and small
#       stock, textiles, and children. Protective and practical, quietly compensating
#       for Gang’s limitations by pairing him with older kin and shielding him from
#       ridicule.
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: 389
#     name: Grandmother Liu
#     narrative_role: Early childhood presence who enforces household rites and tells
#       spirit stories; interprets illness and misfortune through local ritual logic.
#       Her death removes a buffer between Gang and his father’s harsher discipline.
#     role: paternal grandmother
#   - death_year: 384
#     name: Uncle Yong
#     narrative_role: Represents the earlier joint-household stage; his death is one
#       reason the compound shifts from joint (multiple married brothers) toward a simpler
#       extended household structure.
#     role: paternal uncle (father's brother)
#   - death_year: 391
#     name: Aunt (Yong’s widow) Mei
#     narrative_role: Stays for a time after Yong’s death; her eventual departure/return
#       to natal kin (or death) marks the household’s contraction and reduces adult
#       supervision options.
#     role: aunt by marriage
#   children: []
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 18
#     connection: Occurs during communal fodder gathering/harvest lodging when Gang
#       is away from strict household oversight; later makes him anxious about gossip
#       when marriage negotiations begin.
#     incident: premarital_sex
#   - age: 18
#     connection: Begins as opportunistic keeping of strays and cutting unguarded hay
#       during fodder pressure years; becomes a repeated habit because it is simple,
#       low-skill, and rewarded by praise for keeping animals fed.
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   - age: 20
#     connection: Winter herding/watering task; accident leads to weeks of dependency,
#       heightening household tensions and making later accusations (about animals)
#       easier to pin on him.
#     incident: serious_accident
#   - age: 20
#     connection: Crooked-healed leg limits riding and long drives; pushes him toward
#       closer, more observable tasks, increasing scrutiny from neighbors and enforcers.
#     incident: acquired_disability
#   - age: 21
#     connection: During warm-season insecurity, armed men search homes and demand stock;
#       the household hides animals, reinforcing Gang’s earlier habit of concealment
#       and fear-driven compliance.
#     incident: civilian_war_exposure
#   - age: 22
#     connection: Complaint about kept strays/hay theft escalates under tense conditions
#       and requisition pressure; enforcers punish publicly to deter concealment and
#       to show control during unstable times.
#     incident: faced_punishment
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6
#     key_events:
#     - '381–382: Infant survival rituals and household offerings; women compare him
#       to the sister who died as a baby, increasing vigilance around illness.'
#     - '384: Death of Uncle Yong; household begins shifting away from a true joint
#       household toward a smaller extended household.'

#   - age_range: 7-13
#     key_events:
#     - 'c. 388–394: Persistent learning difficulties become unmistakable (can’t retain

#   - name: Hu
#     prominence: Ages 18–22; key to property-crime conflict and the complaint leading

#       incident
#   partners:
#   - name: An
#     narrative_role: Wife in a first arranged marriage; relationship is pragmatic and

#     name: Shun
#     narrative_role: Older brother and primary male model in the household; competent

#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: 379
#     death_age: 13
#     death_year: 392
#     name: Qing
#     narrative_role: Older sister who helped mind Gang when he was small; her death
#       in early adolescence becomes a formative memory (mourning rites, fear of fever
#       years) and increases domestic workload on the mother.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Family channels him into routine herding/watch duties; older brother
#       and mother cover bargaining, tallies, and dealings with officials—also making
#       him a convenient scapegoat when disputes arise.
#     scene: As a boy, he cannot reliably count animals beyond small numbers or follow
#       multi-step instructions; he repeats tasks exactly as shown but becomes lost
#       when conditions change (new pasture, missing rope, unexpected visitor).
#     timing: Visible from ages 7–8 onward; emphasized again after marriage when household
#       responsibilities increase
#     trait: Likely intellectual developmental disorder (very low intelligence, 4th
#       percentile)
#   - consequence: He is trusted with repetitive guarding and care tasks despite low
#       skill; his rule-following also means he confesses or freezes when confronted
#       by enforcers.
#     scene: He rises early, checks tether knots repeatedly, circles the pen again and
#       again, and grows distressed if the daily routine is disrupted; he perseveres
#       at tedious tasks (dung/fuel collection, watching small stock) without complaint.
#     timing: Adolescence through adulthood (ages 14–24), strongest after his disability
#       limits him to near-home work
#     trait: High conscientiousness (84th percentile)
#   - consequence: Contributes to neighbor complaints and makes informal resolution
#       harder, increasing the chance of formal punishment.
#     scene: In disputes over strays, he becomes stubborn and defensive, insisting animals
#       'mixed in' rather than admitting; he is not skilled at smoothing conflicts and
#       can escalate arguments with blunt refusals.
#     timing: Late teens into early 20s (ages 18–22) when property tensions peak
#     trait: Low agreeableness (35th percentile) / modestly low honesty-humility (39th
#       percentile)
# number_of_children: '0'
# number_of_siblings: '3'
# occupation: Household herding/livestock tender (routine care of sheep/goats/cattle/horses;
#   fodder/water; manure/fuel tasks)
# religion: Household ancestor/domestic rites + regular recourse to local spirit-medium/healing
#   rituals (frontier shamanic influence)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: 'Recurring pattern: while tending the household’s animals on open grassland,
#     he occasionally cut another household’s unguarded hay and quietly kept a few strayed
#     sheep/goats that wandered into his watch, passing them off as mixed-in stock rather
#     than reporting them.'
#   reasoning: Petty theft/poaching and evasion of dues were not rare among commoners,
#     but as a household-dependent herder (not an independent trader) he had fewer opportunities
#     and higher family supervision.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Ages 18–22 (mostly in late summer/early autumn when fodder and animals were
#     being gathered and moved)
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime
# - event: 'Single event: during a winter drive to a water/ice hole, a startled horse
#     jerked and knocked him down; he was dragged a short distance and his lower leg
#     was badly broken, leaving him bedridden for weeks in the family compound.'
#   reasoning: Herding and riding/handling livestock create real risk of serious nonfatal
#     injury with weeks of incapacity (falls, trampling, fractures).
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 20 (mid-winter, after first heavy snows)
#   type: serious_accident
# - event: 'Sustained condition: the leg healed crooked and painful, leaving him with
#     a lifelong limp and reduced stamina; afterward he was assigned closer-to-home
#     herding and watch tasks rather than long drives or riding far.'
#   reasoning: Some serious incidents lead to lasting impairment (limp, loss of fingers,
#     partial vision/hearing loss), but most young adults recover functionally.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: From age 20 until death at 24
#   type: acquired_disability
# - event: 'Single event: before his marriage was arranged, he had a brief sexual encounter
#     with an unmarried young woman from a nearby household during a communal work period
#     (fodder gathering/harvest lodging), kept quiet by both families to avoid scandal.'
#   reasoning: Premarital sex occurred despite norms, and rural courtship/seasonal labor
#     gave opportunities; most likely nonstandard element for a man who married young-ish.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 18–19
#   type: premarital_sex
# - event: 'Sustained period: a small raiding party and armed retainers passed through
#     the area during a local conflict, forcing village households to hide animals and
#     grain; he witnessed homes being searched and a neighbor beaten when they resisted
#     giving up livestock.'
#   reasoning: Even without migration, raids or temporary occupation could affect villages;
#     still, not everyone experiences direct siege/occupation/displacement.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 21–22 (over several weeks in the warm season)
#   type: civilian_war_exposure
# - event: 'Single event: after a complaint that his household had kept strayed animals,
#     local enforcers made an example of him—he was publicly caned (light beating) and
#     his family had to return stock and pay a small compensation in grain/cloth to
#     the aggrieved household.'
#   reasoning: Most village fights were settled informally within kin networks, but
#     frontier authorities did punish serious assaults or killings; probability rises
#     if violence occurred outside the lineage or during militia duty.
#   tier: 2

Gang was born at the end of winter in 381, in a scattered rural settlement on the grasslands of the far northeast frontier. The household spoke Chinese at home and used another frontier tongue with neighbors and passing herders. Control of the region shifted among northern strongmen and their retainers, and the household measured politics by horse levies, grain demands, and the need to post night watches rather than by distant capitals.

His father, De, kept a mixed living: dry fields of millet and beans near the settlement and animals out on the open ground where grass grew best. His mother, A’bao, ran the yard: she milked, made sour curds and butter when there was enough, dried dung for fuel, and kept thread moving between her fingers when she sat. When Gang was small, Grandmother Liu was still alive. She handled the household rites. At the new moon she set out a small tray by the hearth with millet gruel, a few slices of dried meat, and a cup of thin ale, and she spoke the names of ancestors whose graves lay beyond the settlement.

Gang was the fourth child. Shun, his older brother, was five when Gang arrived and already helpful, quick to repeat words he heard from travelers. Between them had been two sisters: A’lan, who lived only through one summer and the next winter, and Qing, who was close enough in age to Shun that she played and worked alongside him. When Gang was three, the household still held the shape of a joint compound. De’s brother, Uncle Yong, had a wife, Mei, and there had been talk of Yong taking more animals out toward better pasture. Yong died in 384. The compound did not split; it tightened. Mei stayed for a time, then dwindled into illness and died in 391, leaving no new branch to manage.

Gang’s earliest tasks were small and repeated: bringing kindling, holding a goat for milking, carrying a bucket that sloshed onto his legs. He learned by doing the same thing the same way. When anything in the sequence changed, he froze and stared. De tried to correct him with sharp words and quick slaps to the shoulder. Grandmother Liu stepped between them more than once, pushing Gang back toward the women’s work and telling De to let him grow.

Grandmother Liu died in 389. Without her, A’bao became the only steady shield. She kept Gang close, gave him jobs he could finish, and praised him for sticking to them. Shun began counting animals and sacks, and he did not like that he always had to recount after Gang. When asked to bring three ropes, Gang returned with two or with a bundle of frayed cord. Shun laughed once, then stopped laughing and began to bark instructions as if to a younger child.

Qing’s death came in 392. She fell sick during a season when coughs and fevers moved through the settlement. A’bao boiled herbs and kept water warmed by the stove. De went to Old Woman Yan, the spirit-medium, and returned with a paper charm stamped and smeared with ash, to be burned and mixed into water. Qing still died before winter. The household washed her body, wrapped her, and set bowls of grain and salt by the place where she lay before burial. Gang watched the adults’ hands, then copied what he could: he set out an extra cup and stood still until someone took it away.

By ten, Gang spent long stretches away from the yard, close to home but outside the fences. He watched calves and sheep and gathered dung in a basket. He liked the quiet hours after sunrise when the animals settled into grazing. He liked warm curds with chopped scallion when A’bao had enough milk. He did not like being sent to barter. He could not follow prices and he could not keep track of what had been promised. De stopped trying. Shun took that work and complained that he always had to.

Gang grew into a young man of average height and plain face. When he was fourteen he began doing full days with sheep and goats, then with horses when Shun or a cousin rode with him. He checked tether knots again and again until his fingers hurt. If a knot looked different, he untied and retied it, even when told to stop. That habit pleased De. It also made Gang slow. Neighbors mocked him for it, and he answered with stubborn silence or sudden anger.

Pressure rose as Gang approached manhood. Retainers came more often, asking about horses and demanding fodder. Some years the grass came thin, and the household saved hay and chopped stalks as if every bundle mattered. In late summer of 399, Gang joined other households in cutting and stacking fodder. People slept in rough shelters near the fields and pasture edges, with fires kept low. One night there, at eighteen, he had sex with Lin, an unmarried girl from a nearby household. It was quick and wordless, arranged by glances and the absence of elders. Afterward he avoided her, because he could not manage talk. Lin also avoided him. When marriage discussions began the next year, both families kept silent.

That same season, Gang began doing something he understood better than bargaining. When he found a patch of another household’s hay left unguarded, he cut a little and carried it off in his own bundle. When a sheep wandered into his watch, he did not drive it back. He folded it into the mixed herd and later swore it must have been theirs all along. He repeated this in 400 and 401, always in late summer and early autumn. He did it with the same careful routine he used for knots. It did not feel like a choice to him; it felt like finishing a task.

De arranged Gang’s marriage in 401. His wife, An, came from a household close enough that her kin could walk to visit. She moved into De’s compound and took up dairy work under A’bao’s eye. Gang did not move out; he ate at the same hearth, slept in the same yard, and followed the same older men.

The winter after the wedding brought heavy snow and hard ice. During a drive to a water hole cut through river ice, a horse jerked and bolted. Gang fell and the animal dragged him a short distance by a rope looped around his wrist. His lower leg broke. He lay on a mat inside the compound while A’bao boiled water and An fed him thin porridge. De splinted the leg with boards and cloth strips. Old Woman Yan came and shook a rattle over him, then tied a small knot of cloth and hair to a post near the doorway to keep wandering spirits away.

Gang got up again, but the leg healed crooked. He limped and could not ride far. He could not keep up with long drives to the best grass. De and Shun gave him closer tasks: watching small stock near the settlement, sitting at the pen gate, and keeping animals hidden when strangers approached.

Strangers approached more than once in 402. A small raiding party and armed retainers passed through during a local conflict between rival groups. Men searched houses for grain and tack. Families moved animals into reeds and low gullies. Gang saw a neighbor beaten in front of his doorway after arguing over a cow. The household held its tongue, gave up a little, and kept the rest out of sight.

By 403, complaints about strays sharpened. Hu, a neighboring herder, accused De’s household of keeping animals that did not belong to them. Gang argued poorly, repeating the same phrases until Hu spat and walked away. Shun told Gang to stay quiet in future disputes. Gang did not. He insisted and dug in, and his voice rose in a way that invited attention.

In 403, local enforcers came, led by a man named Zhi who carried a baton and wore a belt with metal fittings. Hu had lodged a complaint. Zhi questioned De, then Gang, and Gang answered with the same stubborn denial he used with neighbors. Zhi ordered him held in the open space near the compound gate. Gang was publicly caned. De returned a few animals and paid compensation in grain and cloth. For the rest of that season, Gang stayed close to the yard, angry and watchful, his limp worse from the beating.

He and An had no child. An’s monthly bleeding continued, and A’bao spoke to her quietly and brought her warming foods. De did not shout about it, but he watched An’s hands and work and treated her as a worker first.

In late autumn of 405, cough moved through the settlement again. Gang continued to sit by the pen gate with a staff across his knees, counting animals by touch and habit rather than number. He developed a high fever and a deep cough that rattled his chest. Old Woman Yan was called; she burned a charm and mixed the ash into water, and A’bao dabbed his lips with it. Gang died before the new year.

The household washed him, wrapped him in cloth, and carried him to burial ground outside the settlement. A small bowl of millet and a strip of dried meat were set by the grave before the earth was packed down.
