# father_occupation: 'Peasant cultivator (primary work: farming family fields; seasonal
#   crop work)'
# historical_context:
# - event: Interstate warfare and raiding in the Huai–Si / eastern Zhou frontier zone
#     (shifting control among neighboring states), increasing insecurity, requisitions,

# - event: Yellow River and local river-system flooding/siltation episodes affecting
#     fields, housing, and grain storage (a persistent North China Plain hazard even
#     without a single precisely dated local flood).
#   timing: sporadic; most likely experienced at least once in adulthood (ages ~20–60)
# - event: Strengthening of lineage/ancestral ritual obligations and local cult practices
#     as community organizers in the Eastern Zhou period, increasing demands for seasonal
#     offerings and communal labor/feasting during festivals.
#   timing: ongoing; most salient in adulthood and old age (ages ~18–71)

# narrative_plan:
#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: -540
#     name: Wei
#     narrative_role: Peasant cultivator; stern, expects obedience and labor; respects
#       Xiu’s sharpness but punishes defiance. Dies when Xiu is ~27, leaving her natal
#       household more vulnerable and increasing pressure to secure alliances through
#       marriage.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: -522
#     name: Mei
#     narrative_role: Household production and textile work; emotionally guarded but
#       reliable, teaches Xiu spinning, food processing, and how to read people without
#       words. Relationship is practical rather than tender. Lives long enough to meet
#       Xiu’s first children, then dies when Xiu is ~45.
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: -555
#     name: He
#     narrative_role: Co-resident elder at Xiu’s birth; enforces ritual propriety and
#       hierarchy, frequently sides with the father in disputes. Teaches ancestral-offering
#       routines and village norms; dies when Xiu is ~12, marking the end of the most
#       tightly controlled childhood years.
#     role: paternal grandmother
#   - death_year: -556
#     name: Rong
#     narrative_role: Quiet authority; less harsh than grandmother, sometimes shields
#       Xiu from excessive scolding. Dies around the same time as grandmother (Xiu ~11–12),
#       after which household labor burdens shift more onto the mother and daughters.

#     narrative_role: Eldest; competent and sharp-tongued like Xiu, becomes a key helper
#       in textile work and household management. Dies in Xiu’s early 60s, leaving a
#       gap in women’s labor and emotional support.

#   - birth_year: -545
#     death_age: 25
#     death_year: -520
#     name: Wei
#     narrative_role: First surviving son; ambitious and restless, pulled toward state
#       labor/guarding work. His early death (mid-40s for Xiu) intensifies Xiu’s anxiety
#       and hardens her distrust of officials and levies.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: -542
#     death_age: 20
#     death_year: -522
#     name: Lan
#     narrative_role: Daughter who dies young (likely illness); remembered through small

#   - birth_year: -539
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: -539
#     name: Bo
#     narrative_role: Infant son who dies shortly after birth, reinforcing the ever-present

#   - birth_year: -536
#     death_age: 58
#     death_year: -478
#     name: Rong
#     narrative_role: Long-lived son who becomes household head in later years; pragmatic,
#       sometimes clashes with Xiu over her bluntness but provides protection and food
#       security. Core relationship in widowhood and old age.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: -533
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: -533
#     name: Su
#     narrative_role: Infant daughter who dies; her brief life becomes part of the household’s
#       ancestral offerings and the women’s private laments.
#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 20
#     connection: Occurs early in marriage after a dispute about work/obedience; reinforces
#       Xiu’s guardedness and tactical compliance, feeding later distrust and blunt
#       antagonism within the household.
#     incident: sexual_violence
#   - age: 30
#     connection: After the regional relocation and amid local unrest/raiding rumors,
#       stored millet and hemp cloth are stolen; this pushes the family to tighten storage
#       practices and increases Xiu’s readiness to bend rules later.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 35
#     connection: In a lean year with heavy demands, she hides part of the yield and
#       trades some covertly for salt; links to her low honesty-humility and high problem-solving
#       under pressure.
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   - age: 42
#     connection: Fall while hauling water/fuel; the injury forces reliance on female
#       kin (daughter, daughter-in-law, neighbors) and redefines her role from primary
#       laborer to manager/teacher.
#     incident: serious_accident
#   - age: 45
#     connection: Chronic winter cough and breathlessness follow repeated smoke exposure
#       and fevers; interacts with grief period and reduces her tolerance for cold,
#       conflict, and heavy work.
#     incident: chronic_illness
#   - age: 60
#     connection: Vision loss (cataract-like) makes fine textile work and sorting grain
#       difficult, shifting her contribution toward supervision, storytelling, and ritual
#       instruction; increases dependence and irritability.
#     incident: acquired_disability
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-7
#     key_events:
#     - Grows up in a three-generation peasant household with strict hierarchy; early
#       training in offerings, food preparation, and avoiding waste.
#     - Learns caution around illness after the remembered death of the firstborn boy
#       and other village infant losses.
#     - Shows early quickness (counting measures, noticing patterns in weather/fields)
#       and a tendency to argue when corrected.
#     phase: Early childhood (natal household under grandparents)
#   - age_range: 8-17
#     key_events:
#     - Grandparents die around ages 11–12; workload shifts and Xiu becomes a primary
#       helper to her mother in textiles and seasonal field tasks.
#     - Periodic levy/corvée demands on men tighten household margins; Xiu learns to
#       store, stretch, and substitute foods.
#     - Household relocates regionally due to insecurity/pressure (timed before marriage),
#       severing some village ties and reshaping marriage prospects.
#     phase: Later childhood and adolescence (labor apprenticeship; growing unrest)
#   - age_range: 18-34
#     key_events:
#     - Patrilocal marriage to Qin at ~18; initial conflicts with husband/in-laws over
#       obedience, work pace, and speech.
#     - Bears first three children in quick succession and learns to manage both childcare
#       and textile output for exchange/tax needs.
#     - Local disorder episode in late 20s/early 30s leads to heightened insecurity
#       and tighter household controls.
#     phase: Early adulthood (marriage; childbearing; adaptation to new household)
#   - age_range: 35-55
#     key_events:
#     - Lean year prompts concealment of grain from collectors; Xiu becomes more calculating
#       about officials and obligations.
#     - Experiences multiple bereavements (adult sister at 37; son at 25; daughter at
#       20) amid chronic stress.
#     - Serious fall injury in early 40s reduces mobility for months; afterwards winter
#       cough becomes recurrent and gradually limiting.
#     phase: Midlife (scarcity strategies; losses; injury and long decline begins)
#   - age_range: 56-71
#     key_events:
#     - Husband dies; Xiu remains in her son Rong’s household, shifting from heavy labor
#       to supervision, childcare, and ritual expertise.
#     - Vision declines from late 50s; she increasingly relies on grandchildren/daughter-in-law
#       for fine work and safe movement at dusk.
#     - Dies at 71 after an acute respiratory infection during a cold season, in a crowded
#       household where smoke and close quarters worsen illness.
#     phase: Widowhood and old age (three-generation household under surviving son)
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Zhen
#     prominence: Major in early adulthood (ages 18–30); primary source of domestic
#       hierarchy conflicts and enforcer of norms.
#     relationship: Mother-in-law in husband’s household
#   - name: Jia
#     prominence: Prominent in adulthood (ages 25–55); conduit for local news, small
#       trade opportunities, and mutual aid during illness.
#     relationship: Neighbor woman and occasional exchange partner (salt/cloth/grain)
#   - name: Ke
#     prominence: Appears episodically (ages 30–40); represents state demands, measures,
#       and the risk side of concealment/underreporting.
#     relationship: Village headman/collector’s aide (local official intermediary)
#   - name: Yu
#     prominence: Prominent in widowhood/old age (ages 55–71); day-to-day caregiver
#       and household manager who alternates between respect and friction with Xiu.
#     relationship: Daughter-in-law (wife of son Rong)
#   partners:
#   - name: Qin
#     narrative_role: Husband from a similar-status farming household in the region
#       where her family relocates. Hardworking and often away on corvée; expects obedience.
#       Relationship is functional but tense; early years include coerced sex after
#       conflict. He dies when Xiu is ~55, leaving her a widow in her adult son’s household.

#   - birth_year: -569
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: -569
#     name: Bo
#     narrative_role: Older brother who died as an infant; his death hangs over the
#       household as a warning about hunger, illness, and the fragility of children,
#       shaping how adults treat Xiu as a 'spared' child.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: -565
#     death_age: 37
#     death_year: -528
#     name: Lan
#     narrative_role: Younger sister and early companion in domestic work; later becomes
#       an adult tie to Xiu’s natal kin after Xiu’s marriage and regional relocation;
#       her death in Xiu’s early 40s is a hard blow during an already strained period.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Creates household tension and occasional retaliation; also earns
#       a reputation for being hard to cheat, which sometimes protects the household
#       in trades.
#     scene: She openly challenges her mother-in-law’s instructions and later argues
#       with collectors/elders over measures and fairness, refusing to soften her words
#       even when warned.
#     timing: Most visible in early adulthood (ages 18–30) and again in widowhood when
#       she feels less constrained (ages 56–71).
#     trait: Very low Agreeableness (19th percentile)
#   - consequence: Improves short-term survival odds but increases risk of community
#       resentment and potential punishment if discovered.
#     scene: She is willing to conceal grain, manipulate stated yields, and present
#       a carefully crafted story to officials and neighbors when resources are at stake.
#     timing: Midlife scarcity period (ages 33–40), recurring thereafter as a quiet
#       strategy.
#     trait: Low Honesty-Humility (27th percentile)
#   - consequence: Occasionally improves household output and resilience; also makes
#       her less deferential to 'we’ve always done it this way,' intensifying conflict
#       with elders.
#     scene: She experiments with planting/processing tricks learned from travelers
#       and neighboring villages (e.g., different soaking/fermenting for grain, new
#       weaving patterns), and is curious about stories from other states.
#     timing: Adolescence through midlife (ages 12–45).
#     trait: High Openness (74th percentile)
#   - consequence: Raises her informal authority within the household despite gender
#       constraints; contributes to both survival strategies and sharper interpersonal
#       conflict.
#     scene: She quickly spots inconsistencies in measures during tax collection and
#       bargaining, remembers debts/obligations without writing, and strategically times
#       storage and exchanges.
#     timing: Throughout adulthood (ages 18–65).
#     trait: High Intelligence (75th percentile)
#   - consequence: Smaller support network outside kin; when crises hit, help comes
#       mainly from lineage ties rather than broad friendships.
#     scene: She keeps to household and close kin, speaks little at communal feasts,
#       and prefers one-on-one bargaining rather than public haggling.
#     timing: All phases; especially after chronic illness begins (ages 45–71).
#     trait: Low Extraversion (35th percentile)
#   - consequence: Promotes vigilance and preparedness but increases irritability and
#       weariness, especially in winter and during shortages.
#     scene: After child deaths and levy rumors, she anticipates worst outcomes, double-checks
#       stores, and has sleep disturbed by winter coughing and worry.
#     timing: Midlife through old age (ages 35–71).
#     trait: Slightly elevated Neuroticism (56th percentile)
# number_of_children: '6'
# number_of_siblings: '2'
# occupation: Peasant farmer-household worker (domestic production + seasonal field
#   labor; food processing, childcare, fuel/water)
# religion: Household/lineage ancestor offerings (food/liquor, seasonal rites) plus
#   local village cults to earth/grain/river deities; occasional divination/folk healing
# sibling_ages_at_death:
# - 0
# - 37
# sibling_sexes:

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During a period of local disorder after her household relocated, someone
#     broke into their yard store and stole a sack of millet and a length of hemp cloth
#     that had been set aside for tax or barter, leaving the family short until the
#     next harvest.
#   reasoning: Peasant households routinely faced petty theft (grain, tools, cloth)
#     and occasional robbery during disorder, though low surplus limits attractiveness
#     as targets.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: late 20s to early 30s (around ages 28–32)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: In a lean year she quietly underreported part of the household’s grain yield
#     and hid some millet in a secondary jar so the tax/levy collectors would take less;
#     she later traded a small portion for salt without declaring it.
#   reasoning: Everyday norm-bending like underreporting produce, illicit gleaning/poaching,
#     or small theft was fairly common among hard-pressed peasants, and her low honesty-humility
#     raises the chance.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: mid 30s (around ages 34–36)
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime
# - event: Soon after marriage, her husband (and/or his household) treated sex as an
#     unquestioned marital right; at least once, after a quarrel, he forced intercourse
#     despite her resistance, which she could not openly contest within the patrilocal
#     household.
#   reasoning: Sexual coercion within marriage and opportunistic assault during disorder
#     were real risks for rural women; her regional migration due to upheaval increases
#     exposure, though we cannot assume stranger-rape is typical.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late teens to early 20s (around ages 18–22)
#   type: sexual_violence
# - event: While carrying a heavy load of water/fuel along an uneven path, she slipped
#     and fell hard, injuring her hip/leg; she was unable to work the fields or walk
#     normally for many weeks and relied on female kin for daily tasks.
#   reasoning: Agricultural labor, hauling water/fuel, and cooking with fire create
#     substantial risk of falls, fractures, animal injuries, or burns; over a long life,
#     at least one weeks-long incapacitating accident is plausible but not guaranteed.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 40s (around ages 41–43)
#   type: serious_accident
# - event: After repeated winters of smoke-filled cooking fires and bouts of fever,
#     she developed a chronic cough and breathlessness that flared each cold season,
#     limiting heavy work and leaving her easily exhausted.
#   reasoning: Surviving to 71 in a hard-labor setting makes some chronic limitation
#     (joint/back disease, chronic respiratory issues, parasitic/infectious sequelae,
#     “wasting” episodes) fairly likely even if she remained functional.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: mid 40s through late 60s (around ages 45–69)
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: In later life her vision deteriorated (likely cataracts/age-related loss),
#     making fine textile work and sorting grain difficult; she increasingly needed
#     others to thread needles, identify small impurities, and move safely at dusk.
#   reasoning: Age-related vision/hearing decline, arthritis-related mobility impairment,
#     or post-injury disability were common, but not all would be clearly disabling;
#     this is a subset of serious health problems rather than the default.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late 50s to death (around ages 58–71)
#   type: acquired_disability
---

Xiu was born into the Huaxia world of the Eastern Zhou, where officials from competing states pressed villages for grain and labor and where people measured their lives by planting, levies, and the ancestral calendar. Her family spoke the local Sinitic tongue and lived on dry fields near the rivers and old tracks that led east and south. In the yard stood clay jars for millet, hemp bundles under the eaves, and a small place for offerings: a low stand blackened by smoke where cooked grain and a cup of liquor were set out to the family dead.

Her first brother, Bo, had died in infancy two summers before she was born. Adults did not speak his name often, but his absence shaped how food was portioned to children and how quickly a cough was feared. Xiu came into a three-generation household. Her paternal grandmother He ruled the women’s work with a hard voice and an exact sense of what belonged where. Her grandfather Rong sat near the door when he was home, repairing handles and watching the yard. Her father Wei worked the fields and carried his share of state demands; he returned from corvée with cracked hands and a short temper. Her mother Mei spun hemp thread in the dim light and measured porridge by habit, not by cups.

Xiu learned early that the household ran on rules and memory. When she was small she watched Mei rake coals forward, set a pot on the hearth, and drop in husks and scraps for pig feed. She liked the sound of grain being poured into jars and would count the handfuls aloud until He snapped at her to be quiet. If a neighbor’s child took a peach from their tree, Xiu did not let it pass. She followed the child to the lane and demanded it back, standing too close and speaking too plainly. He laughed once at that, then cuffed her for her tone.

When Xiu was three, a sister was born—Lan—small and loud, with a grip that hurt when she clutched hair. Xiu carried Lan on her hip while Mei weeded, and she learned to calm the baby by walking in steady circles and humming a tune she made up from the rhythm of the loom. She did not like crowds. At village gatherings she stayed near the cooking fires, watching who took the best pieces of meat and who hid extra. When she felt wronged, she argued without lowering her eyes.

At eleven, the household changed quickly. Rong died in the spring, and He followed him before the next winter ended. Their deaths ended the daily scolding, but it also meant fewer hands for hauling and fewer elders to speak for them when officials came. Xiu became a main worker beside her mother. She spun hemp until her fingers blistered, then twisted the thread tight again, refusing to waste the fiber. She liked the moment before dawn when the air was cool and the yard quiet; she would sit on the threshold with a bowl of thin millet gruel, adding a pinch of salt when she could, and watch the smoke rise straight.

Through her teens, men passed on the road with news of fighting and shifting borders. Fields near waterways were cut by new ditches, then abandoned when a rumor of raiders spread. Wei went out more often for demanded labor, leaving Mei and the girls to manage the house. Xiu listened to returning men talk about measures and penalties. She remembered which officials took bribes and which counted every stalk.

When she was sixteen, her family moved. The pressure came as orders and threats, then as neighbors leaving in groups. Wei led them to another village a few days’ journey away, still within the Huaxia-speaking countryside but under different local authority. They carried jars, a loom beam, and the ancestor tablets wrapped in cloth. The new place had different faces and different village factions, and Xiu’s sharp tongue won her no welcome.

At eighteen she married Qin, a farmer from a household like her own. She moved into his family’s yard and learned their arrangement of jars and tools. Her mother-in-law Zhen expected obedience in every small thing—how to fold cloth, how to greet guests, how to portion grain before the new moon. Xiu did not soften her voice. They quarreled over water trips and over what to offer at the household rites: steamed millet cakes, a cup of thin liquor, and a few slices of dried meat for the ancestors when meat was available. Qin wanted quiet in the evenings. When Xiu challenged him after a long day—about his mother’s demands, about how he spoke to her—he forced her in their sleeping space, gripping her arms until she stopped struggling. Afterward she did not confide in anyone. She rose before light, washed her face at the jar, and went back to work with a tight mouth.

Children came quickly. A daughter, Mei, then a son, Wei, then another daughter, Lan. Xiu worked with a baby tied to her back, bending to weed and then returning to the loom. She watched measures closely at exchanges. When she took cloth to trade, she insisted on seeing the salt weighed twice. Her neighbor Jia, who traded in small lots and knew everyone’s shortages, began to seek her out. Jia laughed easily; Xiu did not, but she listened, and she saved her rare smiles for moments when Jia told a sharp joke about an arrogant headman’s bad counting.

Her father died when she was twenty-seven, worn down by years of field labor and corvée demands. Word reached her through a traveler. She could not leave the household to mourn properly; the fields needed tending and Qin would not spare her. She made offerings at the household altar and said the words herself.

In her late twenties, disorder reached their village. Men stopped traveling alone. Grain stores were checked at dusk. One night, when Xiu was thirty, someone forced the yard store and stole a sack of millet and a length of hemp cloth set aside for levy and barter. In the morning she inspected the broken latch and the prints in the dust, then walked straight to the lanes and confronted a household she suspected. Zhen told her to stop before she brought trouble. Xiu kept pressing until Qin dragged her back by the elbow. That year they ate more greens and less grain. Xiu remembered the missing cloth every time her fingers tugged at the worn sleeve of her jacket.

Two years later she bore a son, Bo, who died soon after birth. She washed him, wrapped him, and handed him to the older women without argument. Then another son, Rong, survived, and after that a daughter, Su, who also died in infancy. Xiu did not make ritual speeches. She kept a tight record in her head of what each death had cost—cloth, time, strength, and the extra offerings demanded at the next rites.

A lean year came when she was thirty-five. Collectors arrived with their measures, accompanied by Ke, an aide to the headman who liked to show his authority. Xiu had already moved a portion of millet into a secondary jar hidden behind bundles of stalks. When the collectors counted, she kept her face still and spoke little. After they left, she traded a small portion for salt through Jia, avoiding the usual watchers. The salt went into the household pot in careful pinches, and Xiu took quiet satisfaction in the taste.

When Xiu was forty, word came that her younger sister Lan had died at thirty-seven.

At forty-two she fell while carrying a heavy load of water and bundled fuel along an uneven path. The pain in her hip and leg kept her from squatting, from walking steady, from hauling anything. For weeks she lay on a mat near the hearth. Her eldest daughter Mei and neighbor Jia brought her broth and herbs; Zhen complained about the lost labor. Mei took over the loom and the careful sorting of grain. Xiu watched, correcting with sharp words even when her voice made Qin grimace.

After that injury, a winter cough settled into her. Each cold season it returned with breathlessness. Smoke from the cooking fire made it worse. She moved away from the hearth when she could, sitting near the door where the air was clearer, and she avoided long walks to the fields. She still managed the household stores, telling the children exactly how many handfuls of grain belonged in the pot, and she scolded anyone who spilled.

When Xiu was forty-five, her daughter Lan died at twenty. In the same season, her mother Mei died back in the village where Xiu was born. Two years later, her son Wei died at twenty-five after a brief sickness that left him unable to work. She began to wake at night with her chest tight, and she grew quick to anger when children were slow to obey.

Qin died when Xiu was fifty-five. The household did not divide. Xiu remained in her son Rong’s yard, now under his authority. His wife Yu ran the daily cooking and childcare. Yu and Xiu clashed over small matters—how to speak to a neighbor, how much cloth to trade, whether a child’s fever meant a spirit’s displeasure. Xiu insisted on the offerings: a bowl of millet, a cup of liquor, and a few sprigs of mugwort burned for the hearth and the earth. She took the grandchildren to the offering place and taught them the names of the dead: Bo, Lan, and those infants who had not lived long enough to be remembered by anyone else.

Her vision began to cloud when she was sixty. Threading a needle became difficult. Sorting grit from grain at dusk was impossible. Yu's hands guided hers sometimes, and Xiu snapped at her for touching too slowly. She spent more time sitting in the yard, listening to the work sounds and correcting by ear—how a pestle should strike, how a loom should thump. In the evenings she told the children stories she had heard from travelers about far states and strange rules, then cut herself off when Yu said she was filling heads with nonsense.

When Xiu was sixty-two, her eldest daughter Mei died at forty-one. Mei had been the one who took over the loom when Xiu's injury first slowed her, the one who sorted grain and kept the household accounts in her head. After Mei was gone, Xiu sat longer in the yard and spoke less.

In her last winter, at seventy-one, the cough turned into an acute sickness. She could not sleep lying flat and sat propped near the door, wrapped in layers that smelled of smoke. Rong called for herbs and hot water; the household kept the fire going. Xiu died in the cold season, while the yard was stiff with frost and the grain jars were sealed.

They washed her body, dressed her in a clean hemp garment, and laid her in the family burial ground outside the settlement. At the offering place they set out millet and a cup of liquor for her spirit, and they added her name—Xiu—to the household’s remembered dead.
