Ami was born in a small farming settlement on the low hills and wooded plain near the sea in what is now southern Shandong. No chiefs ruled beyond the village and its allied households; standing came from family ties, stored grain, and who could gather people for seasonal rites. The household spoke an unrecorded local tongue and marked the farming year with communal meals and weather rituals at planting and harvest.

Her father, Oru, kept millet fields and storage pits and spent the days after the birth hauling reeds and brush for fuel, checking woven fences, and moving baskets of grain to the driest part of the house. Her mother, Nara, stayed close to the hearth. Sana, an older woman in the household, took charge of warm water, clean wraps, and the quiet instructions given to new mothers. Ami’s older brother Koru, a toddler, was kept from the sleeping area and sent outside with a scrap of cake to keep him busy.

Ami fed at the breast and slept swaddled. Nara rubbed her belly with warm hands and laid her on a mat near the fire smoke. On the sixth day, Pali the birth attendant returned and washed Ami’s stump with a steeped plant infusion and ash.

In her third week, the skin around the stump hardened and oozed. Ami stopped taking milk well and cried in short bursts. She died before dawn.

Oru dug a small pit at the edge of the settlement’s burial ground. Sana placed a pinch of millet and a bead of bone beside Ami’s wrapped body, and Nara pressed damp earth down with both palms.
