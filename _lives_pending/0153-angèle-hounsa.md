#     name: Mathurin
#     narrative_role: Youngest brother; benefits from Angèle’s literacy (forms, letters,
#       job applications) and later helps her with repairs and transport when she ages.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Others come to rely on her; she becomes overextended and has difficulty
#       setting boundaries, especially during caregiving periods.
#     scene: She routinely takes on extra tasks at school (copying lists, calming children,
#       mediating parent complaints) and in family meetings she volunteers to 'handle
#       it' rather than argue.
#     timing: adolescence through midlife (ages ~15–55)
#     trait: Agreeableness (very high)
#   - consequence: Sleep disturbance and somatic complaints (headaches, stomach tightness);
#       she seeks reassurance from church and kin rather than confrontation.
#     scene: Before market trips or payday she re-checks her wrapper knot and money
#       stash repeatedly, imagining worst-case outcomes; after theft incidents she develops
#       persistent worry about school fees and sickness.
#     timing: midlife onward, especially 1990s–2010s (ages ~35–60)
#     trait: Neuroticism (very high)
#   - consequence: Financial organization is uneven, making her more vulnerable during
#       austerity and after theft losses; she compensates by leaning on structured church/school
#       routines.
#     scene: At home she procrastinates on long-term planning (repairs, savings goals)
#       and relies on last-minute effort; at work she performs best when tasks are routine
#       and supervised.
#     timing: young adulthood to midlife (ages ~20–50)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (low)
#   - consequence: Fewer patronage connections; she advances through reliability rather
#       than networking, and she is less likely to seek help early.
#     scene: In meetings she speaks softly or not at all, preferring one-on-one conversations;
#       she avoids large celebrations unless required by kin/church duty.
#     timing: lifelong, most visible in youth and early work years (ages ~10–35)
#     trait: Extraversion (very low)
#   - consequence: Stability and consistency, but missed opportunities (e.g., reluctance
#       to try new businesses or relocate for better pay).
#     scene: She is skeptical of new schemes and prefers familiar ways of doing things—traditional
#       foods, known prayer routines, established school procedures—and hesitates to
#       move far from her region.
#     timing: adulthood (ages ~20–70)
#     trait: Openness (very low)
#   - consequence: Chronic tension contributes to health strain and reliance on prayer/church
#       support; not disabling enough to halt work/family roles.
#     scene: She has periods of persistent worry and tearfulness during stress (austerity,
#       thefts, caregiving), but continues functioning—showing up, feeding people, and
#       completing tasks—without prolonged incapacitation.
#     timing: midlife and later adulthood (ages ~30–70)
#     trait: Subclinical distress (no clear disorder)
# number_of_children: '3'
# number_of_siblings: '8'
# occupation: Salaried job (teacher aide, clerk, health/community worker)
# religion: Catholic-centered practice (regular church participation; minimal/mostly
#   private traditional observances such as ancestor respect)

#     and small household savings stolen—once from a bag during a crowded market day
#     near Allada/Toffo and other times through small break-ins at home (missing stored
#     grain, a radio, and later a bicycle/parts), losses serious enough to disrupt school
#     fees and household purchases.'
#   reasoning: Living and working in southern Benin across decades (including market/transport
#     contexts at least occasionally) creates repeated exposure to theft, scams, or
#     burglary; even modest households experience routine property crime.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Late 30s to mid-40s (c. 1992–2001)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: 'Sustained period: she obtained and kept a respected salaried position as
#     a primary-school support worker (monitor/assistant) after completing training/qualification,
#     becoming known locally for reliable record-keeping and helping children from rural
#     families—an uncommon path for women from her village background.'
#   reasoning: A salaried job and full literacy for a rural-born woman of the 1955 cohort
#     is a meaningful marker of success, but "notable" recognition beyond the local
#     community is less common.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Mid-20s through early 40s (c. 1980–1998)

Angèle Hounsa was born on February 10, 1955, in the Atlantique area of southern Dahomey, in a Fon-speaking family where people talked about fields, palm bunches, and market days more than politics. The French administration still ran the schools and kept registers, but in her household what mattered was the parish calendar, family elders, and the rainy season.

She never slept her first nights in her mother’s room. Her father, Koffi Hounsa, and her mother, Assiba Dossou, sent her straight to a nearby household, to Koffi’s elder sister, Tantine Yawa Hounkponou. People explained it simply: Yawa had space, she had discipline, and she wanted a child in her house. Angèle grew up hearing two names for “home,” one that meant her parents’ compound and one that meant the courtyard where she actually fetched water.

Yawa ran her household on a schedule of chores and church. Angèle rose early, swept the packed earth, and learned to keep the cooking area clean before school. Yawa’s husband, Oncle Pascal Hounkponou, traded when he could and farmed when he had to. He kept his money wrapped in cloth and counted it slowly. Angèle watched him and learned to count too, on a slate and later in an exercise book. She spoke Fon in the yard and picked up basic French from catechism and school, enough to greet a teacher, read a short sentence, and answer when spoken to.

The independence years came when she was small. Men argued in low voices about flags and new leaders, then went back to their hoes. The changes that reached Angèle were smaller and more direct: new forms, new stamps, new teachers who replaced older ones. Yawa insisted that her foster daughter attend Mass and catechism. Angèle liked the order of it—standing, sitting, the same prayers each week. She memorized lines easily, and when she made mistakes she swallowed them and kept going.

She had eight siblings, but she did not live among them. She heard their names and their troubles when Assiba visited or when a messenger came. The oldest sister, Sètché, had died as a baby before Angèle was born; the family spoke of that death with a kind of precision. Monique, two years older than Angèle, grew up with their mother. When Monique came to visit as a teenager, she inspected Angèle's clothing and laughed at how neat Yawa kept her. Gaston, their older brother, treated Angèle as half-sister and full sister at once—friendly, but ready to remind her she was not the one who carried water for their mother every day. Angèle answered teasing with a small smile and let him win the talk. After Angèle came more children: Chantal in 1957, then Odile, then Bernadette, then Victoire, and finally Mathurin in 1965. Angèle learned their names from visits and messages, watching the family grow from a distance. She felt closest to Chantal, who was nearest in age, though they never shared a room.

School held her attention more than most things. She was quiet and did not join the loud children who dared each other to run from the teacher. She copied carefully when a teacher wrote on the board. When political unrest shook Dahomey in the 1960s, the adults’ fear made her cautious. She kept her eyes down when men argued. She learned who to greet first. She started carrying small coins in different places, not all in one knot of cloth.

In 1972, when Mathieu Kérékou seized power, party language entered the town meetings and school talk, and the state looked for people who could keep lists and fill out attendance sheets. Angèle did not like crowds or speeches. She preferred the small room beside the school office, a pencil in hand, a clean ledger. Sœur Cécile, a catechist who taught reading after school, pushed her toward work that used her literacy. "You can read; that is a tool," she told her in French, then repeated it in Fon.

After finishing basic schooling, Angèle stayed near her foster family and helped with paperwork—copying letters for neighbors, filling out forms for church groups. In 1975, at a funeral gathering in Toffo, she met Sébastien Agbo. He was older by a few years, a man who fixed engines and drove trucks on hire, and he noticed how carefully she wrote a name in the condolence book. They spoke only briefly that day, but he came back twice more that year—once bringing fabric for Yawa as thanks for a letter Angèle had written, once with a message about a shared cousin's wedding—and stayed longer each time. The following year they married.

They first lived near his mother and younger brother in a village outside Allada. Angèle did not chase novelty; she arranged her household and learned the local ways. When she felt uncertain, she went to church, sat at the side, and waited until her breathing slowed. She kept her Catholic practice steady, though she also spoke of her ancestors in private, naming them when a child fell sick or when she needed to ask for patience.

Their first son, Luc, was born in 1978. A year later, Directeur Mensah at the local primary school asked Sœur Cécile if she knew a literate woman for a new auxiliary post. Cécile suggested Angèle, and Mensah arranged for her to attend a short training course in Allada—two months of instruction in record-keeping, basic health, and classroom management. Sébastien's mother watched Luc while Angèle traveled twice a week to the sessions. When she returned, Mensah hired her. She tracked notebooks, collected fees, and copied certificates. She kept her own notebook tucked into her wrapper, filled with reminders and sums and sometimes short prayers in careful French.

Three years after Luc came Armand, and in 1986 their daughter Clarisse. Angèle carried infants on her back and still showed up at the school because the household depended on her wage. Sébastien's earnings rose and fell with fuel prices and the condition of the roads. When he had work, he came home tired and satisfied; when he did not, he sat outside the compound and talked with other men about politics or engines, and Angèle learned not to ask too many questions.

The wage did not make her rich. It made the household predictable. During the economic crisis of the late 1980s, predictability became fragile. Some months the salary came late. Prices rose and stayed high. Angèle's worry tightened her jaw. She re-counted money before sleeping and again before dawn. She did not tell Sébastien how frightened she felt. She asked him if he had eaten, if his shirt needed washing, if he could borrow a part from a cousin instead of buying it new.

Tantine Yawa died in 1987. She had been frail for two years, moving more slowly, forgetting names. Angèle traveled back to sit with her, to wash her feet, to listen to instructions about the household that no longer applied. When Yawa stopped breathing, Angèle washed her body and helped arrange the funeral. She had been Yawa's child, and now she was no one's.

In 1990 the National Conference brought a new political atmosphere, and people talked more openly. Angèle did not enjoy those discussions. She preferred practical news: which clinic had medicines, which bus line was running, which parish group collected for funerals. She found comfort in small routines. She liked the taste of warm akassa with pepper sauce at midday. She liked sitting on a low stool at the doorway in the late afternoon, shelling peanuts while Clarisse practiced reading.

In 1992 she went to a crowded market day near Allada with cash for Luc's secondary school fees and a new cooking pot. At home she had wrapped the money carefully and tucked it deep, but in the press of bodies her bag opened. She discovered the theft only when she tried to pay. She stood still, said nothing, and felt heat rise into her face. At home she cried quietly while stirring a pot, so the children would not hear. After that she hid money in several places and checked them too often.

In 1994, thieves entered the house while they were away. Grain was gone. The radio disappeared. The loss was not only the objects; it was the feeling of being watched. Sébastien wanted to accuse neighbors. Angèle resisted open conflict and focused on replacing what mattered most. She borrowed, repaid, and adjusted meals. Afi Kpodji, a market friend, teased her for being too trusting and helped her learn which days were safest to travel, which routes were quieter, who to pay to keep an eye on a courtyard.

Her father, Koffi Hounsa, died in 1995. His funeral pulled all the siblings together—Monique organizing the women's cooking, Gaston arguing with cousins about the burial plot, Odile arriving late with her husband and children. Angèle felt the old tension of being both inside the family and slightly aside. She spent money she could not easily spare because she could not bear to be the one who arrived empty-handed.

By the late 1990s, another theft took her bicycle, which she had depended on for errands and the commute to school. She found it stripped for parts behind a neighbor's shed, and though everyone suspected who had done it, no one could prove anything. Walking lengthened her days. In 1998, Oncle Pascal died after a short illness, and the obligations of his funeral fell partly on her—she was still Yawa's child, still expected to contribute and appear. That year she stepped back from her school work, taking fewer hours, letting younger women handle the registers.

Her mother, Assiba Dossou, died in 2006. Angèle traveled for the funeral and sat among her siblings, feeling again like the one who had been sent away—even though she had come back, even though she had contributed money, even though she had stayed by Assiba's bed in the final weeks. Bernadette and Victoire handled most of the cooking; Mathurin, now a grown man with his own family, organized the men's side.

In 2007, dizzy spells and headaches sent Angèle to a clinic where Infirmier Alain explained pills and salt in simple French. He said the word "hypertension" and wrote it on a piece of paper for her. She took medicine when she remembered, then forgot for days, then doubled her attention again.

Sébastien died in 2008, suddenly, on a road outside Cotonou. A truck he had been working on slipped its jack. Luc came to tell her, and she sat very still for a long time before she could speak. Widowhood altered her standing in small ways: how men greeted her, how she counted money, how quickly she went home after church. She moved into a smaller room attached to Luc's compound, where she could help with his children and he could keep an eye on her health.

She helped raise Luc's children, walked to church on Sundays, and visited her siblings when she could afford the transport. Armand had moved to Cotonou and rarely came home; when he did, he brought gifts but no steady help, and Angèle worried about him in ways she did not speak aloud. Clarisse stayed closer, married a schoolteacher, and called every few weeks to check on her mother's health.

In 2016 her younger sister Chantal fell seriously ill. Angèle became the person who coordinated family contributions, kept receipts, and sat beside Chantal during long nights. She cooked soft foods, washed cloths, and listened to Chantal speak in short bursts. When Chantal died in 2018, Angèle handled lists again—who had given, who still owed, which cousin promised a goat and brought nothing. She did not shout. She looked away, waited, and then asked again in a calmer voice.

Now, in late 2025, Angèle lives within southern Benin, close enough to family that people arrive without warning. She wakes early, prays, and straightens the small corner where she keeps her church booklet and a pen. Her sons visit with sacks of rice or a bit of cash; Clarisse calls and comes when she can. Angèle still writes names carefully when the parish needs a list. In the afternoon she sits at her doorway with peanuts or beans to sort, listening to the sounds of children passing, and she checks that her money is tied where she put it.
