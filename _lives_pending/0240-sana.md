# Debug information (not displayed on page):
# Age at death: 1
# Birth date: April 17, 60201 BC
# Birth year: 60201 BC
# Climate now: Today the Lower Nile is in a hot desert climate with very low rainfall;
#   most natural flood dynamics have been heavily altered by dams and water management.
#   The floodplain and Delta are densely farmed and urbanized, with natural wetlands
#   greatly reduced and fragmented.
# Climate then: Around 60,200 BC the Lower Nile floodplain likely remained a dependable
#   water-and-food corridor even as surrounding regions were generally cooler and drier
#   than many later Holocene phases. Seasonal flooding would have created a mosaic of
#   wetland and grassier floodplain habitats, but with stronger aridity pressure at
#   the desert margins and fewer extensive savanna-like landscapes away from the river
#   than during peak 'Green Sahara' periods.
# Cultural tradition: undifferentiated
# Death date: April 19, 60200 BC
# Environment: 'A narrow but highly productive ribbon of riverine habitat: braided or
#   shifting Nile channels, seasonally inundated floodplain, natural levees, backswamps
#   and marshy patches, with desert rising quickly on both sides. Resources would have
#   centered on freshwater, fish, waterfowl, riparian plants, and large and small game
#   visiting the river corridor, plus abundant stone from nearby desert margins for
#   toolmaking.'

Sana was born on a narrow strip of green along the Lower Nile floodplain, where a small band moved between reedbeds, levees, and higher sand ridges as the water rose and fell. No chiefs ruled the camp. Decisions came from older hunters and mothers, and disputes ended with people shifting their sleeping places. At dusk they spoke to the dead by name and left fish bones and a pinch of ground seed at the edge of the dark water for river-spirits that brought illness.

His mother, Mina, carried him against her chest in a sling of softened hide. His father, Teno, set net lines in shallow channels and walked to the desert margin for stone when the camp’s flakes ran short. Sana’s older brother Kori was already a grown boy. He kept toddlers back from the fire, fetched water in a skin, and returned from the marsh with a coot or a string of small fish, holding Sana once his hands were washed in sand and water.

In Sana’s first wet season, mosquitoes thickened in the still pools behind the natural levee. Mina slapped at his skin and rubbed him with crushed aromatic leaves. His heat began one afternoon after feeding. Teno brought a duck egg and a strip of liver; Sana refused both. The next day his body stayed hot even in the shade, and his limbs jerked.

They buried him on a low sand rise above the flood line, wrapped in a reed mat. Mina placed a small fish vertebra and a flake of fine stone beside his head, then covered him with sand and river silt.
