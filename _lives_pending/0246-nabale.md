# ethnicity: Other Bantu-speaking peoples of the northeastern Congo basin (non-Mongo
#   cluster; local riverine/forest communities)
# father_occupation: Hunting/trapping-focused forest livelihood with some farming/fishing
# historical_context:
# - event: Intensification of long-distance trade along Congo basin river corridors
#     (exchange in iron goods, cloth, salt, and increasing demand for captives/ivory),
#     bringing intermittent outside traders and shifting local incentives for raiding
#     and alliance-building.
#   timing: Childhood through adulthood (1640s–1660s)
# - event: Regional pattern of inter-community raiding and counter-raiding (often tied
#     to competition over people, river access, and trade goods), periodically increasing
#     insecurity on paths, fields, and river landings.
#   timing: 'Most likely mid-life exposure: 1650s–1660s'
# - event: High and fluctuating malaria burden with occasional especially severe rainy-season
#     years (more mosquitoes, more fever cases), affecting work capacity, pregnancy
#     outcomes, and community labor availability.
#   timing: Recurring across life; peaks in wet years (1640s–1660s)
# - event: Diffusion of new ritual/medicine practices and protective cults (responses
#     to raids, sickness, and accusations), increasing the social importance of diviners/healers
#     and certain community obligations.
#   timing: Adolescence to adulthood (1650s–1660s)
# household_social_status: Ordinary free/commoner household (typical lineage members;

#     name: Mokali
#     narrative_role: Forest-oriented hunter/trapper who provides meat and prestige
#       items; emotionally reserved but protective. Dies during Nabale’s early adulthood,
#       weakening her natal household’s leverage in later marital conflict.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: 1673
#     name: Mangala
#     narrative_role: Primary cultivator/food processor; warm but demanding about work

#       bond is strong though sometimes tense over gossip and obligations.
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: 1655
#     name: Kondé
#     narrative_role: Early-life authority on etiquette and ancestor offerings; reinforces

#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 1660
#     name: Sokela

#     death_age: 2
#     death_year: 1664
#     name: Bokila

#   - birth_year: 1665
#     death_age: 1
#     death_year: 1666
#     name: Tombé
#     narrative_role: Last child within marriage; his death precedes or overlaps the
#       final breakdown and Nabale’s move back toward natal support.
#     sex: M
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 16
#     connection: Occurs during adolescence; increases household emphasis on secrecy,
#       obedience, and staying close to known paths—reinforcing her very low openness
#       and social withdrawal.
#     incident: civilian_war_exposure
#   - age: 16
#     connection: During the same raid episode; later invoked as justification for fear
#       of travel/strangers and reluctance to engage in trade interactions.
#     incident: witnessed_atrocity
#   - age: 21
#     connection: Begins after recurrent illness/exhaustion and rising marital tension
#       following early child deaths; overlaps with domestic violence escalation.
#     incident: sexual_violence
#   - age: 22
#     connection: Recurring through mid-20s; worsened by food stress, accusations surrounding
#       infant deaths, and reduced natal leverage after father’s death (1662). Ends
#       in negotiated separation/return (1666).
#     incident: domestic_violence
#   - age: 25
#     connection: Happens while still tied to husband’s area (or shortly after returning);
#       incapacity increases conflict over labor contributions and accelerates her move
#       toward living apart.
#     incident: serious_accident
#   - age: 27
#     connection: Occurs in the post-separation period at a riverside landing; tied
#       to heightened suspicion and competition over food/planting material in insecure
#       times.
#     incident: physical_assault
#   - age: 28
#     connection: Develops after separation when she is intermittently living alone/with
#       non-kin and needs material support; relationship remains outside recognized
#       marriage.
#     incident: extramarital_sex
#   - age: 28
#     connection: Arises from the relationship with Lomako; triggers disputes and reputational
#       risk, contributing to her social marginality before death.
#     incident: pregnancy_outside_marriage

#     - '1662: Father Mokali dies; natal kin support becomes less forceful in negotiations.'
#     - '1664-1666: Domestic violence escalates; kin intervene after severe beating;
#       separation and return toward natal compound.'
#     phase: Young adulthood and marriage
#   - age_range: 27-30
#     key_events:
#     - '1664-1665: Serious ankle injury limits work; increases dependence and exposes
#       her to gossip about being ''useless'' or ''cursed''.'

#       and trade goods; not intimate but influential in local gossip networks.
#   partners:
#   - name: Nsala
#     narrative_role: Husband from a nearby settlement; marriage begins as an alliance
#       between kin groups. Relationship deteriorates under food stress, suspicion,

#     death_year: 1649
#     name: Yalika

#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: 1652
#     death_age: 38
#     death_year: 1690
#     name: Makena
#     narrative_role: Youngest surviving sister; when Nabale is a married woman, Makena
#       is the adolescent runner between compounds. She later supports Nabale’s return
#       and helps during Nabale’s ankle injury recovery.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Seen as dependable but stubborn; less adaptable during food stress
#       and more anxious about outsiders/traders.
#     scene: She insists on doing gardens and food processing 'the old way' and refuses
#       to try a new planting spot or unfamiliar preparation method suggested by a co-wife/neighbor,
#       even when yields are failing.
#     timing: Adolescence into married life (ages 13-24)
#     trait: Openness (very low, 0th percentile)
#   - consequence: Fewer allies in her husband’s compound; less protection when accused
#       or when violence occurs.
#     scene: At communal work parties or river landings she stays at the edge, speaks
#       little, and lets others bargain; she avoids singing/dancing roles that would
#       put her in the center.
#     timing: All phases, especially adult life (ages 18-30)
#     trait: Extraversion (very low, 6th percentile)
#   - consequence: Reputation for fairness helps her remain 'in good standing' despite
#       separation, but also makes her vulnerable to exploitation.
#     scene: When food is short, she refuses to take from shared stores without permission
#       and publicly returns a misplaced tool rather than keeping it, even though others
#       hint she could.
#     timing: Later childhood and adulthood (ages 10-30)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (very high, 92nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Adds friction in the compound (fuel for accusations about laziness)
#       and worsens dependence during crises.
#     scene: She can work hard in the moment but struggles with long planning—forgetting
#       to prepare extra cuttings or misjudging storage needs—leading elders to scold
#       her for being 'slow to arrange things'.
#     timing: Married life and after accident (ages 19-30)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (low, 14th percentile)
#   - consequence: Less agency in negotiations; others shape the story around her, contributing
#       to marginal living arrangements.
#     scene: She has difficulty following complex kin-negotiation talk and proverbs
#       during dispute meetings, relying on her mother/sister to interpret and speak
#       for her.
#     timing: Marital conflict period (ages 22-29)
#     trait: Intelligence (low, 16th percentile)
# number_of_children: '4'
# number_of_siblings: '5'
# occupation: Subsistence cultivator and food processor (fields/gardens; pounding/fermenting/cooking;
#   household provisioning)
# religion: Household/lineage ancestor rites and offerings (food/beer, invocations at
#   home or family shrines; life-cycle rituals) + occasional community rituals

# - F
# structured_incidents:
# - event: During a period of instability in her marriage, her husband (or a senior
#     male in his compound) forced sex on her when she refused after illness and exhaustion
#     from field work; it was treated locally as a private household matter rather than
#     something to report outside the kin group.
#   reasoning: In her context, coercive sex could occur both within and outside marriage,
#     and her later separation plus living alone increases vulnerability.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Ages 20–23 (recurring pattern over months)
#   type: sexual_violence
# - event: Arguments over food stores, her labor obligations, and suspected infidelity
#     escalated into beatings—slaps and strikes with a switch—sometimes in front of
#     co-residents in the compound; her natal kin later negotiated her return after
#     one particularly severe assault.
#   reasoning: Intimate-partner physical violence was a common risk in many historical
#     rural societies, and marital breakdown is consistent with at least one episode.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Ages 21–26 (recurring pattern)
#   type: domestic_violence
# - event: At a riverside landing during an exchange of fish and garden produce, another
#     woman (supported by a male relative) accused her of taking cassava cuttings/food
#     and attacked her; she was knocked down and kicked, leaving her bruised and unable
#     to carry loads for days.
#   reasoning: Non-domestic fights/assaults (community disputes, raids, accusations)
#     occur but are less frequent than partner violence for an adult woman with low
#     extraversion.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Around age 27 (single event)
#   type: physical_assault
# - event: While returning from her gardens with a heavy bundle, she slipped on a muddy
#     bank near a stream and fell awkwardly, badly spraining or fracturing her ankle;
#     she spent weeks mostly immobile while others brought her food and helped with
#     cooking.
#   reasoning: Field/forest work, cooking fires, river travel, and carrying loads create
#     meaningful accident risk, but most serious morbidity was infectious rather than
#     traumatic.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Around ages 24–25 (single event with weeks-long incapacity)
#   type: serious_accident
# - event: After separating from her husband and spending periods away from his compound,
#     she had a discreet sexual relationship with a man from a nearby settlement who
#     provided small gifts (salt/fish/cloth) and helped her with transport; it remained
#     outside a recognized union.
#   reasoning: Separation/divorce and periods living largely alone raise odds of sex
#     outside the primary union (including new partners before formal remarriage).
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Ages 27–29 (sustained period)
#   type: extramarital_sex
# - event: During the post-separation relationship, she conceived while not in a formally
#     recognized marriage; the pregnancy became a source of gossip and dispute over
#     who would claim paternity and whether any compensation would be owed between kin
#     groups.
#   reasoning: Premarital or post-separation conception is plausible, but her four recorded
#     live births could all have occurred within a recognized union, making this uncertain.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Around age 28 (single pregnancy)
#   type: pregnancy_outside_marriage
# - event: Armed raiders struck settlements along the river corridor, and her household
#     fled into the forest with what they could carry, hiding for days and then returning
#     to find some gardens trampled and food stores taken.
#   reasoning: Raiding and armed conflict could cause flight to kin, temporary displacement,
#     or village insecurity, which is the most common direct warfare pathway for civilians.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Ages 16–17 (sustained period of weeks with displacement)
#   type: civilian_war_exposure
# - event: During the raid, she saw a man from her community (or a nearby village) speared
#     and left to die near the path as people fled; the scene became a lasting reference
#     point in later conversations about the dangers of travel and river crossings.
#   reasoning: During raids, civilians sometimes directly witnessed killings or severe
#     violence, but not every conflict exposure involved close-up atrocities.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 16–17 (single event)
#   type: witnessed_atrocity
---

Nabale was born on August 24, 1639 in a small settlement in the forested river country west of the great bends of the Congo. Authority sat with elders and lineage heads, not distant courts, but news and danger traveled along the water: traders bringing iron goods and cloth, and raiders hunting captives. Her people spoke a local Bantu tongue and kept household rites for ancestors, with offerings set beside the cooking place and at small family shrines.

Her first world was a compound of related households. Her father Mokali came and went with hunters, returning with duiker or bush pig, sometimes with smoked meat wrapped in leaves. Her mother Mangala kept the gardens and the cooking, and made Nabale learn early. As a toddler she carried little bundles of firewood and watched the pounding of cassava and plantain. Kondé, Mokali’s mother, sat near the hearth and corrected the children’s posture and speech. Nabale learned to keep her face still and her hands busy. When she was told to fetch water, she took the same path every time, along the same trees and stones, and grew angry when a cousin tried to send her a different way.

Likomo arrived in 1641 and soon followed Nabale everywhere. Masika came in 1644, then Kalenge in 1646. Nabale’s place as the eldest settled into her shoulders: keep the younger ones quiet, wipe their faces, stop them from wandering near the river. She enjoyed one small thing for herself. In the early morning, before the older women spoke much, she ate warm plantain with a pinch of ash salt and sat on a low stool by the edge of the clearing, listening to birds and the far sound of paddles. It was the part of the day she kept neat.

In 1649 an infant sister, Yalika, lived only a short time. That year the compound sharpened its rules about dirt, food, and contact with outsiders. Mangala placed small portions of beer and mashed food near a family shrine and called the names of dead kin. Nabale watched closely and copied the steps, careful not to forget. She did not ask questions. She repeated what she was shown.

Kondé died in 1655. The older woman’s mat was rolled up and her cooking pot moved away. Mangala took full charge of the children’s work. Nabale became the one who measured cassava and kept the pounding stones from being left out in the rain. She was not quick at planning; she forgot to set aside cuttings for replanting and lost a basket of dried fish to ants. She worked hard after scolding, but the scolding came often.

The river brought other things besides fish. Traders and travelers appeared with strings of beads, cloth, iron blades, and talk from far places. Nabale kept her eyes down when men spoke. She had a sharp dislike for noisy bargaining and the teasing that came with it. Mukali expected her to learn the words of exchange, but she let Likomo talk for her, and Likomo did, chattering until someone laughed.

In 1655 and 1656 insecurity tightened along the river corridor. Nabale was sixteen when armed raiders came. The alarm ran through the settlement as shouting and the crack of breaking wood carried over the water. Mangala shoved a bundle into Nabale’s arms—cassava bread, a gourd, a small wrapped packet that held offerings—and drove the children into the forest. They hid for days with other families, sleeping under leaves and moving at night to avoid paths. During the flight Nabale saw a man from a nearby community stumble on the trail. A raider drove a spear into him and left him where he fell. Nabale did not scream. She pressed Kalenge’s head into her lap and kept her hand over the girl’s mouth until the sounds passed.

When they returned, gardens were trampled and some stores taken. People talked about protective medicines. A ritual specialist named Basile was called more often, and Mangala followed his instructions exactly: small offerings of food, restrictions on who could eat first, careful placement of charms near the sleeping place. Nabale did as she was told and stopped walking alone beyond the nearest gardens.

Marriage came the next year. In 1656, at seventeen, Nabale moved to a nearby settlement to live in Nsala’s compound. The union tied her kin to his, and she carried her mother’s teaching with her: clean fire, steady food, no public quarrels. The new household had its own rhythms and its own older women. Ndumba, a senior woman there, watched Nabale closely and corrected her without softness.

Nabale gave birth to a son, Kasuku, in 1658. He died within days. The men spoke of causes; the women spoke of taboos. Nabale washed cloth, boiled water, and kept quiet. A daughter, Sokela, was born in 1660 and did not live long enough to sit upright. After that, every cough in the compound drew eyes toward Nabale. Nsala listened to Ndumba and began to treat his wife’s tiredness as refusal. If she hesitated at night after a day of planting and pounding, he forced himself on her. This happened repeatedly in 1660 and 1661, and the older women turned away and kept their mouths shut.

Mokali died in 1662, the year Nabale’s third child was born. Bokila lived longer than the first two, long enough to run between cooking huts with a bit of cassava in her fist. Nabale carried her on her hip while she worked. She did not sing much, but she let Bokila bang a wooden spoon on a pot, and for that she smiled. Bokila died in 1664, after a sickness that ran through several children. Basile came again. Offerings of beer and food were placed, and a small charm was tied near the sleeping mat. Ndumba said Nabale had brought misfortune from her mother’s side.

By then Nsala’s anger had become physical. He struck her with his hand and with a switch when he thought she wasted food or spoke too sharply. Arguments over stored cassava and over who had claim to fish turned into beating. Nabale had a short temper in private and did not soften her words when accused. That fed the violence. Once, in 1665, he hit her in front of others after she refused to go to the gardens with a fever. She held her tongue afterward, but she did not forget.

Her fourth child, a son named Tombé, was born in 1665. He died the next year. In 1664 and 1665 Nabale also suffered a serious accident. Carrying a heavy bundle from the gardens, she slipped on a muddy bank by a stream and landed wrong. Her ankle swelled and would not bear weight. For weeks she stayed close to the cooking place, unable to carry loads. That gave Ndumba another reason to call her lazy, and Nsala another reason to strike.

In 1666, after a severe beating, Mangala and Nabale’s sisters came to Nsala’s compound with elders and demanded that Nabale return. The negotiation was hard and full of talk Nabale could not follow. Masika and Likomo spoke for her. Nabale listened, eyes on the ground, and answered only when directly asked. She left with her small belongings and no surviving children.

She did not settle back into the center of her natal compound. Mangala gave her food and a corner of shelter, but gossip clung to her, and Nabale disliked the scrutiny. In 1667 she began sleeping for stretches in a small hut near a riverside landing, attached to people who were not close kin. She cooked for herself when she could and traded small amounts of garden produce.

That year, at the landing, another woman accused Nabale of taking cassava cuttings and food. The dispute turned into violence. Nabale was knocked down and kicked, bruised badly enough that she could not carry a full load for days. She kept away from the landing afterward, but she still needed salt and fish.

In 1668 she entered a discreet relationship with Lomako, a man from a nearby settlement. He brought her small gifts—salt, smoked fish, a strip of cloth—and helped her move goods by canoe. It was not a recognized marriage, and it brought more talk. Nabale cared about the talk only when it threatened her access to gardens and water. She did not charm people into her side; she simply did her work and avoided gatherings.

She became pregnant in 1668 while still outside any formal union. Kin argued over compensation and paternity. Nabale stayed quiet through the dispute, letting others speak. Her body carried the matter regardless of the words.

In 1670 the rains brought heavy mosquitoes and sickness. Nabale fell ill with an acute fever in June. She died on June 25, 1670, at thirty, in the small shelter where she had been living. Her body was washed, wrapped, and buried near the edge of the settlement, and food and a small portion of beer were placed for her ancestors to receive her.
