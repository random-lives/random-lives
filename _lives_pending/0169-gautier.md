Gautier was born on 13 October 869 in a small farming settlement near the Saône, under the authority of West Francia’s Carolingian lords and their local agents. His family called themselves Franks, but in the house and at the village hearth they spoke the local Romance speech. They lived as free smallholders, owing dues but working their own strips and keeping a few animals.

His father, Ragenald, spent the autumn days bringing in grain and stacking sheaves, then checking a small herd and a pig pen before dusk. Adela kept the fire, salted food, minded poultry, and turned flax and wool into thread. Gisla, a widowed grandmother in the house, moved between tasks and children, steady with the newborn and strict about warmth and cleanliness. Two years earlier Adela had borne a daughter, Ermentrude, who died within days; the women in the household spoke her name quietly when labor began.

Gautier came into the world small and quick to chill. On the second day his navel seeped and reddened. Gisla boiled water and washed linen; Adela pressed him to her and tried to feed him often. Ragenald sent a neighbor, Aldric, to fetch the priest. Father Anselm arrived with a small vessel of blessed water and baptized the child in the house, marking his forehead with the sign of the cross.

Gautier died on 17 October. Father Anselm read the prayers over the body, and Ragenald carried him to the churchyard for burial in the consecrated ground.
