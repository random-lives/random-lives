#     sex: M
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 34
#     connection: Occurs during a tight harvest season; increases her suspicion of neighbors
#       and pushes her to hide thread/food more carefully, reinforcing her low agreeableness
#       in disputes.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 42
#     connection: Triggered by poor rice year(s) plus husband’s funeral and rent arrears;

#   - birth_year: 1779
#     death_age: 55
#     death_year: 1834
#     name: Zeng Jinfang
#     narrative_role: Protagonist; diligent, sharp-tongued, steady under pressure, known
#       for textile work and managing scarcity.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: 1782
#     death_age: 17
#     death_year: 1799
#     name: Zeng Yindi
#     narrative_role: Younger sister she helped mind and teach; her adolescent death
#       (fever year) is a second sibling loss that reinforces Jinfang’s sense that life
#       turns suddenly.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds her reputation (major achievement) and helps the household
#       survive crises, but makes her rigid and critical of others’ laziness.
#     scene: Keeps thread bundles counted, ration jars marked by simple signs, and rent
#       grain measured twice; insists on finishing warps even when tired.
#     timing: Most visible ages 20–45 (1799–1824)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (very high)
#   - consequence: Creates household friction and gossip, but also deters some exploitation
#       and makes her a feared negotiator.
#     scene: Confronts a sister-in-law over missing rice and openly challenges a lineage
#       manager’s extra fees, refusing to smile or soften her words.
#     timing: Peaks during mature adulthood and widowhood (ages 30–50; 1809–1829)
#     trait: Agreeableness (very low)
#   - consequence: Others read her steadiness as coldness; it enables sustained work
#       under stress but reduces emotional support from neighbors.
#     scene: During a child’s fever or after bereavement, she does not collapse into
#       panic; she methodically prepares gruel, sends for herbs, and resumes work the
#       next day with a hard calm.
#     timing: After major losses (ages 27–30; 1806–1809) and again during economic crisis
#       (1820–1823)
#     trait: Neuroticism (very low)
#   - consequence: Improves short-term household survival and bargaining position; increases
#       mistrust and fuels village rumors, contributing to 'nonstandard sexual history'
#       vulnerability via gossip dynamics.
#     scene: In rent shortfalls, she bargains aggressively, minimizes reported household
#       stores, and uses sharp talk to shift blame for shortages; she may keep back
#       a small private reserve of thread.
#     timing: Economic crisis and after theft (ages 33–44; 1812–1823)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (low)
#   - consequence: Protects her from risky religious entanglements but may delay trying
#       helpful innovations.
#     scene: Dismisses new devotional fashions or novel remedies, preferring known household
#       rituals and familiar herbal treatments; skeptical of unusual sectarian talk.
#     timing: Across adulthood (ages 20–55; 1799–1834)
#     trait: Openness (low)
#   - consequence: Competent in household management; vulnerable to being outmaneuvered
#       in formal paperwork by clerks/landlord agents.
#     scene: Learns practical numeracy for thread and grain measures and recognizes
#       common characters, but avoids complex written contracts, relying on male kin
#       to read formal documents.
#     timing: Ages 10–40 (1789–1819)
#     trait: Intelligence (below average but normal range)
#   - consequence: Lasting reputation risk, sharper conflicts with in-laws, and increased
#       dependence on strict respectability rituals thereafter.
#     scene: 'Plan for narrative to anchor this in a culturally plausible, ambiguous
#       event: a coerced or exploitative encounter in widowhood (not romanticized),
#       or a relationship rumored as improper while she sought protection/resources
#       during crisis.'
#     timing: Most plausible during widowhood/economic strain (ages 42–45; 1821–1824)
#     trait: Nonstandard sexual history (selected as occurred)
# number_of_children: '3'
# number_of_siblings: '4'
# occupation: Home textile producer (spinning/weaving/sewing) as primary contribution,
#   alongside some farm labor
# religion: Household ancestor veneration + seasonal grave rites (Qingming, festivals)
#   as core practice, with occasional local temple visits to popular deities

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During the autumn harvest, someone slipped into the house-yard at night and
#     stole a small bundle of spun cotton thread and a bit of stored rice from a chest,
#     likely to sell or barter at the next market day.
#   reasoning: Tenant-farming villages experienced routine petty theft and occasional
#     burglary/robbery, but households were relatively small targets and losses might
#     be minor yet still count as victimization.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Age 33–35 (circa 1812–1814); single event
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: After a bad rice year and her husband's funeral expenses, the household fell
#     behind on rent and interest to a local landlord/lineage manager; she had to increase
#     night spinning and pawn clothing/blankets to cover grain rent and fees.
#   reasoning: Tenant households were vulnerable to harvest shocks, rent pressure, and
#     medical/funeral costs; widowhood and the deaths of three children increase the
#     chance of a debt or subsistence crisis at least once.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Age 41–44 (circa 1820–1823); sustained period
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: 'Her weaving and careful household management became locally recognized:
#     the household relied on her cloth production to meet part of the rent, and she
#     was repeatedly asked by neighbors to help set up looms and teach girls basic spinning
#     and weaving techniques.'
#   reasoning: For an ordinary tenant-farming woman with limited literacy, public recognition
#     was rare; achievements were usually private/domestic and not socially 'notable'
#     beyond the village/lineage.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Age 28–36 (circa 1807–1815); recurring pattern
#   type: major_achievement
# - event: She developed recurrent bouts of cough and breathlessness that lingered through
#     winters and limited heavy fieldwork; she shifted more of her labor to seated spinning/weaving
#     and household tasks during flare-ups.
#   reasoning: Ages 30–50 in a high-pathogen environment commonly brought lingering
#     conditions (recurrent fevers, chronic respiratory disease, joint pain/arthritis,
#     pelvic issues) that limited work but did not immediately kill.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 46–55 (circa 1825–1834); sustained period
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: She spent months nursing an elderly mother-in-law with progressive weakness
#     and swelling, preparing thin rice gruel, changing bedding, and arranging visits
#     by a local herbalist/ritual helper when symptoms worsened.
#   reasoning: In a stem household, women commonly nursed ill in-laws/spouses and managed
#     convalescence without formal medical care, making prolonged caregiving a frequent
#     burden.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 49–52 (circa 1828–1831); sustained period
#   type: sick_relative

Zeng Jinfang was born on November 7, 1779, in a hamlet outside Ji’an in Jiangxi, under the Qing empire in the long Qianlong reign. Her people were Han villagers who spoke Gan and measured their year by rent deadlines, rice transplanting, and the festival calendar. The household kept an ancestral tablet shelf above a small table: incense burner, two plain candlesticks, and bowls set out with rice, tea, and a little pork on New Year’s and on the days her grandfather chose.

She arrived as the fourth child in a line that already carried grief. Two older brothers had died in infancy, one in 1775 and the other the same year he was born. The living children in her early years were her older sister, Zeng Xiulan, and later a younger sister, Zeng Yindi. Their father, Zeng Mingyuan, farmed rented plots and kept his eyes on grain measures and the landlord’s clerk. Their mother, Madam Luo, spun and wove in the women’s corner of the house, her hands always busy when her voice went quiet. Jinfang learned early not to wait for comfort. When a child coughed too long, water was boiled, ginger sliced, and an older woman sent to ask after a cheap packet of herbs.

The stem household meant authority sat with the old. Her grandfather, Zeng Guoliang, decided when to buy seed and when to sell a piglet. He tolerated little noise at meals. Jinfang’s grandmother, Madam Qiu, kept the keys to the storage jars and corrected girls’ posture at the loom. Jinfang took correction without tears and repeated the task exactly the next time. She argued back, too, when she thought an order was foolish, and her grandmother slapped the table and told her to swallow her words. Jinfang swallowed them in public and let them out later with her sister in the yard, in a low voice that carried sharp edges.

She started spinning seriously before she was ten. Her mother showed her how to tease cotton, how to keep twist even, how to roll the thread tight so it did not snag. Jinfang watched her mother’s hands and copied without asking many questions. She learned a few characters used in household tallies, enough to tell jars apart when someone marked them and to recognize the character for “rice” on a temple slip. Writing never became part of her work; she counted bundles and remembered numbers instead.

Her grandfather died in 1792, and the house shifted. Men talked longer at night, and the women listened for what that meant for rent and for land. The next years brought more sickness in the village. In 1799 her younger sister Yindi fell ill in late summer and did not recover. Jinfang carried water, cleaned the vomit from the mat, and watched her mother place incense at the ancestor table with steady hands. At the burial, Jinfang stood straight. At home she put her sister’s unused spindle aside and used it the next day.

Marriage negotiations started when she was fifteen. Her father cared about distance and rent terms, not about romance. In 1796, at seventeen, she left her natal village for a nearby one, moving into the Li household and taking a new set of elders. Her husband was Li Shengde, a tenant farmer who carried grain to market when he could and did day labor in slack seasons. The household head was his mother, Madam Deng. Jinfang arrived with bolts of cloth and a chest, and her mother-in-law inspected the stitching and nodded once.

Jinfang's first pregnancy came quickly. Midwife Chen attended the birth in 1798. A son survived, and he was named Li Changshun. The baby's existence changed Jinfang's place in the courtyard. She still rose before daylight to sweep and start the fire, but she spoke more directly to her mother-in-law and did not lower her eyes when corrected. She liked sitting on the doorstep with the baby on her knee while she worked fiber between her fingers; she preferred the early morning, when the yard was cool and the men had not begun to complain about prices.

Her grandmother, Madam Qiu, died in 1801, ten years after her husband. Jinfang had outlived the woman who once slapped the table and told her to swallow her words; she did not weep at the funeral, only stood straight as she had been taught.

A second son, Li Ershun, was also born in 1801 and died at two in 1803, during a season when children in neighboring houses also had loose stools and fever. Jinfang washed the cloths in cold water and did not stop to wail. She boiled rice into thin gruel, fed him with a spoon, and sent a child to fetch herbs. When he died, she supervised the packing of his small clothing bundle and corrected her husband when he tied it wrong.

Her third son, Li Sanshun, arrived in 1804. By then Jinfang moved through her tasks with a strict rhythm. She measured thread by armspan and tied knots at the same count each time. In 1806, when her eldest boy Changshun was eight, he fell sick and died after a short struggle. News reached her that same year that her older sister Xiulan had died back in her natal village. Jinfang traveled home for the rites and watched her father’s face tighten as he spoke to lineage elders. She offered paper money at Xiulan’s grave and went back to the Li household without lingering. In 1808 her youngest, Sanshun, died at four after repeated bouts of cough and diarrhea. After that the courtyard women’s talk grew pointed. Jinfang answered bluntly when pressed and ended conversations by returning to the loom.

From 1807 into the next decade, cloth became the work that steadied the household. Jinfang’s thread was even and strong, and she set up looms quickly. Auntie Sun from the next lane came to borrow a reed and stayed to watch Jinfang adjust the heddles. Jinfang did not offer much warmth, but she explained methods clearly and did not waste time. Girls were brought to her to learn to spin without snapping thread. She told them to sit upright, keep the twist steady, and stop blaming humidity for careless fingers. She enjoyed a bowl of hot sweet potato in winter and the first new tea in spring, drunk alone before anyone else rose. When she laughed, it was short and sudden, usually at a neighbor’s story about a pompous rent clerk slipping in mud.

The broader world pressed in through taxes, rent, and price shifts. Cash grew tighter in the Jiaqing years, and copper coins felt scarce in market days. Flood and drought years in the Yangzi region showed up as higher rice prices and sharper demands from managers. Jinfang kept small reserves of thread hidden under a mat and wrapped the best cloth in oil paper.

In the autumn of 1813, during harvest, someone entered the house-yard at night and stole a bundle of spun cotton thread and a little stored rice from a chest. Jinfang found the latch lifted in the morning and counted what was missing without shouting. She walked to Auntie Sun’s door and demanded to know who had been prowling. Sun denied knowledge. Jinfang replied that liars always denied, then returned home and barred the chest with a rope and a wedge. After that, she slept lighter and checked corners before dawn.

Her father, Zeng Mingyuan, died in 1818. The funeral in her natal village was plain. She burned incense, bowed, and listened to her brothers-in-law argue about rent before the body was cold. She returned to the Li household with less to fall back on.

Li Shengde died in 1821. The funeral costs hit hard, and the next years brought a bad rice year and rent pressure. By 1822 the household owed arrears to Steward Huang, the landlord’s manager. Jinfang pawned bedding and extra clothing, and she spun late into the night with a small oil lamp, turning her face away from smoke. When Huang demanded additional fees, she met him at the gate and corrected his numbers in front of witnesses, using pebbles on the ground to count. Huang raised his voice. Jinfang raised hers higher, without trembling.

That same period brought the private trouble she never named aloud. In widowhood, with rent overdue and men coming and going for negotiations, a man from outside the household forced himself on her in a storage room one evening when others were at the fields. She washed afterward, replaced the jar he had knocked aside, and said nothing. Later, when gossip started from a servant girl who had seen him leaving, Jinfang confronted the girl and threatened to report her to the baojia head. The talk quieted. Jinfang increased offerings at the ancestor table that New Year: pork slices, rice wine, paper money folded into ingots. She did not remarry.

In 1825 she developed a winter cough that returned each cold season, with breathlessness that made carrying water uphill slow. She shifted to seated work, spinning and mending, and left heavier field tasks to others. In 1826 her mother, Madam Luo, died in her natal village. Jinfang traveled for the rites and returned with a small bundle of her mother’s tools: a worn spindle and a needle case.

From 1828 into 1831, her mother-in-law Madam Deng declined with weakness and swelling. Jinfang prepared thin rice gruel, changed bedding, and rubbed the old woman’s legs with warmed oil. When Deng’s breathing grew rough, Jinfang sent for Ritual Master Peng, who recited and burned talismans, and for an herbalist who left bitter packets to boil. Deng complained, and Jinfang answered with clipped patience. She did the work anyway.

On December 4, 1834, at fifty-five, Jinfang collapsed in the courtyard after speaking to a sister-in-law about grain measures. One side of her body went slack, and her speech turned thick. The household laid her on a mat and sent for help, but her mind did not return and she died that day. The women of her husband's household washed her body, dressed her in plain clean clothes, and placed her in a coffin; incense and paper money were burned before the ancestor table, and she was buried in the family plot with food set out for her spirit.
