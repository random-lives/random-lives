#     narrative_role: Primary caregiver and household subsistence worker (millet processing,

#       him during illness using both practical care and calling in ritual help.
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Pala
#     narrative_role: 'Key support in a mother-centered household: takes Kanu when Ena
#       must work, knows older remedies, and participates in/hosts spirit-negotiation
#       rites when the child is sick or frightened.'
#     role: maternal grandmother (co-resident or frequent visitor)
#   - death_year: -1496
#     name: Daro
#     narrative_role: Not a resident figure. Treated as deceased by the household by
#       the time Kanu is a toddler (spoken of rarely; absence shapes the household’s
#       reliance on maternal kin and the older sisters’ labor).
#     role: father (absent/deceased/unknown)
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Tuma
#     narrative_role: Called during bouts of fever and breathing trouble; leads drumming/chanting
#       and ‘soul-calling’ style rites while women of the household offer food/smoke/cloth
#       at the edge of the dwelling.
#     role: ritual specialist / shamanic medium (non-kin, occasional)
#   developmental_moments:
#   - age: about 2 years, 6 months
#     detail: Kanu prefers staying close to Ena and Pala rather than running toward
#       other children. While millet is being winnowed or ground, he repeatedly brings
#       back the same small scoop or a smooth pebble to ‘help,’ placing it carefully
#       beside the work. If someone moves it, he becomes upset and tries to put it back
#       exactly where it was.
#     moment: Quiet ‘helper’ routine at the grain work area
#   - age: about 3 years, late winter/early spring
#     detail: On a bitter day when wind pushes smoke back into the room, Kanu startles
#       at the sudden roar of the fire and begins to whimper. He retreats to Pala’s
#       legs, hides his face, then peeks out to watch the older sister Sali gently shoo
#       him away from the hearth. This becomes a small family joke—he is ‘the one who
#       watches from behind the skirt’—but it also shows how easily he is spooked.
#     moment: Winter fear and clinging at the doorway
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Beku
#     prominence: minor
#     relationship: neighbor child (playmate seen occasionally)
#   - name: Uli

#   personality_manifestations:
#   - behavior: Stays near one trusted adult; watches other children rather than joining;
#       speaks softly or uses gestures instead of calling out.
#     trait: Low Extraversion (11th percentile)
#   - behavior: Startles easily at loud sounds (dogs barking, crackling fire); quick
#       to cry when separated; hard to soothe when overtired or sick.
#     trait: High Neuroticism (85th percentile)
#   - behavior: Wary of unfamiliar visitors and new objects; prefers the same corner
#       of the dwelling and the same small items; resists being carried to unfamiliar
#       nearby houses.
#     trait: Low Openness (24th percentile)
#   - behavior: Likes routines (same sleeping spot, same cup); becomes distressed if
#       familiar items are moved; imitates ‘tidying’ by stacking or placing objects
#       in a fixed place.
#     trait: High Conscientiousness (81st percentile)
#   - behavior: Less grabbing and showing-off; when corrected he tends to stop rather
#       than escalate, though he may cry from frustration.
#     trait: High Honesty-Humility (90th percentile) / modest dominance
#   - behavior: Learns household words quickly (for water, fire, mother, sister); follows

Kanu was born in midwinter into a small farming hamlet on the river plains of what is now the Heilongjiang region, part of the Liao River–Liaodong Bronze Age world. Power sat close to the ground: elders, family ties, and a few men with weapons and followers. People spoke a local Transeurasian-associated tongue and called on spirits through drumming and shouted prayers when illness or fear struck.

His mother, Ena, ran a commoner household without a resident husband. The name of Kanu’s father, Daro, was spoken as a dead man by the time Kanu could understand words. Ena’s mother, Pala, slept near the hearth and kept the youngest close while Ena worked. Kanu's sisters were much older. Mina, his eldest sister, hauled water and tended the little animals at the edge of the dwelling. Sali, closer in age to Kanu, watched him when Ena went to the fields or to gather wood.

At two and a half, Kanu stayed underfoot rather than running after the neighbor child, Beku. He liked the grain work area. When Ena winnowed and Pala ground millet, he carried the same small scoop back and forth and set it down beside the mat, placing it carefully in one spot. If Mina shifted it with her foot, he cried and put it back, then sat quiet with his hands on his knees.

Late in his third winter, wind shoved smoke back into the room. The hearth flared and popped. Kanu jerked, whined, and pressed into Pala’s legs, then peeked out while Sali pulled him away from the fire and pushed the dog, Uli, toward the doorway.

In early summer, after days of coughing and fast breathing, Ena called Tuma, a medium, who beat a drum and shouted for Kanu’s soul to return while Pala set millet cakes and a cup of broth near the threshold. Kanu died before the next dawn.

They wrapped him in a cloth and laid him in a small pit at the edge of the settlement, with a little food and his smooth pebble placed by his hand.
