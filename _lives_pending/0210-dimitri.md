#     name: Ana
#     narrative_role: Youngest daughter; small child when Dimitri dies; later becomes
#       the main living link to his memory within the kin network.
#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 29
#     connection: Occurs soon after the broader political instability years (809+) and
#       during the period when he has two young surviving daughters; forces the joint
#       household to alter migration timing and sell animals, which later makes them
#       more vulnerable on routes.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 30
#     connection: 'Second year effects: debt obligations and reduced breeding stock
#       keep them poor; Dimitri takes longer, riskier grazing circuits to rebuild numbers.'
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 31
#     connection: 'Third year: slow herd recovery; increased reliance on kin reciprocity
#       and church/alms expectations during feasts.'
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 34
#     connection: Happens on a customary passage/drive route when the household is still
#       rebuilding after losses; his extraversion leads him to engage and argue rather
#       than flee, escalating the beating.
#     incident: physical_assault
#   - age: 33
#     connection: Begins when his father’s stiffness becomes disabling and his mother
#       can’t manage winter tasks; ties to joint household logistics (who stays near
#       winter quarters, who moves with the flock).
#     incident: elderly_parents
#   - age: 37
#     connection: Peaks as Dimitri is both a working herder and a practical caregiver;
#       stress is physical rather than emotional (low neuroticism), leading to overexertion
#       and shortcuts.
#     incident: elderly_parents
#   life_phases:

#       and church rites.
#     - Takes on longer herding stints; learns routes, water points, and negotiation
#       with neighboring groups despite being illiterate.
#     phase: Later childhood / adolescence
#   - age_range: 17-28
#     key_events:
#     - Marriage to Elene (802) and formation of his own conjugal unit within a joint
#       family setting.
#     - 'Migration within the wider frontier world (c. 802-805): the fraternal group
#       relocates pasture circuits/settlement area, likely following kin ties and grazing
#       opportunity.'
#     - Two neonatal deaths (804, 806) followed by the birth of Salome (808); sister
#       Eka dies (806) and later sister Marta (811), tightening family labor and grief
#       cycles.
#     phase: Young adulthood
#   - age_range: 29-38
#     key_events:
#     - 'Severe economic crisis (809-812): winter loss and livestock sickness; selling
#       breeding stock and borrowing grain; slow recovery.'
#     - Father’s decline and mother’s frailty increase elder-care obligations (813-819),
#       with Dimitri and Elene taking daily responsibility.
#     - Physical assault during a seasonal move (814), leaving chronic pain; continues
#       herding until fatal accident/trauma in 819.

#       after his death.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds useful connections and information flow, but also draws him
#       into confrontations and makes him more exposed to risky social situations (e.g.,
#       the assault).
#     scene: At seasonal gatherings and markets he is the one who speaks first, jokes
#       with strangers, and negotiates grazing access; on the trail he talks loudly
#       to keep the group coordinated and spirits up.
#     timing: Adolescence through mature adulthood (ages 12-38)
#     trait: Extraversion (77th percentile)
#   - consequence: Resilience helps household functioning, but he may under-prepare
#       for hazards (weather, bandits) and dismiss others’ worries.
#     scene: After infant deaths and later after the beating, he returns quickly to
#       routine tasks, focusing on what can be done today rather than ruminating; he
#       prays and then acts.
#     timing: Young adulthood and mature adulthood (ages 24-38)
#     trait: Low neuroticism (13th percentile)
#   - consequence: Contributes to near-misses and tension with more meticulous kin;
#       increases accident exposure in a dangerous environment.
#     scene: He occasionally delays repairs to tack/fencing, forgets small obligations,
#       or pushes a little too late into bad weather to reach pasture, relying on improvisation.
#     timing: Mature adulthood (ages 29-38), especially during/after the economic crisis
#     trait: Lower conscientiousness (38th percentile)
#   - consequence: Limits upward mobility and increases vulnerability in disputes with
#       officials/traders, but does not prevent competent pastoral work.
#     scene: He learns best by imitation and repeated routine rather than abstract planning;
#       he struggles with complex bargaining or remembering intricate dues, relying
#       on a brother/cousin for details while he excels at physical herding skill.
#     timing: Adolescence onward (ages 10-38)
#     trait: Lower intelligence (16th percentile) without clear disorder
#   - consequence: Facilitates the family’s move and adaptation, but can put him on
#       less-secure routes.
#     scene: He is more willing than many peers to try a new pasture circuit, adopt
#       a different tool/rope method, or listen to travelers’ stories and advice.
#     timing: Young adulthood (ages 20-30), especially around migration
#     trait: Moderately higher openness (64th percentile)
# number_of_children: '4'
# number_of_siblings: 10+
# occupation: Transhumant pastoralist (sheep/goat herder; seasonal movement between
#   pastures; some dairy/wool production)
# religion: Georgian Chalcedonian Christian practice (household prayers, sign of the
#   cross, icons/crosses; feast days; occasional church/monastery attendance; baptisms/marriage/funerals

# structured_incidents:
# - event: A harsh winter followed by livestock sickness cut the household’s sheep and
#     goats badly, forcing his fraternal household to borrow grain and sell breeding
#     animals to pay dues and get through the next season, leaving them poor for several
#     years.
#   reasoning: Herd loss from winter kill, disease, or raiding could abruptly impoverish
#     a household; however, joint fraternal co-residence and ordinary standing suggest
#     some buffering against total destitution.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 29–32
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: While moving the flock along a customary route, he was set upon by armed
#     men (likely raiders or bandits) and beaten in a struggle over animals and provisions;
#     he survived but carried lingering pain afterward.
#   reasoning: As a frontier transhumant pastoralist, he had substantial exposure to
#     raids, bandits, and interpersonal fights, making non-domestic assault the most
#     likely violence subtype.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 34
#   type: physical_assault
# - event: As his father became stiff and weak and his mother increasingly unable to
#     do winter tasks, he and his wife took on the daily burden of feeding them, keeping
#     them warm, and managing their needs during seasonal moves and the long cold season.
#   reasoning: His parents could plausibly still be alive during his adulthood, and
#     co-resident joint-family arrangements often placed substantial elder care on adult
#     sons and their wives, though not always as the 'primary' caregiver.

Dimitri was born on May 23, 780, in a high, cold grassland of the Erzurum plateau where authority shifted between Byzantine commanders and the forces that raided from the Abbasid side. His household spoke only a Kartvelian tongue and followed the Georgian Chalcedonian church. A cross hung where the family slept, and his mother Nana began each morning by crossing herself and murmuring the short prayers she knew, then setting milk to warm and checking the churn.

He entered a crowded home. His father Vakhtang kept sheep and goats and moved them between seasonal pasture and winter shelter. Vakhtang’s parents still lived and ruled the household’s rhythm. Dimitri’s paternal grandfather, Giorgi, decided when to move camp and which ridges belonged to them by right. His grandmother Mariam managed stores, judged quarrels among children, and pulled Dimitri by the ear when he darted too close to a ram. Dimitri grew with older sisters—Mariam, Ketevan, and Nino—who braided his hair for church days and laughed when he tried to sing the responses without knowing the words. His older brother Giorgi carried the heavier burdens and walked beside their father when men talked business.

By six, Dimitri followed the animals for short stretches, a stick in his hand, calling out loud to keep the flock together. He liked being where voices carried—at the edge of a market crowd, at the water point where other herders stopped, at the small gatherings after church when men traded news. He learned routes by repetition. He did not learn letters at all. When priests read from books, he watched their hands and the movement of lips and waited for the parts that everyone knew by heart.

In 790, his grandfather died after a winter of stiffness and chest trouble. The men washed the body, wrapped it, and carried it to the churchyard near the small stone church that served several scattered settlements. The priest, Father Mikheil, swung incense and spoke the prayers; Dimitri stared at the thurible and the soot on its chain. After the burial Vakhtang stopped asking permission for every move. He began negotiating himself, with sharper arguments, and he expected Giorgi and then Dimitri to stand beside him and listen.

When Dimitri was fourteen, his sister Ketevan died at eighteen. She had been quick with jokes and sharper still with teasing, and Dimitri had learned to answer her without sulking. Her death brought the household into the discipline of mourning: no singing, less talk, a sober meal after the burial. Dimitri returned to the flock the next morning, loud again, but he took the long way to the pasture so he would not pass the place where she used to sit and spin.

The household shrank again in 798 when his grandmother died. Without her, Nana’s work doubled. Dimitri’s younger sisters—Salome, Eka, Tamar, Marta, and Ana—filled the house with noise, and Nana kept order with short commands and quick slaps. Dimitri took slaps too when he cut corners: leaving a gate unlatched, forgetting to bring back a bucket, wandering off to talk while lambs strayed. He laughed easily and then did the task, but he did not remember the lesson the next time.

His older brother Giorgi should have been the anchor for the next generation. Instead, Giorgi died in 799 at twenty-five, after a sudden fever that took him within days. Vakhtang said little afterward, but he drove the animals harder and demanded silence at meals. Dimitri became one of the men sooner than he expected. He learned to watch for wolves and for people. Bandits and raiders moved through those ridges in some seasons, and men returned from markets with stories of theft and beatings.

Dimitri married Elene in 802. She entered the joint household with the confidence of someone used to work: she could milk fast, cut curds cleanly, and keep a fire alive in wind. Their marriage was not private. Brothers, sisters, parents, and in-laws shared a compound and argued over the same stores. Dimitri liked an audience. Elene did not. She corrected him in a low voice when he joked too freely with strangers.

The family shifted its grazing circuits in 803, leaving the valley that had held the graves of Dimitri’s grandparents and settling among kin farther west along the frontier routes. Dimitri enjoyed the movement: new water points, new neighbors, different ways of tying packs. He spoke first when others hesitated, and he offered help loudly. He also misjudged distances and once pushed the flock too far late in the day, bringing them into camp with animals limping and men cursing.

Elene bore a daughter in 804. The infant lived only a few hours. Father Mikheil was sent for and came in haste; he performed the baptism quickly and spoke the prayers over the tiny body. Dimitri dug in frozen ground with a borrowed iron spade until his palms bled. Two years later, in 806, another daughter died at birth. That same year his sister Eka died at twenty after a short illness, and Nana sat silent at the hearth with her hands in her lap, staring at the churn.

A living child finally came in 808. They named her Salome. Dimitri treated her like a helper from the first year she could walk, putting a handful of salt in her palm to scatter for the animals and letting her carry a small skin of water. He enjoyed showing her off at gatherings, holding her up so relatives could see her face. When she fell and scraped her knee, he laughed and said she would walk it off. Elene scolded him, then tended the wound with warm water and cloth.

Hard years followed. In 809 a brutal winter hit the plateau. Snow stayed late and crusted hard. Animals weakened, and then sickness ran through the remaining flock. Dimitri and his brothers counted dead goats each morning and dragged them away from camp. To meet dues and keep seed grain, they borrowed from neighbors and from the trader Ashot, who demanded payment in good wool and breeding stock. Dimitri hated the bargaining and forgot numbers, forcing Zurab—his younger cousin and co-herder—to step in and recite what they owed. Dimitri made up for it by taking longer days on the hills, searching for forage and guarding the reduced herd with a club across his knees.

Their youngest daughter, Ana, was born in 812 and lived. Dimitri carried her outside on clear mornings and held her toward the light, then crossed himself and muttered the same prayers his mother used. He liked hot bread dipped in salty cheese and ate it standing, watching the flock mill around the camp. He argued quickly when other men questioned their right to a spring. He did not stay angry long, but he did not back down either.

From 813 onward, elder care became a daily burden. Vakhtang’s joints stiffened until he could not mount a horse without help. Nana’s breath shortened in winter, and her hands shook when she tried to spin. Dimitri and Elene fed them first on cold mornings, bringing bowls of porridge and warmed milk, tucking extra cloth around their shoulders. When the household moved to summer pasture, Dimitri stayed back with an older brother one year to manage the slower travel of the elders, then rushed to catch up with the flock.

At thirty-four, in 814, Dimitri drove animals along a customary route and met armed men who demanded provisions and a share of the herd. He shouted back instead of yielding. The men knocked him down with a staff and kicked him until he stopped moving. Zurab pulled him away once the attackers grabbed what they wanted and left. Dimitri returned to camp with bruises darkening his ribs and a swollen jaw. He would not rest. He kept working, but he walked stiffly afterward and woke at night to shift his side away from pain.

Vakhtang died in 817. Dimitri helped wash the body and led the carrying with his brothers, his voice loud in the chants he knew. The next winter Nana needed constant help. Dimitri built up the hearth stones and carried extra fuel into the house. Elene did most of the intimate care, but Dimitri took the heavier loads: lifting, carrying, fetching water through snow.

On April 30, 819, Dimitri died in an accident on the spring move. He slipped on a wet slope while driving goats above a ravine, fell hard, and struck his head on stone. His kin brought his body down on a cloak stretched between poles and took him to the churchyard; Father Mikheil prayed over him, and they buried him wrapped in cloth with a small wooden cross set at the head.
