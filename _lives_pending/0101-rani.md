Rani was born into a small foraging band in the Los Angeles Basin, in a camp that shifted with water, seeds, and game. Her people spoke a local tongue that left no descendants with names outsiders could trace. Spirits were part of practical work: Kuna, the band’s curing specialist, used song, smoke, and touch to pull sickness away and to set luck on a hunt.

Kaya had already buried a daughter, Tala, years earlier. When Rani arrived, Kaya kept her close against her chest in a sling of twisted plant fiber while she dug edible roots with a pointed stick and sorted seeds on a flat stone. Noma brought back rabbits and sometimes deer, carrying the hide and meat to the hearth area and feeding the fire with dry brush from the slopes.

As Rani grew from a newborn into a heavier infant, Kaya stayed near the cleanest seep and boiled what she could in a pitch-lined basket with hot stones. Near the end of the rainy season, several children in camp passed loose stool. Rani's bowels ran watery; her mouth dried; she cried without milk settling her.

Kuna came to Kaya’s hearth, shook a rattle of dried pods, and brushed Rani with sage, then placed a small offering of ground seed and shell beads near a rock at the edge of camp. Rani died in her mother’s arms before the spring grasses browned.

Kaya and Noma wrapped her in soft hide and set her in a shallow grave on a low rise above the seep, with a pinch of seeds and one small bead.
