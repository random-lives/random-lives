#     incident: religious_change
#   - age: 26
#     connection: Air raids in 1940–42 heighten baseline anxiety; contributes to drinking
#       as self-medication and to a harsher, more suspicious temperament.
#     incident: civilian_war_exposure
#   - age: 27
#     connection: Call-up in 1941-ish after early war years; routine NCO responsibilities

#     incident: military_service
#   - age: 34
#     connection: Postwar drinking peaks amid job pressure and marital conflict; assault
#       occurs outside a pub and becomes a family ‘don’t talk about it’ episode that
#       worsens his standing and self-image.
#     incident: physical_assault_perp
#   - age: 52
#     connection: COPD/chronic bronchitis develops after decades of smoking and industrial
#       exposure; limits work and accelerates downward mobility, leading to dependence

#       of job loss and short-term work.
#     phase: 'Midlife: marriage, work, and downward drift'
#   - age_range: 61-75
#     key_events:
#     - Deindustrialization/containerization in Merseyside shrinks opportunities for
#       older manual workers; longer unemployment spells and reliance on benefits/family.
#     - 1970s–80s economic shocks amplify insecurity; pride conflicts with need for
#       help.
#     - Increasing health limitations; more time at home, more solitary routines, periodic
#       attempts to cut down drinking.
#     phase: 'Later adulthood: deindustrialization and family strain'
#   - age_range: 76-86
#     key_events:

#   - birth_year: 1917
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 1917
#     name: Brigid Keegan
#     narrative_role: Infant sister who died young; her absence becomes part of family
#       lore and a source of protective anxiety in the household around later babies.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: 1919
#     death_age: 78
#     death_year: 1997
#     name: Eileen Keegan
#     narrative_role: Younger sister; the one Arthur feels responsible for when young.
#       In adulthood she is blunt about his drinking, and later helps arrange practical
#       care when his health fails.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Employers trust him with responsibility, but rigidity causes friction
#       with coworkers and family; when health fails, the loss of competence feels humiliating
#       and fuels drinking.
#     scene: As a young engineer he keeps meticulous tools and notes, turns up early,
#       and insists jobs be done to spec; at home he fixates on bills, schedules, and
#       small household rules.
#     timing: adolescence through midlife (c. 1930–1970)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (very high)
#   - consequence: Limits criminality and sometimes costs the family small advantages;
#       also makes him harshly self-critical when he acts badly while drunk.
#     scene: Refuses ‘little perks’ at work and won’t fiddle time sheets; dislikes boastful
#       men in the pub and shuts down talk of scams even when money is tight.
#     timing: early adulthood onward
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (very high)
#   - consequence: Few close friends and limited support network; marriage and family
#       become his main social world, increasing pressure on household relationships.
#     scene: Keeps to the edge of gatherings, speaks little, prefers solitary walks
#       or tinkering; in the pub he drinks without much conversation until provoked.
#     timing: childhood onward
#     trait: Extraversion (very low)
#   - consequence: Workplace conflicts and strained marriage; increases likelihood of
#       the pub-fight assault and of being ‘managed’ by relatives later.
#     scene: Blunt, easily annoyed, quick to take offence; arguments escalate fast,
#       especially when he feels disrespected by foremen, officials, or family members.
#     timing: early adulthood through late life
#     trait: Agreeableness (very low)
#   - consequence: Reinforces drinking as relief, contributes to irritability, and makes
#       health symptoms feel overwhelming.
#     scene: Persistent worry about money and health; restless nights during air raids
#       and later during breathing trouble; catastrophizes setbacks.
#     timing: wartime through old age (c. 1940–2000)
#     trait: Neuroticism (moderately high)
#   - consequence: Supports religious change and occasional clashes with traditional
#       family expectations; provides moments of insight and self-awareness.
#     scene: Reads newspapers/books beyond his class expectations (politics, technical
#       manuals, history) and holds private, skeptical views about church and authority.
#     timing: late adolescence onward
#     trait: Openness (high)
#   - consequence: Assault incident, job instability, financial crises, and long-term
#       strain on wife and daughters; worsens chronic respiratory and cardiac risk.
#     scene: Pattern of evening pub drinking that escalates after wartime, with binges
#       on paydays; periods of promises to cut down followed by relapse, and drinking
#       used to blunt anxiety and shame.
#     timing: ages ~25–70 (c. 1939–1984), with residual problems thereafter
#     trait: Alcohol use disorder (mild to severe)
#   - consequence: Creates a sense of ‘wasted potential’ and bitterness; family recognizes
#       his capability even when life goes off-track.
#     scene: Learns technical processes quickly, troubleshoots machinery, and can argue
#       policy points from the paper—yet doesn’t translate it into upward mobility due
#       to temperament, health, and drink.
#     timing: schooling through working life
#     trait: Intelligence (above average)
# number_of_children: '5'
# number_of_siblings: '5'
# occupation: Skilled or semi-skilled manufacturing/engineering worker (plants, workshops,
#   ship-repair)
# religion: 'Nonreligious/secular: no services, no prayer/ritual, may mark holidays
#   in non-church ways'

# structured_incidents:
# - event: Raised around Irish Catholic family expectations in the Liverpool area, he
#     stopped attending Mass in early adulthood and came to treat religion as something
#     for weddings and funerals rather than daily life, eventually identifying as not
#     religious at all.
#   reasoning: He was Irish-descended in a region where Catholic identity was common
#     but is described as nonreligious; moving from a Catholic upbringing to secular
#     practice is a significant shift for this cohort.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 18–30 (c. 1932–1944), solidified by the late 1940s
#   type: religious_change
# - event: After drinking, he got into a serious fight with another man outside a local
#     pub in north Liverpool/Sefton, throwing punches and leaving the other man bloodied;
#     it was treated locally as a "pub scrap" rather than something that became a major
#     court case.
#   reasoning: Given the confirmed perpetrator violence plus alcohol use disorder and
#     low agreeableness, a non-lethal assault (bar fight, domestic assault, workplace
#     fight) is the most likely subtype.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 28–40 (c. 1942–1954)
#   type: physical_assault_perp
# - event: He developed long-term breathlessness and a persistent smoker’s cough consistent
#     with chronic bronchitis/COPD, which increasingly limited his stamina for manual
#     engineering work and contributed to periods of unemployment and dependence on
#     family support.
#   reasoning: Living to 86 with urban/working-life exposures and alcohol misuse makes
#     at least one chronic limiting condition (e.g., chronic bronchitis/COPD, angina,
#     hypertension, diabetes) very likely.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: onset ages 45–60 (c. 1959–1974), ongoing through old age
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: He was called up during the Second World War and served for a period in a
#     non-commissioned role, doing routine duties and training rather than a long-term
#     career, before returning to civilian work in Merseyside afterward.
#   reasoning: Born 1914 in the UK, he was of prime age for WWII conscription; most
#     men of this cohort had some form of service unless reserved, medically unfit,
#     or in essential work.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 25–32 (c. 1939–1946)
#   type: military_service
# - event: He and his family experienced the Merseyside Blitz—night air raids, time
#     spent in shelters, and damage/disruption in the Liverpool area—shaping daily life
#     with fear, shortages, and constant readiness for alarms.
#   reasoning: Merseyside (Liverpool area) experienced heavy bombing and wartime disruption;
#     even without enlistment, significant civilian exposure (air raids, damage, evacuation
#     of family) was common.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 26–28 (c. 1940–1942)
#   type: civilian_war_exposure

Arthur Bernard Keegan was born on 11 April 1914 in Waterloo near Crosby, on the north edge of Liverpool. The area sat under the British state and its schools and courts; his family spoke English and carried Irish Catholic family habits, with parish life as an expectation rather than a choice. His father, Bernard Keegan, worked where the port and the rail lines fed the city, taking shifts that started before daylight and ended late.

The house held more people than its rooms. Nora Keegan kept it running with washing, cooking, and mending; the coal scuttle and the kettle never seemed to be in the wrong place. Nora’s widowed mother, Ellen Sullivan, lived with them and counted out the pennies for bread and dripping. Ellen set the tone. She had a plain rosary, a small crucifix above the bed, and rules about silence when she said her prayers. Arthur grew up watching hands: Ellen’s hands tightening a knot in an apron string, his mother’s hands rubbing soap into collars, his father’s hands blackened from work.

He was the third of six children. Seán, born in 1911, acted older than his years and took responsibility without asking. Mary, born in 1913, learned early to smooth over fights. Patrick came next in 1915, close enough in age to Arthur to be both companion and rival. An infant sister, Brigid, was born in 1917 and died the same year; for years afterward, every cough in the house drew sharp attention. Eileen, the youngest, arrived in 1919 and stayed attached to Arthur’s heels when they were small.

When influenza swept through Britain after the First World War, it reached their streets and schoolrooms. Arthur watched neighbors’ blinds stay drawn in daylight and heard the way adults lowered their voices. Ellen made everyone wash their hands before meals and complained if anyone lingered at a doorstep. Arthur learned to keep his head down and his things in order. He lined up his schoolbooks and hated anyone touching them.

As a boy he went to Catholic school, where priests and teachers expected the boys to serve and the girls to keep quiet. Ellen pushed him toward the parish routine: Sunday Mass, confession before Easter, and a stiff collar that scratched his neck. Arthur did what he was told, but he asked questions in a way that sounded like argument. At home, if a hymn came on from a neighbor’s wireless, he would turn it down and mutter that it was noise. Seán laughed at that once and Arthur glared at him until Mary changed the subject.

By the time Arthur was in his teens, unemployment and cuts hit the Liverpool region hard. Men queued for work at the docks; talk of money filled kitchens as much as talk of weather. Bernard still brought wages home, but the pressure showed in the way he drank when he could afford it and in the way he snapped at small mistakes. Arthur kept his own habits: early breakfast, boots brushed, tools cleaned after any odd job. He did well enough at school to be steered toward a technical track, and he started work connected to engineering—workshops and plant maintenance where men valued a steady hand and an eye for what was out of place.

Ellen Sullivan died in 1933. The house became looser without her watching, and Arthur took that as freedom. The break came openly the next year. After one Sunday argument about attending Mass, he walked out in his work clothes and went to the river frontage instead, watching ships move in the distance and reading a newspaper he’d bought with his own money. He stopped going regularly after that. Nora tried to pull him back with quiet pressure—“your father expects it”—but Arthur treated church as a family obligation for others.

War came again when he was twenty-five. Liverpool turned into a place of uniforms, ration books, and blackouts. Arthur’s nights changed in 1940 when the bombing began in earnest. He learned the sound of the siren and how quickly a street could go from ordinary to smoke and broken glass. He helped carry buckets of water, moved furniture away from windows, and spent hours in shelters with neighbors who talked too loudly to hide their fear. His temper shortened. He slept badly and came to work keyed up, then dulled himself at night with pints.

He was called up in 1941 and put into regular service. The Army took his habit of order and used it. He kept his kit squared away and learned routines fast. A sergeant named Harold Price leaned on him for inspections and for getting other men to do what they were told. Arthur took a non-commissioned role without enjoying it; he hated chatter, hated being challenged, and wrote down everything that mattered because he didn’t trust memory. When he was on leave in Merseyside, he could not relax. The city still carried the marks of raids, and he drank hard with old acquaintances because that was what men did.

Demobilization brought him back to Merseyside and to civilian work. In 1946 he met Margaret “Maggie” Doyle at a dance hall where Mary had insisted he show his face. Arthur barely spoke to Maggie at first, standing at the edge and watching, but Maggie approached him with direct questions. They married and set up a home that ran on her steadiness. He kept his wages in a tin in a drawer and counted out coins for rent and food. He enjoyed a plate of fried bread and eggs early on a Sunday, and he liked sitting near the back window with the paper folded to the sports results and the political column. He repaired small things instead of replacing them: a loose hinge, a fraying plug, a tap washer.

Their first daughter, Kathleen, was born in 1948. Nora followed in 1950. Arthur held the babies awkwardly at first, then became strict about routine—feeds at a set time, beds made a certain way. Maggie fought him on that, and Arthur answered sharply. He didn't gamble and he wouldn't take what he hadn't earned. If a man at work suggested "borrowing" materials, Arthur shut it down and walked away.

The fight that followed him for years happened in 1948, when he was thirty-four. He had been drinking with Tommy Rourke, a workmate from the shop. Outside a pub in north Liverpool, another man bumped him, words were exchanged, and Arthur swung. He kept swinging even after the man went down. The injured man walked away bleeding and shaken, and the incident stayed mostly at the level of talk and warning; Arthur learned which pubs to avoid afterward. Maggie heard about it through Mary and refused to discuss it in front of the children. In private she told him she wouldn't raise daughters in a house where he brought that home. Arthur promised to stop, then returned to the same pattern.

The third baby, Brigid, was born in 1953 and died that same year. Maggie turned inward. Arthur went to the pub more often, staying late, coming home with his breath sour and his patience thin. In 1956 their daughter Eileen was born, and the household tightened itself into function again. Bernard Keegan died in 1956 as well. Arthur spoke little at the funeral and drank afterward until he grew loud, then angry.

Their youngest daughter, Margaret "Rita," arrived in 1960. By then Arthur’s work in plants and workshops had become harder to keep. He did the job well, but he argued with foremen and took offence at instruction. As Merseyside’s industrial base began to change, jobs went and came back in altered form. In 1968 Nora Keegan died, and Arthur’s connection to the old household ended. He no longer had anyone trying to pull him toward church, and he stopped even pretending; Christmas became a meal and a day off, not a Mass.

His health turned in 1966. The cough that had sat in the background for years became constant, and he began to get short of breath climbing stairs. A GP later, Dr. Sanjay Patel, told him to stop smoking. Arthur listened, argued, and carried on. The breathlessness worsened through the early 1970s. He lost jobs when he couldn’t keep up, then took shorter stints and ended up relying on benefits and help from family. Pride made him sharp. He kept his tools clean even when he had no use for them, polishing and sorting them on the kitchen table.

By the time he reached his late sixties, the household arrangements shifted. Maggie kept her own life and spent long stretches away, staying with family and taking the quiet she needed. Arthur lived with adult relatives, with his daughter Eileen increasingly managing appointments and money. He grew more solitary, choosing the same chair, the same cup, the same route to the corner shop. He still read the paper and corrected people's facts, but he avoided crowds.

Mary died in 1992. She had been the one who kept family threads together, the one who smoothed over quarrels and passed news between siblings. Arthur went to the funeral and said little.

Rita died in 1996 at thirty-six. Arthur stopped speaking about her after the funeral and drank more again. His sister Eileen, who had been blunt about his drinking for decades but never cut him off, died in 1997. Then his heart began to trouble him alongside the damaged lungs. Seán, his oldest brother, died earlier in 2000. In September of that year, living with family rather than with Maggie, Arthur suffered a final cardiac event and died on the twenty-first.

His body was taken to a local cemetery after a church service arranged by family, with a priest speaking the familiar words over the coffin. Flowers sat on the lid, and he was buried in the ground with his name and dates recorded.
