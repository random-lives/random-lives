#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Arrears in labor obligations, marital conflict, debt accumulation,
#       and loss of trust; contributes directly to economic crisis and separation.
#     scene: He promises to weed a paddy section at dawn but sleeps off drinking; father
#       and neighbors finish the work, and his share of harvest/standing suffers.
#     timing: recurring from ages 14-26; peaks after grandmother’s death (1593 onward)
#     trait: Very low conscientiousness (5th percentile)
#   - consequence: Hair-trigger irritability in disputes, avoidance of obligations,
#       and greater reliance on alcohol; fuels the fight at age ~22.
#     scene: After minor setbacks (a sick calf, a torn mat, a stern word from the headman),
#       he spirals into worry and anger, assuming others are talking about him; he drinks
#       to quiet the feeling.
#     timing: visible in adolescence (ages 12-17) and intensifies in adulthood (18-26)
#     trait: High neuroticism (82nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Gives him moments of charm and insight that complicate his 'troublemaker'
#       image; later makes the religious shift feel like an inward reorientation rather
#       than mere compliance.
#     scene: He is drawn to travelers’ stories, new farming tricks, and religious talk;
#       he questions elders and enjoys wayang-like tales and unusual ideas, even as
#       he fails at routine work.
#     timing: childhood through adulthood (ages 8-26)
#     trait: High openness (87th percentile)
#   - consequence: Erodes trust with spouse, kin, and neighbors; worsens the reputational
#       slide and increases social friction.
#     scene: He exaggerates how much work he did or blames others when asked about missing
#       rice bundles or skipped corvée days; small lies to save face become habitual.
#     timing: adulthood (ages 18-25)
#     trait: Lower honesty-humility (30th percentile)
#   - consequence: Contributes to missed farm work/corvée, the assault at age ~22, and
#       vulnerability to illness; later prompts family-driven religious change efforts.
#     scene: Frequent participation in palm-wine/fermented drink sessions; failed attempts
#       to abstain; drinking continues despite debt, marital conflict, and later cough/weakness.
#     timing: onset ages 15-18; severe ages 20-25; partial reduction ages 25-26
#     trait: Alcohol-use disorder (locally available intoxicants)
# number_of_children: '0'
# number_of_siblings: '4'
# occupation: Smallholder rice farmer (manages family plots; primary identity as cultivator)

# - event: After a bad harvest and missed labor obligations, he fell into debt to a

#     surrendered use-rights to part of his sawah and had to work extra days as hired

#   reasoning: A smallholder with a damaged reputation, separation, and alcohol use

#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: Following months of illness and family pressure, he began attending mosque
#     prayers more consistently and stopped participating as fully in some household
#     spirit-placating offerings, framing his misfortunes as a warning to live more
#     'santri' and avoid drunken gatherings.
#   reasoning: Village Islam blended with adat was stable; major conversion or persecution
#     was uncommon for an inland smallholder, though some individuals did shift toward
#     stricter santri practice or lapse.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 24–26 (c. 1596–1599)
#   type: religious_change
# - event: Drunk after an evening gathering, he got into a dispute over repayment and
#     insults with another villager at the edge of the rice fields and beat him with
#     fists and a short stick, leaving the man bloodied and unable to work for several
#     days before elders intervened.
#   reasoning: The most likely form of perpetrated violence is non-lethal assault/brawling,
#     especially given very low conscientiousness, high neuroticism, alcohol-use disorder,
#     and social marginality.

Sastra was born on September 21, 1572, in a small inland settlement in Central Java, where Javanese-speaking farming families lived under village headmen who answered to shifting courts and commanders as Mataram’s power grew. His household prayed in the mosque on some days and kept older customs inside the compound: a tray of rice, salt, and flowers set near a corner post, incense smoke for the house spirit, and slametan meals when fear of misfortune rose.

He arrived as the third child, after two daughters who had already died. The first, Raras, lived only hours in 1569. The second, Sri, lasted through one rainy season and died in 1571. His mother Rukmi carried Sastra cautiously. She kept him close, watched his stools when diarrhea swept the neighborhood, and asked Ni Genduk—her husband’s mother and the senior woman in the house—what offerings to place when the baby cried at night. Ni Genduk set a small bowl of water with jasmine petals near the sleeping mat and murmured the names of ancestors. Sastra’s father Karta went out before dawn, walking the dikes to check water levels, then returned to split bamboo or repair a neighbor’s doorframe for a bit of rice.

Two more daughters came after Sastra. Ningsih was born in 1574 and died the same day. Sari followed in 1576 and also died in infancy. Rukmi spoke less after that. She kept the house swept, cooked rice and greens, and sat with a basket of peeled cassava, pausing to press a hand to her chest when she coughed. The older women handled the offerings and the invitations for slametan meals—small gatherings with cones of rice, boiled eggs, and coconut sweets set out for neighbors and kin.

As a small boy Sastra liked to sit near the edge of the yard where the shade fell in the afternoon. He listened to Ni Genduk tell stories she had learned as a girl—names of places beyond the hills, rulers in old tales, warnings about river spirits. He copied sounds of songs from older boys and sometimes made up his own verses, laughing at his own rhymes. When he was told to fetch water or gather firewood, he moved slowly and left the task half-finished, distracted by a gecko on the wall or a kite passing overhead.

By the 1580s, Karta’s duties expanded beyond the fields. Men were called for labor on paths, irrigation channels, and guards for officials passing through. The village headman, Pak Lurah Wiranta, walked compound to compound with lists and a short staff, calling names. Karta went when required, grumbling but going. Sastra was big for his age by his early teens, quick on his feet, and good at climbing palms for young coconuts. Karta tried to pull him into steady routines—bundling rice straw, mending dikes, carrying baskets of seedlings—but Sastra avoided the hardest parts and vanished when the work turned repetitive.

He started slipping away to evening gatherings before he had a beard. Older youths met near a small stall on the path to the fields. They shared palm wine and a darker fermented drink from earthen jars. Sastra liked the warmth in his stomach and the looseness in his tongue. He teased friends with quick jokes, then took offense when teased back. His friend Larasati laughed loudly at everything and pushed the cup toward him. Sastra drank more than he planned, then showed up late the next morning, blinking into sunlight.

Ni Genduk died in 1593. The compound felt different without her: fewer firm orders, fewer hands guiding Rukmi through household duties. Sastra’s father pressed him harder after the funeral meal, and Sastra met it with sulking and sudden anger. He started sleeping away from the family house more often. When he returned, he came with a loud story, or a sullen silence.

Karta arranged Sastra’s marriage to Wulan in 1591, a young woman from a nearby hamlet. The union was marked with a slametan in the yard: rice cones, banana-leaf parcels of spiced vegetables, sweet tea, neighbors squatting in a circle while a prayer was recited. For a short time Sastra acted like a settled man. He worked alongside his father in the sawah, complained about the mud with a grin, and came home with his feet washed clean at the well.

The change did not last. He missed mornings in the field and gave Wulan excuses that did not match what others had seen. He spent money on drink when it should have gone to cloth and salt. Wulan argued with him in the small house space, voice low when elders were near, sharp when they were alone. She stayed at her parents’ compound more and more, and by 1593 she stopped returning. The separation carried no formal ceremony. It showed itself in the empty sleeping mat and the way her relatives no longer greeted Sastra warmly at the market.

A year later, after an evening of drinking, Sastra walked the paddy edges with unsteady steps. A man named Jaka Wening confronted him about repayment and insults that had been repeated from one mouth to another. Sastra answered with shouting. The argument turned into blows. He hit Jaka with his fists and then with a short stick cut from a branch, striking until Jaka fell and covered his head with his arms. Jaka lay bloodied and missed several days of work.

Pak Lurah Wiranta summoned elders and both families. They sat on mats in a neighbor’s house while tea cooled and flies settled on the edge of a rice tray. Sastra had to provide compensation—food, labor, and a promise of peace. Karta paid part of it with rice and took on extra carpentry jobs to cover the rest. Sastra nodded and agreed in the meeting, then broke his promises within weeks by showing up at gatherings again. After that, doors shut a little faster when he approached. Greetings shortened. People watched him when he walked past stacked sheaves.

The mid-1590s brought a bad season. Rains came unevenly, then too hard. Water stood in the wrong places. A patch of rice yellowed and stunted. At the same time, Sastra skipped village labor days. Pak Lurah’s men noted absences and arrears. Creditors became impatient. A better-off neighbor, Suwanda, offered a settlement: he would cover part of Sastra’s dues in exchange for temporary use-rights to a portion of Sastra’s sawah. Sastra agreed after shouting with his father for half a day. The family’s claim to the land remained, but the harvest from that portion went to Suwanda until the debt cleared.

Sastra’s days filled with hired labor. He carried bundles, weeded others’ fields, and repaired dikes under a foreman’s eye. Some evenings he still drank, but the drink tasted sourer to him when he woke up with mud on his sarong and a head full of dread. Rukmi watched him with a tight face and said little. When she did speak, she scolded him in bursts, then retreated into anxious silence.

A persistent cough began in 1596. At first he dismissed it, spitting into the grass and blaming smoke from cooking fires. The cough stayed. He lost weight, his ribs showing under his skin. He sweated at night and complained that his chest hurt when he bent to transplant seedlings. Karta brought him to a local healer for herbs, and Rukmi burned incense again at the house corner, but Sastra’s breath remained rough.

Under pressure from his family and the quiet disapproval in the village, Sastra changed how he moved through the days. He started attending mosque prayers more consistently. He listened to Kyai Mahfud’s talks and repeated phrases he had learned by ear, though he could not read. When the household prepared certain offerings for the yard corner or the field edge, Sastra stood back and said he wanted to keep to prayer. He still ate at slametan meals, but he stopped taking the first share and refused cups of palm wine in front of elders. Larasati mocked him once for it, and Sastra snapped back, then left early and did not return to that circle.

By early 1599 he stayed mostly in the natal compound. He did little field work. He sat on the edge of the yard, picking at a bamboo strip with his fingernails, coughing into a cloth. Rukmi fed him thin rice porridge and boiled greens. Karta argued with him less, saving his voice for negotiations over debts and land use. Wulan did not come back.

Sastra died on March 26, 1599. His body was washed by male kin, wrapped in cloth, and carried to the village burial ground for a Muslim burial, with simple prayers recited and the grave filled in quickly in the damp earth.
