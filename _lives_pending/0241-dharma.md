#   plain cultural zone
# father_occupation: Attached farm servant/dependent of a landholding household (semi-bonded
#   service, year-round duties)
# historical_context:
# - event: Harsha’s rise and consolidation in the north (Thanesar/Kannauj-centered power),
#     bringing episodic military mobilization and administrative extraction that could
#     reach Haryana villages (supply demands, labor for transport/roads, levies).
#   timing: young adulthood to midlife (c. 606–647; ages 12–53)
# - event: High monsoon variability causing one or more multi-year poor-harvest episodes
#     (reduced yields of millet/wheat/barley, fodder shortages), raising grain prices
#     and increasing dependence on patrons/credit.
#   timing: multiple episodes likely; most consequential in adulthood (c. 620–660; ages
#     26–66)
# - event: Flooding/extreme rainfall years in the Yamuna–Ghaggar/seasonal river systems
#     causing localized crop loss and infrastructure damage (fields, wells, paths),
#     followed by disease spikes.
#   timing: sporadic events across life, more likely during strong-monsoon years (any
#     time c. 600–660)
# - event: Recurring regional epidemics of febrile illness (malaria surges after monsoon;
#     dysentery/enteric outbreaks) with periodic community-wide mortality spikes, not
#     necessarily tied to a single named pandemic.
#   timing: recurrent seasonal pattern throughout life, strongest in monsoon/post-monsoon
#     months (ages 0–67)
# - event: Gradual growth of temple-centered Brahmanical institutions and land grants
#     in North India, increasing the ritual/administrative presence of Brahmins and
#     changing village obligation networks (festivals, fees, patronage).
#   timing: adulthood (c. 620–662; ages 26–67)

Dharma was born in early autumn of 594 in a farming settlement on the dry plain of what is now Haryana, where thorn scrub and fields met and where power shifted between local holders and the larger northern courts that were rising after the Gupta age. His family spoke an Indo‑Aryan village tongue, and the few Sanskrit words he learned came from priests and patrons, not from schooling. Their place in the village was fixed: they lived in a joint household with his father's parents and served a landholding family year-round for rations and protection.

The household had already buried two small children before Dharma could remember them. A brother, Jaya, died the year he was born, and Kamala died as a toddler. Their mother Lila carried that fear into each new pregnancy. When Dharma was small he slept near the cooking place, surrounded by older bodies and the smell of damp grain and smoke. His grandfather Bhima led the home. He handled disputes with other dependents, decided when to ask the patron for seed, and watched for the priest at rite days. At dawn he set a small clay lamp by the household corner shrine. He placed a pinch of rice and a smear of ghee before the image-stone there and said names of ancestors. Dharma learned to stand still with hands together and to repeat the short phrases the priest taught: bits of Sanskrit he did not fully understand, spoken as sounds that belonged to the rite.

Keshava, Dharma’s father, worked under the patron’s steward. He repaired bunds, cut fodder, and drove oxen for plowing when ordered, then did the patron’s compound chores when the fields rested. He did not waste movements. Tools went back to the same spot. Rope coils lay tight and clean. Dharma copied him. When he was five he began carrying water from the well at the edge of the settlement and fetching cow dung for fuel. Bhima corrected him for spilling and for talking when the steward was near. A girl, Sumati, born the year before Dharma, was old enough to mind younger children and keep the grinding stone moving when Lila was out weeding. She pulled Dharma away from quarrels and kept him near tasks he could finish.

Two more girls came quickly after him. Sundari arrived in 596 and Gauri in 597. Hunger and sickness moved through the settlement with the monsoon each year, and Gauri did not reach her third rains. The family’s rites for her were simple: a priest came, rice balls were set out, and Bhima spoke her name once with the ancestors. Dharma watched his mother’s face and learned to look down.

When Dharma was eight he began joining the men at the edges of the patron’s fields. He learned to guide a pair of oxen without jerking the yoke and to keep the plow straight even when the soil turned hard and cracked. He preferred jobs where he could set a rhythm: threshing with a flail, tamping mud on a bund, sorting dung cakes to dry. He avoided crowded talk at the village meeting place and stood at the back when the steward called labor. At night, after eating thin porridge and a little buttermilk when there was any, he lay awake listening for coughing in the dark.

Harsha’s men began to be spoken of openly when Dharma was still young. Carters passed on the road more often. Once, when he was in his teens, the steward gathered dependents for extra transport work: bundles of grain and fodder to a point where soldiers waited. Dharma went without complaint. He counted the bundles twice before leaving them, then checked the knots on the return. Gana, another attached laborer close to his age, teased him for it, calling him “account-keeper” even though neither could read. Dharma only answered with a small smile. Later, away from the steward, he shared roasted gram with Gana and listened while Gana told stories of markets farther east where coins passed hand to hand. Dharma did not like the noise of such places, but he liked the certainty of Gana’s voice.

At seventeen, Bhima arranged Dharma’s marriage. The bride, Sita, came from another dependent household tied to the same landholding cluster. The wedding was held in the patron’s courtyard space with a simple fire and a priest chanting. Dharma repeated lines he had heard before at rites, careful not to stumble. Married life meant more mouths and more obligations. Sita rose before the light, cooked, hauled water, and went out to weed and harvest when called. Dharma moved between field and compound, carrying loads, mending fencing, and tending animals.

Their first child, Anandi, was born in 613. Malati came three years later, then Padma in 620. Dharma took quiet satisfaction in the small signs that his work held the household together: a full storage pot after harvest, a repaired roof before rains, a new rope that did not fray. He liked sitting at the edge of the field at midday with a ball of onions and salt, chewing slowly in the shade of a cart. He disliked idle talk and did not gamble, but he laughed when Gana mocked the steward’s strut while out of earshot.

A son, Ravi, was born in 623 and died the same day. Dharma cleaned the space where the birth had happened and said nothing. He returned to the field the next morning. After that he carried a heavy stillness that did not lift with the seasons. He worked, ate little, and lay awake counting what might fail next: a cracked pot, a sick ox, a child’s cough. Small errors—dropping grain, breaking a handle—hit him hard. Sita scolded him once for staring at the ground when Malati tried to show him a new bracelet string. He answered with a nod and went back to tightening a yoke strap.

Two weak monsoons followed, and the harvests came in thin. In 627 the patron household reduced rations and demanded extra days without pay to make up the shortfall. The steward Kara called the dependents in one by one and wrote nothing, only spoke terms and watched faces. Dharma and Sita had three daughters to feed. They took an advance of grain and seed from Mahipala’s store and accepted the tie it created. For the next years Dharma worked longer hours: night irrigation turns, extra carting, more days in the patron’s compound. He kept his head down and avoided any argument. The debt did not shrink. It became part of the household’s language, spoken in measures of grain and days owed.

Keshava died in 628. The household rites were done under Bhima’s direction, and Dharma took his father’s place without ceremony. Four years later Sumati, the sister who had steadied his childhood, died in a fever season in 632. That loss hit him sharply. He stopped speaking much beyond necessary answers. He moved slowly and forgot small things, then punished himself with extra work. In 635, after the rains, he caught a long fever that left him weak for months. When he returned to the fields he could not lift loads as before. He shifted to tasks that required steadiness more than strength: watching animals, measuring fodder, repairing tools. Kara mocked his slowness once in front of younger men, and Dharma swallowed the anger and only tightened his grip on the rope.

Bhima had died years earlier, in 612, and Lila died in 636. By then Sundari was already gone too, dead at twenty-two in 618 after marriage into another household. Dharma’s surviving sisters, Radha and Nila, remained in the region, married out but near enough to send messages through children. Radha brought him a small bowl of clarified butter one winter and told him to eat it himself instead of giving it away. Nila pushed him to speak plainly when he negotiated for Padma’s marriage arrangements. He did, once, and disliked the feeling it left in him.

Sita died in 650. Dharma did not remarry. Without a surviving son, and with his daughters married, he moved into Anandi’s household. Her husband Udaya accepted him as an extra worker and an extra mouth. Dharma kept his corner swept, fed the animals, and carried water when his joints allowed. He sat at dusk near the cooking fire and listened while Malati recited the lines she had learned for household offerings, careful with the Sanskrit sounds. During festival days he helped prepare rice, lentils, and a small sweet if there was jaggery. He disliked noisy gatherings, but he joined the procession to the local shrine when Anandi insisted, keeping to the edge and watching the lamps.

By the winter of 662, fever was common in the area. After a day of cold wind and smoke, Dharma took to his mat with chills and then heat. Udaya sent for a local healer who rubbed him with warm oil and gave him bitter decoctions. The fever did not break. On January 24, 662, Dharma died in Anandi’s house.

His body was carried to the cremation ground outside the settlement. A priest recited, a small fire was built, and after the burning Anandi placed water and rice on the ground for his journey and added his name to the household ancestor rites.
