#     narrative_role: Nearest-aged sister; affectionate and teasing in youth; later
#       a frequent visitor at festivals who brings news and small gifts from her husband’s
#       village.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Others rely on him in emergencies; however, his calm can be mistaken
#       for underestimating risks, feeding later financial overconfidence.
#     scene: During floods or sudden illness in the house, Changsheng stays calm, speaks
#       evenly, and focuses on the next task (moving tools, boiling water, calling kin)
#       rather than panicking.
#     timing: Recurring; clearly shown in midlife crises (ages 34-50)
#     trait: Neuroticism (very low)
#   - consequence: Builds broad weak-tie support (small loans, help at harvest), but
#       also distracts from chores and irritates more disciplined relatives.
#     scene: At market-town days and temple festivals he chats easily, brokers small
#       favors, and is quick to volunteer for collective labor—often returning home
#       late with news and gossip.
#     timing: Adolescence through midlife (ages 12-45)
#     trait: Extraversion (very high)
#   - consequence: Strong local reputation and trust; yet he is more easily pressured
#       by agents/stronger personalities and less able to bargain hard.
#     scene: In rent disputes he avoids threats, offers what he can, and refuses to
#       cheat measures even when neighbors do; he mediates quarrels rather than escalating.
#     timing: Adult life (ages 20-57)
#     trait: Agreeableness (high) + Honesty-Humility (very high)
#   - consequence: Contributes to arrears and pawning during the 1840s crisis; forces
#       eldest son to shoulder more planning.
#     scene: Misplaces a pawn ticket or forgets an agreed repayment date; lets tool
#       maintenance slip; makes optimistic promises to the landlord’s agent without
#       a plan to meet them.
#     timing: Most visible in midlife financial strain (ages 30-45)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (low)
#   - consequence: Occasionally improves yields or social connections; sometimes wastes
#       effort on unproven ideas, aggravating more cautious kin.
#     scene: Shows curiosity about new songs/stories from boatmen and traveling peddlers;
#       tries small changes in planting timing or varietals after hearing others’ experiences.
#     timing: Young adult to midlife (ages 18-40)
#     trait: Openness (high)
#   - consequence: Higher vulnerability to being shorted or pressured in transactions;
#       strengthens dependence on more capable kin (eldest son, older sister’s husband’s
#       family).
#     scene: Relies on others to read notices, contracts, and pawn tickets; uses memory
#       and verbal agreements, sometimes misunderstanding quantities or dates.
#     timing: Throughout adulthood; salient during theft and rent disputes (ages 34-45)
#     trait: Intelligence (low-average, 20th percentile) with illiteracy
#   - consequence: Smoother entry into marriage and social networks; later less economically
#       protective once poverty deepens.
#     scene: Noted as a 'good-looking' young man at festivals; matchmakers speak well
#       of him, easing his marriage prospects despite modest means.
#     timing: Late teens to early 20s (ages 16-25)
#     trait: Physical attractiveness (very high)
# number_of_children: '5'
# number_of_siblings: '5'

#   Kitchen God, Earth God) and attending temple festivals as needed

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During a winter slack season, someone cut the latch on his grain chest and
#     stole several dou of rice and a small cash string that had been set aside for
#     spring seed and rent, likely taken by a neighbor or a passing boatman from the
#     riverside path.
#   reasoning: Theft of grain/tools and petty fraud were common risks in dense rural
#     communities and markets; poorer households were vulnerable even if they owned
#     little of high value.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Age 34–36
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: After a run of bad harvests and rising rent/fees, he fell into arrears to
#     the landlord’s agent and had to pawn household cloth and a share of tools; the
#     family shifted from mixed holding to mostly tenancy and took day-labor to avoid
#     losing their right to farm the plots.
#   reasoning: He ended somewhat lower status than birth as a poorer tenant/laboring
#     cultivator, and rural Jiangsu households frequently faced debt, rent arrears,
#     crop shocks, and temporary destitution.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Age 41–45
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: He spent many months caring for a close co-resident relative—likely an aging
#     parent—who became weak and intermittently feverish, handling feeding, washing,
#     and arranging simple temple prayers while also trying to keep the fields worked
#     with help from children/kin.
#   reasoning: In a large peasant kin network with high disease burden and limited medical
#     care, it was common for households to spend months nursing an adult relative through
#     serious illness or disability, especially when pooling labor was necessary.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 47–50
#   type: sick_relative

Wu Changsheng was born on September 24, 1798, on Yangzhong’s low river island in Jiangsu, where Qing officials governed through the county yamen and village headmen and most people spoke the local Jianghuai Mandarin speech. His family honored the ancestors with incense and paper money and kept the Kitchen God image above the stove. On the last days of the twelfth lunar month his grandmother Liu-shi pasted fresh red paper on the door and set out a bowl of rice, a few coins, and a cup of tea before the tablets in the hall.

He entered a house that already carried loss. The first son, Wu Dacai, had died in 1788 at two years old; the elders still spoke his name when a baby coughed too hard. Changsheng’s surviving siblings shaped the courtyard’s life: his oldest sister Wu Xiuying with her sharp eyes and quick hands, the middle sister Wu Lanhua who sang while twisting hemp fiber, his brother Wu Ershun who could carry two sheaves at once, and the sister closest to him, Wu Xiuzhen, who teased him for his soft face and the way strangers smiled at him at market.

The household was three generations. His paternal grandfather Wu Shoulin held authority, kept the land boundaries in his head, and decided when to sell a pig or borrow grain. Changsheng learned early to keep his mouth polite in front of him. His grandmother, in charge of the stove and the jars, watched him more gently. She sent him to the riverbank to rinse vegetables and scolded him only when he came back with wet sleeves and no vegetables because he had stopped to talk to boatmen.

His father Wu Fusheng farmed the family’s plots and rented a little extra when the rent was fair. Changsheng followed him into the paddies before he could carry a full bucket, first to pull weeds and later to transplant seedlings in straight rows. In the slack season he ran errands with Ershun—salt, oil, a coil of rope, sometimes a message to an uncle across a canal. He liked the market days more than the fields. He remembered faces, enjoyed the talk at the teahouse stall, and could trade jokes with porters and ferrymen until his mother Zhang-shi called him back, angry that he had forgotten the bean cakes she had sent him to buy.

In 1810, when Changsheng was eleven, his grandfather died. The funeral brought Daoist ritual specialists to chant and ring bells, and the family set out steamed buns, fish, and bowls of rice wine before the coffin. After that, the house loosened. His father still worked hard, but he let Changsheng slip away to the river landing more often. Changsheng never held fear close. When a summer storm knocked down stalks, he waded in without complaint, calm and talkative, giving orders as if the work were easy.

Five years later Ershun died at twenty-one. The village spoke of a fever that took him quickly. Changsheng helped wash the body and stood through the rites with incense burning in his hands, then went back to the fields because seedlings did not wait. The death changed how others looked at him. He became the only surviving son, the one who had to carry the line and keep the tablets supplied with offerings.

At twenty-two he married Chen-shi, a woman from a nearby village, brought by Zhou Matchmaker. She arrived with a small chest of cloth, bowls wrapped in straw, and a woven basket. Changsheng’s good looks eased the match; even the older women said he would not embarrass the family. Chen-shi proved steady in ways he was not. She could count strings of cash and remember who had borrowed a hoe. Changsheng preferred to settle things by talk and handshakes, and he disliked sitting still long enough to learn characters. If a notice was posted outside the yamen or a contract needed reading, he asked others.

Their first son, Wu Jinchang, was born in 1821. In 1824 a second son arrived, Wu Shunhe, and in 1827 a third son, Wu Sanbao, lived only a short time. The household burned paper and set out a small bowl of porridge for the infant’s spirit, then returned to planting. Two daughters followed, Wu Ailan in 1830 and Wu Yumei in 1832. Changsheng enjoyed infants and small children. He carried them on his hip while talking to neighbors, laughed when they pulled at his hair, and brought home sweet potatoes roasted in the market ashes.

In 1831 his sister Wu Lanhua died at thirty-nine. Changsheng went to her husband’s village for the mourning. He handled the practical work—fetching water, helping fold the burial clothes—without shaking. On the last night he sat outside with Shen Laosi, a neighbor who made him laugh, and they shared a bottle of thin rice wine and salted peanuts while the women inside wept.

The mid-1830s brought pressure that did not come from any one storm. Rent collectors demanded payment in good silver. Prices shifted in ways Changsheng did not understand, and pawnbrokers grew more important in the town. Changsheng kept his temper and tried to smooth every conversation, but his household accounts were loose. He mislaid a pawn ticket once and spent a day searching under mats and jars while Chen-shi looked at him with hard eyes.

In the winter of 1833, after the harvest had been stored and the paddies lay quiet, someone came at night by the riverside path. The latch on the grain chest was cut. Several dou of rice were gone, and a small string of copper cash that Changsheng had tied in cloth for spring seed and rent had vanished with it. He confronted no one directly. He went from house to house asking calmly, half-joking, as if the thief might confess for shame. Shen Laosi avoided his eyes. Changsheng never proved anything.

By 1839, talk of war reached the river towns. Salt boats and grain boats moved differently, and people repeated rumors about foreign ships and coastal fighting. The changes came to Changsheng in the form of uncertainty: traders offered worse terms, the landlord’s agent demanded payment on stricter dates, and small debts grew teeth. Qian Youtong, the rent-collector, came more often. Changsheng spoke politely to him and offered tea, promising payment after the next threshing. Qian listened without warmth and wrote marks in a book Changsheng could not read.

In 1841 the household broke into its reserves. Chen-shi pawned cloth. A share of tools went next. Changsheng took day-labor work hauling and repairing dike earth when it was offered, then returned to his own rented fields at night. Jinchang, still young, began to plan the household’s work with a seriousness that embarrassed his father. Changsheng smiled and agreed to schedules he did not keep. He showed up late to a ditch-clearing, still cheerful, and was cursed by men who had been waiting.

Hard years continued into the late 1840s with grain price spikes and wet seasons that left the paddies sour. In 1846 Changsheng’s father Wu Fusheng became weak and feverish. Changsheng moved him closer to the stove, fed him thin rice gruel, and washed him with warm water heated in a clay pot. He asked Master Zhao at the local temple to perform a small rite and burned incense before the Earth God at the field edge, setting out a few coins and a bowl of rice. The nursing lasted months. Changsheng stayed steady, never frantic, even when work piled up. He relied on his children and kin for labor and accepted help without pride.

His wife Chen-shi died in 1850, before the household regained its footing. By then Jinchang was a grown man and the daughters were near marriageable age. Changsheng remained head of the house, a widower, with younger dependents and grandchildren under the roof. He kept the ancestor tablets dusted and watched the Kitchen God image darken with smoke.

Worries grew sharper as the Taiping forces moved through the lower Yangtze region. Travelers brought stories of requisitions and bandit gangs. Changsheng’s calm did not change, but he slept lighter. He stored a little grain in a concealed jar and told the children not to talk about it outside. In 1854 his second son Shunhe died at thirty, another blow that left fewer hands for the fields and fewer voices at the evening meal.

On March 22, 1856, Changsheng rose and spoke normally, then collapsed in the courtyard. He did not get up again. The household washed him, dressed him in clean clothes, and laid him on a board. They burned incense and paper money before the tablets, and after the mourning days they carried him to burial ground near the village, setting a small offering of rice, tea, and joss paper at the grave.
