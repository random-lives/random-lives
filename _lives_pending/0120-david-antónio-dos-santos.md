#   - death_year: null
#     name: António dos Santos
#     narrative_role: Lower-level supervisor with regular hours; brings home routine
#       (evening greetings, small rules). Uses some English phrases from work; David
#       responds to these predictable scripts.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Márcia Pereira dos Santos
#     narrative_role: Market trader/small retail; early mornings and long days. Primary
#       emotional anchor; teaches short prayers and practical habits (washing hands,

#     role: mother
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Irmã Cecília
#     narrative_role: A familiar non-kin adult at the mainline Protestant church. David
#       is wary at first but grows comfortable with her calm voice and consistent routines.
#     role: church Sunday-school/helper adult
#   developmental_moments:
#   - age: 2;6 (mid-2025)
#     detail: While his siblings argue over a toy car, David sits slightly apart and
#       points, naming objects under his breath—“carro… car,” “água… water.” He does
#       it like a private game, checking his mother’s face for a small nod rather than
#       trying to perform for the room.
#     moment: A quiet bilingual ‘labeling’ habit
#   - age: 3;0–3;2 (early 2026)
#     detail: At home, when the older children start a loud chasing game, David steps
#       back to a corner near the doorway and lines up flip-flops in pairs (adult sizes
#       first, then children’s). When someone kicks the line by accident, he goes still,
#       then quietly rebuilds it—no big tantrum, but clear stubborn insistence on ‘his’
#       order.
#     moment: Refusing the noisy game, choosing a corner ritual
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Sr. Tomás
#     prominence: minor
#     relationship: market stall neighbor to the mother
#   - name: Dona Filomena
#     prominence: minor
#     relationship: neighbor who occasionally watches the younger children for a short
#       time
#   personality_manifestations:
#   - behavior: Clings to familiar adults, watches other children before joining, often
#       chooses parallel play (same room, separate activity). In church he stays close
#       to a parent and avoids greeting new people unless prompted.
#     trait: Very low Extraversion (1st percentile)
#   - behavior: 'Curious about how things work: taps, switches, bottle caps, phone screens;
#       likes naming and categorizing objects, and is drawn to picture books or packaging
#       with letters.'
#     trait: High Openness (70th percentile)
#   - behavior: Picks up new words quickly (especially nouns), notices small changes
#       in routines, and remembers where specific household items ‘belong’—which feeds
#       his shoe-pairing/lining-up rituals.
#     trait: Higher Intelligence (72nd percentile)
#   - behavior: When startled (a shout, a dropped pan), he freezes and retreats rather
#       than melting down; recovers steadily if a caregiver speaks softly and keeps
#       the routine.
#     trait: Lower Neuroticism (28th percentile)
#   - behavior: Will help in small, concrete ways (handing a diaper, bringing a cloth)
#       but resists sharing a favored object; disputes are more quiet refusal than explosive
#       tantrums.
#     trait: Mid Conscientiousness / Agreeableness (47th / 44th percentile)

David António dos Santos was born on January 18, 2023, in Luanda, Angola’s crowded coastal capital, under the government of the MPLA and a cash economy shaped by oil money and constant price swings. His family moved easily through Portuguese, and his parents also kept English in the house, the kind used for work and school ambition. They were mestiço and mainline Protestant, the sort of household that went to church on Sundays and prayed in short phrases at home.

His father, António dos Santos, supervised shifts for a firm and came home tired but orderly, greeting each child and asking who had done what. His mother, Márcia Pereira dos Santos, sold goods in informal retail and left early for the market, where stall neighbors like Sr. Tomás watched over the day’s small bargains and gossip. Eight children made noise in their apartment, but David, the fourth, stayed inside the edges of it. Daniel, born in 2014, could run errands. Sara, born in 2016, talked to everyone, including adults at church. Cláudia, born in 2018, hovered closest to David and fought him over toys.

Mid-2025, David began a private habit: he sat apart from the arguments and pointed at objects, naming them softly in pairs—“carro… car,” “água… water”—then looked up at Márcia for a nod, not applause. When his younger brother Mateus arrived in 2024 and cried often, David brought a cloth without being asked and then slipped away to the quiet corner near the door.

By late 2025 the house held another baby, Rafael, born that year. The older children chased and shouted through the rooms. David took the flip-flops and lined them into pairs by size, adult sandals first, then children’s, restoring the line each time a foot scattered it. On Sundays he stands close to António in church, listening to the familiar hymns, whispering a few words along, and keeping his hands on his own small order of things.
