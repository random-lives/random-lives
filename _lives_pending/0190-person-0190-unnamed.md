#   - death_year: 1235
#     name: Keshava
#     narrative_role: Land-poor tenant cultivator who mixed subsistence farming with
#       wage labor; present at the birth but largely outside the birthing space. Relationship
#       quality (as imagined in the narrative) would be dutiful and protective in a
#       practical way, filtered through work demands and the authority structure of
#       a joint household.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: 1248
#     name: Sundarī
#     narrative_role: Primary caregiver and field laborer within the joint household;
#       endured multiple infant losses. Her bond with the protagonist would have been
#       immediate but heartbreakingly brief, dominated by the physical strain of childbirth
#       and the shock of a baby who did not breathe well.
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: 1226
#     name: Dīnarāyaṇa
#     narrative_role: Senior male in the joint household, likely controlling tenancy
#       arrangements and major decisions. Relationship quality would be authoritative
#       rather than tender; his concern would focus on lineage continuity and household
#       survival.
#     role: paternal grandfather
#   - death_year: 1232
#     name: Jasodā
#     narrative_role: Senior woman overseeing domestic rhythms and postpartum customs;
#       likely directed ritual responses (oil lamp, offerings, protective measures)
#       after the baby’s distress. Relationship quality would be practical and watchful,
#       shaped by experience of earlier losses.
#     role: paternal grandmother

#     death_age: 4
#     death_year: 1192
#     name: Sītā
#     narrative_role: Firstborn daughter who died in early childhood long before the
#       protagonist’s birth; remembered only through the mother’s stories and the lingering
#       grief that shaped how the household treated later newborns.
#     sex: F

#     death_age: 29
#     death_year: 1218
#     name: Rāmā
#     narrative_role: Eldest surviving son during the protagonist’s birth; already taking
#       on adult work and responsibility in the joint household. Would have been the
#       figure expected to step in during crises and to represent the natal family to
#       the village.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1191
#     death_age: 56
#     death_year: 1247
#     name: Gaurī
#     narrative_role: Older sister alive at the birth; likely helping with water, fuel,
#       childcare, and women’s work. In a different outcome she might have been the
#       one to hold the baby first; in family memory, her life becomes part of the ‘before
#       and after’ of repeated infant losses.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: 1192
#     death_age: 87
#     death_year: 1279
#     name: Mādhava
#     narrative_role: Older brother alive at the birth; as he matured he would become
#       a mainstay of labor and later an elder of the lineage. The protagonist’s brief
#       life would register for him as one more fragile birth in a crowded, precarious
#       household.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1199
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 1199
#     name: Mallikā
#     narrative_role: Older sister who died in infancy two years before the protagonist;
#       her death is close enough in time that it would have intensified fear and protective
#       ritual around the next pregnancies.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: 1203
#     death_age: 62
#     death_year: 1265
#     name: Kamala
#     narrative_role: Younger sister born after the protagonist; would grow up hearing
#       that a brother was born and lost the same day. As an adult, she may become one
#       of the keepers of that memory, repeating it during family rites and at other
#       births.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: 1205
#     death_age: 1
#     death_year: 1206
#     name: Hari
#     narrative_role: Younger brother who survived only a year; his brief life reinforces
#       a household pattern of repeated neonatal/infant deaths, shaping later decisions
#       about vows, offerings, and how quickly babies were shown to outsiders.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1207
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 1207
#     name: Rūpā
#     narrative_role: Younger sister who died at birth; in household storytelling she
#       becomes part of a string of losses attributed to fate, illness, or malevolent
#       forces needing propitiation.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: 1210
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 1210
#     name: Nandana
#     narrative_role: Youngest brother, also lost at birth; his death comes years after
#       the protagonist and would reopen old grief, making the protagonist’s death feel
#       less like a singular tragedy and more like a recurring household calamity.
#     sex: M

Sundarī’s household stood on the flat, wet fields near the Kosi’s channels in the Mithila country, where Eastern Indo-Aryan speech filled the lanes and a village headman answered upward to distant lords collecting revenue. Keshava farmed a small rented strip and took day wages when the work ran out. They lived in a joint compound under Dīnarāyaṇa’s authority, with Jasodā running the hearthside tasks and the women sharing water-carrying, husking, and weeding.

The births had come close together. Sītā, the first, lay in the ground since 1192. Mallikā had been born and lost in 1199. Three children lived: Rāmā, already a grown man who handled ploughing teams and bargaining with landlords; Gaurī, old enough to help Sundarī grind grain and watch smaller children; and Mādhava, a boy quick on errands between house and field.

On March 9, 1201, Nirmalā, an experienced village midwife, squatted beside Sundarī on the packed earth floor. Jasodā heated water and set a small lamp near the doorway. The labor dragged. Sundarī strained, and the baby came out limp. Nirmalā rubbed him hard and cleared his mouth; Keshava waited outside the room, listening for a cry that did not come.

The infant, a son, was called Nandana in the moment, for a hopeful name. He died before midday. That evening Deva Miśra spoke brief Sanskrit over a pinch of rice and a spoon of ghee, and Dīnarāyaṇa carried the small body to the riverbank and set it into the moving water.
