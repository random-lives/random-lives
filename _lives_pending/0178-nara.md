Nara was born into a Yue-speaking village in the hills and wet flats above the Pearl River’s southern edge, where fields and fish traps tied families to one place and power rested with local headmen and lineages rather than distant northern courts. Her household kept a small ancestor place: a cleared shelf near the wall where food was set out, and where her grandmother Nopi rubbed oil on children’s chests and asked the house-dead and the land by the paddies to keep sickness away.

Her father Halu managed the rice plots and the ties that held the household together. He had two partners. Nara’s mother Kesa carried her through the transplanting season and set her down on a dry bank while her hands stayed in the water. The other woman, Sira, watched children when the adults worked and kept the hearth going.

Nara’s older sister Mina had already died, and the name stayed close in the adults’ mouths. When Nara cried at sudden noises—a shout from the paddy, a flock of birds breaking out of brush—Kesa pulled her in quickly, as if sound itself could snatch her away.

At two and a half, Nara squatted at the paddy edge and copied the work she saw. She pushed a few rice shoots into a muddy puddle with two fingers, patted them down, and then stood up fast when cold water touched her feet. She demanded to be carried, wiping her hands on Kesa’s skirt and watching from higher up.

When Salu was born, Nara brought his gourd cup and insisted it sit beside him. His crying sent her running back to her mother, but later she hovered near the sleeping baby and stroked his hair, scolding another child, Rumi, for leaning too close.

In her fourth year a cough took hold and did not break. Tewa, the village healer, smoked the room with bitter leaves and Sira set a small bowl of rice and fish by the ancestor shelf. Nara died before the next planting. Her body was wrapped in woven matting and placed in a shallow grave above the fields, with a pinch of cooked rice set near her hands.
