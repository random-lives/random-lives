#   - death_year: 1170
#     name: Somadeva
#     narrative_role: Town service worker; likely present for the birth but with limited
#       control over illness. Relationship quality (had Durgādeva lived) would likely
#       have been affectionate but time-constrained, shaped by work demands; later carried
#       the grief quietly while focusing on providing for the surviving children.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: 1185
#     name: Kamalā
#     narrative_role: Primary caregiver; survived childbirth. Her relationship to Durgādeva
#       was intensely immediate—postpartum care, protective rites, and then mourning.
#       Later became more vigilant with subsequent births, leaning on women kin and
#       ritual specialists.
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: 1146
#     name: Nandinī
#     narrative_role: 'Elder woman in the stem household; likely directed postpartum
#       seclusion, household offerings, and protective measures, and may have interpreted
#       the illness through local-spirit/protection frameworks. Relationship quality:
#       close-in-practice (hands-on), authority tempered by care.'

#     death_year: 1192
#     name: Gopāla
#     narrative_role: Older brother, about two years senior; in family memory he became
#       the long-lived anchor sibling who carried the household line and later told
#       (or heard) the brief story of Durgādeva’s few days as part of the family’s losses.

#     death_year: 1133
#     name: Durgādeva
#     narrative_role: Second child; lived only a few days, remembered mostly through

#   - birth_year: 1135
#     death_age: 18
#     death_year: 1153
#     name: Mādhava
#     narrative_role: Younger brother born after the loss; grew up under a more protective
#       household atmosphere, likely heard that he was born after an elder brother ‘did
#       not take’—a shadow-story that shaped how caretakers treated him.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1137
#     death_age: 3
#     death_year: 1140
#     name: Hari
#     narrative_role: Younger brother who survived infancy but died in early childhood;
#       his death would have reinforced the family’s reliance on protective rites, making
#       Durgādeva’s brief life part of a cluster of early losses.

#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 1139
#     name: Keshava
#     narrative_role: Younger brother who died as a neonate; likely prompted renewed
#       ritual responses and practical changes (midwife choice, postpartum seclusion,
#       amulets), with Durgādeva retrospectively folded into a pattern of ‘unlucky’
#       births the family tried to avert.

#   - birth_year: 1142
#     death_age: 35
#     death_year: 1177
#     name: Chandra
#     narrative_role: Youngest sibling and only sister; grew up with stories of multiple
#       lost brothers before her, and may have been especially treasured/protected;
#       in later years she would have been one of the main keepers of household memory
#       of the infants who died.

Begampur in the lower Ganges plain lay under Sena authority, with Bengali-speaking Gauda/Bangala towns and market villages tied to river traffic and rice country. Somadeva earned his living in town service, hired for errands, watching store yards at night, and carrying messages between shopkeepers and boatmen. His household was a stem family: Somadeva and his wife Kamalā lived with his widowed mother Nandinī, and their first child, Gopāla, a small boy who already ran to the lane when vendors called.

On February 8, 1133, Kamalā delivered a second son in the family room behind the courtyard. Nandinī oversaw the birth with their neighborhood attendant, Dhanapati. A lamp burned beside a small shelf where they kept clay figures and a smear of vermilion for protective powers; Kamalā’s sister brought rice, mustard oil, and clean cloth. They spoke their eastern Indo-Aryan speech in the house, and Nandinī recited short Sanskrit lines she knew for childbirth.

They called the baby Durgādeva and tied a thread at his wrist. Kamalā kept him close, fed him, and stayed secluded while Somadeva fetched water and paid for extra fuel so the room stayed warm at night.

On the third day the infant’s belly tightened and his skin turned hot. By February 11 he lay still in Kamalā’s arms. Somadeva carried the small body to the riverbank before midday; Dhanapati marked the forehead with a pinch of red, and Nandinī set a little rice and a few drops of water beside him before they consigned him to the current.
