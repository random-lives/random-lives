#   - death_year: null
#     name: Rukundo rwa Pawulo
#     narrative_role: 'Primary caregiver (breastfeeding, warmth, immediate postpartum
#       care). Relationship is intensely close but extremely brief: two days of holding,
#       attempting to feed, and responding to signs of sickness. No evidence she died
#       in childbirth; most likely she survived and carried prolonged grief and fear
#       into later pregnancies.'
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Rugamba rwa Sekarongoro
#     narrative_role: Household head; cultivator with some livestock. Likely involved
#       indirectly in newborn care (providing food, firewood arrangements, summoning
#       an elder/ritual specialist if the baby worsened). Relationship with Munyaneza
#       was real but mediated through the mother and the urgency of illness.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Nyirakuru wa Sebatware
#     narrative_role: 'In many rural households an older woman was central in postpartum
#       support: advising on warmth, bathing/cord care, and protective practices. She
#       may have urged customary precautions and, if the baby showed signs of infection,
#       advocated consulting a diviner/healer. Relationship quality: practical, authoritative,
#       supportive of the mother; her presence would be felt more than individualized
#       by the newborn.'

#     narrative_role: Eldest surviving son; old enough at Munyaneza’s birth to be a
#       helpful presence around the homestead (errands, herding small stock, watching
#       younger children). Alive at Munyaneza’s birth; outlived him by decades and likely

#     narrative_role: Second child who died in infancy; a remembered absence more than

#     narrative_role: Closest older surviving sibling; about four years old when Munyaneza
#       was born. Too young to help much, but old enough to have been shooed away from
#       the sleeping area, to have heard adults’ worry, and later to have a faint family

#     narrative_role: Protagonist; fifth child, died at two days old from neonatal infection.
#       His death would have been interpreted through family ritual life (concern about
#       impurity, spirits, or misfortune) and would have affected spacing, care, and
#       household mood around subsequent births.

Munyaneza was born on September 3, 1818, in the hills of Byimana in the Kingdom of Rwanda, where Kinyarwanda-speaking Hutu cultivator families lived under local chiefs and owed labor and tribute through patronage ties. His father, Rugamba rwa Sekarongoro, worked banana stands and sorghum plots and kept a few goats. His mother, Rukundo rwa Pawulo, weeded, harvested, cooked, and carried water up the slope to their compound.

Two boys already lived in the household. Karemera, born in 1808, moved between fields and home with small tasks and watched for stray goats. Sebatware, born in 1814, stayed close to his mother and copied what he could, carrying handfuls of firewood and getting in the way. Between them had been two births that ended quickly: Rwabukumba in 1811 and Nyirampuhwe in 1813, losses spoken of in the same low voice used for sickness.

At the birth, the paternal grandmother, Nyirakuru wa Sebatware, took charge of the sleeping place and the cord, keeping the baby close to warmth and smoke. On the second day the cord site swelled and seeped, and Rukundo kept washing and wrapping it while Rugamba sent word to the diviner-healer Rwitekerezo. Munyaneza died on September 5 before any remedy was prepared.

They washed his body, wrapped him in cloth, and buried him in the family ground near the homestead. Rukundo set a small bowl of sorghum beer and a pinch of flour beside the burial place, naming ancestors aloud.
