#   with regular fishing/foraging
# historical_context:
# - event: High seasonal disease burden tied to monsoon and standing water (malaria-like

#     demands.
#   timing: recurring annually, especially during ages 0–5

# household_social_status: Ordinary household (typical subsistence family; no special
#   rank)
# household_structure_at_birth: Joint/compound household of multiple related married
#   couples (e.g., brothers with their wives) sharing a dwelling/yard cluster
# language: Austroasiatic (Munda-related) language (local prehistoric variety)
# literacy: Neither read nor write
# mental_disorder: Clinically significant anxiety-related disorder (e.g., separation
#   anxiety/generalized anxiety; persistent fearfulness/avoidance)
# migration: Stayed in the same local area (same village/territory; only routine short
#   trips)

# narrative_plan:
#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Boru
#     narrative_role: Mixed subsistence cultivator-fisher; present and hardworking,
#       often away at fields or river. Relationship is affectionate but practical—he
#       expects toughness; he tries to coax Miri into the yard and praises small bravery.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Nali
#     narrative_role: Primary caregiver; does cooking/pounding/fieldwork and coordinates
#       older children. She is Miri’s safe base; his anxiety shows as clinging to her
#       skirt and crying when she leaves for the fields.
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Aru
#     narrative_role: Elder who leads everyday ancestor offerings at the household spot;
#       interprets illness as imbalance/anger of spirits or ancestors. She comforts
#       Miri with ritual routines (smoke, leaf-washes) but can also reinforce his fears
#       by warning him about wandering spirits and strangers.
#     role: paternal grandmother (in compound household)
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Kena
#     narrative_role: One of the other married men sharing the yard cluster; sets rules
#       about children near river/canoes. He is a source of both protection (during
#       tensions with neighboring groups) and intimidation (stern voice, quick to grab
#       a child away from danger).
#     role: paternal uncle (co-resident adult male in joint/compound household)
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 3.75
#     connection: Happens during a heavy-rain season when many in the compound are sick;
#       the eye problem follows a prolonged fever and worsens his separation anxiety
#       (he feels unsafe moving around without a familiar hand). It also shifts how
#       siblings supervise him—Luma guides him; Koru keeps him closer to the yard.
#     incident: acquired_disability (one-eye cloudiness/poor vision after severe eye
#       infection during monsoon fever)
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Suru
#     prominence: ages 3–5; highlights Miri’s shyness and avoidance in group play
#     relationship: older child from a neighboring household in the same yard cluster;
#       frequent playmate/teaser
#   - name: Gama
#     prominence: around age 3.5–4 during the fever/eye infection period
#     relationship: ritual healer/diviner (non-elite specialist) occasionally called
#       during sickness seasons
#   - name: Toku
#     prominence: one brief episode between ages 2–5; used to show Miri’s fear of strangers
#       and the compound’s vigilance during inter-group tensions
#     relationship: river trader/visitor arriving by canoe with salt/stone/other goods;
#       an unfamiliar outsider
#   siblings:
#   - birth_year: -1706
#     death_age: 16
#     death_year: -1690
#     name: Tana
#     narrative_role: Oldest sister and early co-caretaker; a steady presence who carried
#       him on her hip and taught him small tasks. Her later sickness/death becomes
#       one of his earliest, most frightening memories and intensifies his clingy anxiety.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -1704
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: -1704
#     name: Sali
#     narrative_role: A baby remembered through family talk rather than personal memory;
#       her absence is folded into the household’s ancestor offerings and everyday caution
#       around infants.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -1701
#     death_age: 51
#     death_year: -1650
#     name: Koru
#     narrative_role: Main older brother figure; already competent at fishing and field
#       clearing while Miri is small. He is protective, sometimes impatient with Miri’s
#       fearfulness, but reliably brings him small treats (roasted fish bits) and reassures
#       him during storms.

#   - birth_year: -1697
#     death_age: 58
#     death_year: -1639
#     name: Luma
#     narrative_role: Older sister close enough in age to be a play companion; she is
#       the one who understands his shyness and guides him around the compound, warning
#       him away from deep water and thorny brush.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -1694
#     death_age: 2
#     death_year: -1692
#     name: Daro
#     narrative_role: A toddler brother whose death (before Miri is old enough to fully
#       grasp it) becomes part of the household’s repeated grief; elders reference it
#       when urging vigilance during fever seasons.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: -1690
#     death_age: 5
#     death_year: -1684
#     name: Miri
#     narrative_role: Protagonist; quiet, compliant, unusually honest for a child, and
#       markedly anxious—especially about separation and strangers.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: -1689
#     death_age: 3
#     death_year: -1686
#     name: Hako
#     narrative_role: Younger brother and frequent trigger for Miri’s anxiety (fear
#       of losing him, fear of being blamed). Their closeness is physical—sleeping near
#       each other—and Miri tries to soothe him, but becomes distressed when adults
#       carry Hako away during illness.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: -1686
#     death_age: 53
#     death_year: -1633
#     name: Poro
#     narrative_role: Youngest; as an infant he draws household attention away from
#       Miri, sharpening Miri’s separation anxiety. Miri is gentle with him and fascinated
#       by watching his tiny movements, but avoids holding him without an adult present.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Limits exploration and learning of outdoor tasks; adults accommodate
#       by keeping him near the cooking area and assigning an older sibling to watch
#       him, which also brings teasing from peers.
#     scene: When Nali leaves at dawn for the fields, Miri panics, follows crying to
#       the path edge, and refuses food until she returns; he startles at unfamiliar
#       footsteps and hides behind Aru’s legs when outsiders arrive by canoe.
#     timing: visible from ages 2–5; intensifies after age ~3–4 (illnesses and the eye
#       injury)
#     trait: Clinically significant anxiety-related disorder (separation/generalized
#       anxiety)
#   - consequence: Fewer peer bonds; stronger attachment to one or two siblings (especially
#       Luma) and to his mother.
#     scene: During group play, he prefers quiet watching and small, repetitive games
#       (sorting seeds, tapping a stick rhythm) rather than joining loud chasing; he
#       speaks softly and only to familiar siblings.
#     timing: ages 3–5
#     trait: Low Extraversion (17th percentile)
#   - consequence: Adults describe him as 'easy' and 'gentle,' so he is entrusted with
#       small calming tasks (fanning embers, watching the baby from a doorway), but
#       other children may push him around.
#     scene: He yields toys/food bits to younger children, tries to soothe Hako when
#       he cries, and avoids hitting even when jostled—he instead retreats and looks
#       for an adult.
#     timing: ages 3–5
#     trait: High Agreeableness (74th percentile)
#   - consequence: Builds adult trust and earns protection; elders are more patient
#       with his fears because they see him as straightforward and not 'tricky.'
#     scene: If he spills grain or breaks a small clay cup, he immediately confesses
#       rather than hiding it; he returns found items (a fishhook, a cord) to the adults
#       without being prompted.
#     timing: ages 3–5
#     trait: High Honesty-Humility (87th percentile)
#   - consequence: Fatigue and irritability; makes him more dependent on close routines
#       (ancestor-offering moments, fixed sleeping spot).
#     scene: He anticipates trouble—worries about thunder long before it arrives, asks
#       repeatedly whether the river is 'rising,' and has disturbed sleep with sudden
#       waking during heavy rain.
#     timing: ages 3–5, especially in monsoon
#     trait: Higher Neuroticism (70th percentile) beyond the anxiety diagnosis
#   - consequence: Adaptation to new tasks is slow; caregivers use repetition and ritual
#       reassurance rather than novelty-based encouragement.
#     scene: He resists new foods and unfamiliar forest paths, preferring the same bowl,
#       the same corner by the hearth, and the same small set of games; he becomes distressed
#       when household routines change due to visitors or tension with neighbors.
#     timing: ages 2–5
#     trait: Low Openness (19th percentile)
# number_of_siblings: '7'
# religion: 'Ancestor veneration: offerings at home or clan spots; funerary/commemorative
#   rites; calling ancestors for protection/health'
# sibling_ages_at_death:

# structured_incidents:
# - event: After a bad fever with inflamed, crusted eyes during the monsoon season (an
#     infection like severe conjunctivitis/trachoma), his eyesight in one eye never
#     fully recovered; he was left with persistent cloudiness and poor vision, making
#     him clingier around the house-yard and less able to follow older children into
#     the forest edge.
#   reasoning: Acquired disability (e.g., eye damage from infection/trauma, hearing
#     loss after severe infections) occurs, but reaching a disabling, noticeable level
#     within a short 0–5 lifespan is relatively uncommon.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: sustained condition beginning around age 3.5–4 and continuing until death
#     at age 5
#   type: acquired_disability

Miri was born into an Austroasiatic-speaking river-valley community in the wet forests of the upper Brahmaputra, where authority sat with elders in a few related households and disputes with neighboring settlements flared over fishing stretches and forest edges. His compound held several married couples, their children, and an old grandmother, Aru, who kept a small ancestor place under the eaves: a flat stone darkened with smoke, a clay cup for rice beer, and a dish for fish and cooked grain.

The household had already known loss. Tana, the eldest daughter, had died of fever before Miri's first year ended. Daro, a toddler brother, had died the year before Miri was born. These names were spoken at the ancestor place, and Aru warned the children about wandering spirits. The deaths made the adults watchful when fevers came.

His father, Boru, cleared and planted small fields and set traps and nets in the creeks. His mother, Nali, pounded grain, cooked, carried water, and weeded with the other women. Koru, the eldest surviving brother, was already competent at fishing and field clearing. He brought Miri roasted fish bits and reassured him during storms. Luma, an older sister closer in age, guided him around the compound, warning him away from deep water and thorny brush.

Miri stayed close to Nali. When she stepped onto the path at dawn, he followed crying until she turned back and lifted him once, then handed him to Luma to keep him in the yard. He watched more than he joined. The louder children chased each other between posts and canoes; he sorted seeds, tapped a stick against the packed earth, and gave up what he held when a younger child reached for it. A younger brother, Hako, was born when Miri was about two, and the two slept near each other. Miri tried to soothe Hako when he cried.

At four, during the monsoon, a long fever left Miri's eyelids crusted and swollen. Aru set extra offerings—beer, a smear of fat, a pinch of ash—calling to the dead by name. When the swelling went down, one eye stayed cloudy. Luma took his hand to lead him around cooking fires and puddles, and Boru stopped urging him toward the forest edge. That same year, Hako fell sick and died.

Another baby, Poro, was born shortly after. Miri watched him with care but avoided holding him without an adult present. In his fifth year, after days of coughing and fast breathing, Nali kept him by the hearth. He died there. Boru and Koru wrapped him in woven leaves and placed him in a shallow pit on higher ground near the compound, with a small lump of cooked grain and a few drops of rice beer for the ancestors.
