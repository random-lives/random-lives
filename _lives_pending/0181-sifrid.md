#     name: Cord
#     narrative_role: Tenant peasant farmer; emotionally and economically centered on
#       keeping the holding intact. He likely experienced Sifrid’s death as a grim but
#       not uncommon blow, turning quickly to funeral obligations and work. Relationship
#       quality with Sifrid is necessarily indirect—recognition as firstborn, urgency
#       for baptism, and the father’s presence at or just after the birth.

#     narrative_role: Peasant housewife and farm worker; bore the physical and emotional
#       burden of repeated risky births. With Sifrid, her relationship is intimate but

Sifrid was born on 4 September 1361 in the village of Dachtmissen, in the Saxon-speaking countryside of the Holy Roman Empire. The lord’s rights and dues shaped his family’s days: Cord held his strips and pasture as a dependent tenant, owing rents and labor services, and he spoke Low Saxon like the rest of the village. The parish church ordered the week and the year. Latin prayers belonged to the priest; at home they used the Pater Noster and Ave Maria, crossed themselves, and called on saints for protection at childbirth.

Cord’s household included his wife Elsabe and Cord’s widowed mother, Grete, who kept a close hand in the byre and kitchen and knew what to fetch when labor began. That morning Elsabe labored in the main room while Grete warmed water and laid out clean cloth. A neighbor went for Herme, the midwife, and another ran to tell the priest.

The child came badly. His head crowned and then the birth stalled. Herme pressed and shifted Elsabe’s hips. Grete held a candle and spoke prayers under her breath. When Sifrid finally emerged, he did not cry. Herme rubbed his chest hard with cloth and cleared his mouth with a finger. Grete traced a cross on his forehead and whispered the baptismal words with water from the bowl.

Before evening he was dead. Cord carried the small wrapped body to the churchyard, and Pape Nikolaus read the burial prayers and set him in the ground beside other infants, the soil tamped down and marked with a simple wooden cross.
