#     timing: Adolescence (15-17) intensifying in young adulthood (18-22)
#     trait: Neuroticism (92nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Supports upward mobility and academic ambition; also contributes
#       to religious change and subtle friction with family expectations.
#     scene: In college she seeks out books/podcasts in English and Tamil on psychology
#       and careers, experiments with new study methods, and becomes more questioning
#       about rituals and 'why we do things.'
#     timing: Young adulthood (18-22)
#     trait: Openness (92nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Maintains harmony and social support, but increases vulnerability
#       to coercion and to being overburdened with requests.
#     scene: She mediates roommate disagreements, avoids public confrontation, and tends
#       to accommodate others even when uncomfortable—later regretting not asserting
#       boundaries sooner with the acquaintance who harmed her.
#     timing: Teen years through young adulthood (16-22)
#     trait: Agreeableness (88th percentile)
#   - consequence: Earns trust with teachers/mentors; sometimes loses opportunities
#       that peers gain through nepotism or bending rules.
#     scene: She refuses to use 'shortcut' unfair practices (cheating, bribery for certificates),
#       insists on paying shared expenses accurately, and is uncomfortable with exaggerating
#       achievements on social media.
#     timing: Adolescence to early adulthood (15-25)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (92nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Protects her from some risky social scenes but can increase isolation,
#       especially during COVID and after the assault.
#     scene: Prefers one close friend or small groups, avoids loud college events, and
#       keeps her social circle tight; on buses/markets she appears reserved and keeps
#       to herself.
#     timing: All phases, most visible in young adulthood (18-25)
#     trait: Lower Extraversion (40th percentile)
#   - consequence: Strong academic performance and upward mobility trajectory; able
#       to navigate bureaucracy (police complaint for phone theft, college administration)
#       even when stressed.
#     scene: Keeps structured study schedules, makes detailed notes, and plans credential

#     trait: Conscientiousness (65th percentile) + Intelligence (77th percentile)
#   - consequence: Distress remains real but contained; avoids seeking formal mental
#       health care due to stigma and time constraints.
#     scene: Despite high worry, she continues functioning—attends classes, completes
#       exams, maintains self-care enough to avoid clinical impairment; uses coping
#       (journaling, routines, selective disclosure to one trusted friend).
#     timing: Especially after sexual violence and during COVID (19-22)
#     trait: No diagnosable mental disorder (subclinical stress)
# number_of_children: '0'
# number_of_siblings: '0'
# occupation: Student / in higher education or professional training (college, postgraduate,
#   competitive exams, nursing/teacher training, etc.)
# religion: Hindu practice mainly on festivals and life-events (Pongal/Deepavali, family
#   ceremonies), little/no daily puja
# structured_incidents:
# - event: While commuting by bus between her rented room and college in a district
#     town, her smartphone was stolen from her bag in a crowded stand/market area; she
#     filed a station complaint but it was never recovered.
#   reasoning: In Tamil Nadu towns in the 2000s–2020s, common risks include phone/chain
#     snatching, petty theft, and fraud/scams; a literate, mobile student is exposed
#     to these contexts.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 20–21 (2021–2022); single event
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: After moving away for studies and going through prolonged stress, she gradually
#     stopped doing most festival rituals and temple visits on her own initiative, keeping
#     only minimal participation when visiting family and treating it more as culture
#     than devotion.
#   reasoning: Festival-only Hindu practice allows for drift toward more secular life
#     or occasionally more devout practice, but outright conversion/apostasy is uncommon
#     in her demographic and region.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 18–22 (2019–2023); sustained period
#   type: religious_change
# - event: A male acquaintance (connected to college/tuition circle) coerced her into
#     unwanted sexual contact during a ride back from an outing, ignoring her refusal
#     and using pressure and physical restraint; she did not report formally due to
#     fear of stigma and escalation.
#   reasoning: For young women in India, sexual violence/coercion (including acquaintance
#     assault) is a significant share of serious victimization; never-married status
#     lowers intimate-partner violence but not risk from acquaintances/strangers, and
#     conditioning on violence makes this a leading subtype.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 19–20 (2020–2021); single event
#   type: sexual_violence

Pavithra was born on May 10, 2001, in Aapakudal near Bhavani in Erode district, in the Indian state of Tamil Nādu. The area was governed by India’s state and national governments, and her world was Tamil-speaking and Hindu in the everyday, local sense—bus stands with small shrines, calendar festivals, and temple loudspeakers mixing with school bells and factory shifts.

Her father, Ravichandran, earned the family’s money through the textile economy that shaped western Tamil Nadu. Some years he worked regular hours; other years he chased orders, moved between units, or took on trading work tied to looms and processing. Her mother, Shanthi, ran the house. They lived as a nuclear family, and Pavithra grew up without siblings. That made the home feel orderly, quieter than the houses she visited where cousins shouted over one another and elders sat watching the street.

Shanthi kept a small pooja corner on a shelf: a framed print of Lakshmi, a small brass lamp, a matchbox, and a tin for kumkum and vibuthi. Pavithra learned the sequence early—wash hands, straighten the picture, light the lamp when her mother did. It happened most reliably around festivals. For Pongal, Shanthi boiled milk until it rose, and Pavithra watched the pot and called out when it spilled over. Deepavali meant new clothes and a sweet box, then visits to relatives. Most days had no ritual beyond a quick forehead mark before school.

As a small child she stayed close to Shanthi in the afternoons, sitting on the cool floor with a slate and chalk, copying letters until her wrist hurt. She spoke Tamil at home and picked up English in school through the routines of reciting and copying. She liked workbooks with neat margins. When a page tore, she taped it instead of ripping it out. Ravichandran came home smelling of dust and dye. Sometimes he was relaxed and brought fruit from the market. Sometimes he counted cash at the table, jaw tight, and spoke in short sentences.

She grew tall early. In school photos she stood near the back row, chin lifted to fit into the frame. Teachers put her in charge of collecting notebooks. She enjoyed that small authority and the clean stack of papers, corners aligned. At home she kept her textbooks wrapped in brown paper covers and wrote her name in careful capital letters.

By the time she reached adolescence, the heat and water worries of the region had become part of routine. Summers brought days when taps ran slow or stopped, and Shanthi stored water in buckets and a drum, measuring out what was needed for cooking and bathing. Pavithra learned to take quick baths and to wash her uniform with minimal water, so it would dry fast on the terrace. She disliked the feeling of sweat sticking to her forearms while studying, so she sat near the fan and timed her hardest subjects for the cooler evening.

Late 2016 hit their household in a way Pavithra could see. Ravichandran’s work depended on cash transactions and small payments moving through many hands. After demonetisation, he came home angry and tired, talking about customers who delayed and workers who demanded wages. Shanthi began buying fewer extras. Pavithra stopped asking for small treats and watched her mother switch to cheaper brands without comment. She responded by studying harder. She made schedules with headings in English and Tamil and used a ruler to draw lines. When she finished a chapter, she ticked it off in pen.

In late 2018, Cyclone Gaja’s wider effects reached them through outages and disruption. The power went off repeatedly. School announcements changed. Ravichandran worried about deliveries and travel. Pavithra sat by the window in the dim light and read until the page blurred. When the current returned, she charged her phone and power bank immediately and scolded herself for forgetting once.

She left Erode district in mid 2019 to study in another Tamil Nadu district town that was not a major metro. The move was small on a map and large in daily life. She stayed in a women’s hostel first, then shifted to a rented room with strict rules and a warden who checked entry times. Her days ran by the bus timetable. She carried her documents in a plastic folder: Aadhaar card copy, college ID, photos, receipts. She liked the feeling of having them ready.

In college she kept her circle narrow. One roommate, Muthulakshmi, became her steady friend. They shared morning tea from a stall near the stop, joked quietly about lecturers who repeated the same notes, and compared exam dates. Muthulakshmi teased Pavithra for packing snacks like a mother—roasted peanuts, a banana, a steel bottle of water—then borrowed them anyway. Pavithra laughed, then insisted on washing the bottle herself.

The pandemic hit during her first year away. In 2020, classes moved online and then back and forth with restrictions. Pavithra spent months moving between her parents’ home and the rented room depending on rules and transport. The uncertainty grated on her. She checked notices repeatedly, refreshed group messages, and lay awake replaying small mistakes: a missed assignment upload, a late reply to a lecturer, an overlooked form. Shanthi told her to pray when she was restless. Pavithra nodded and did not argue, but she stopped feeling that the temple or a lamp could steady her. The practices became something she performed when she returned home—standing for aarti during a festival, eating prasad from a banana leaf—then leaving behind again.

In 2020, when restrictions eased briefly, an acquaintance from her tuition circle, Karthik, offered to drop her back after an outing with others. The ride ended with him turning off onto a quieter road and pressing himself on her while she told him to stop. He held her wrists and kept talking as if her refusal was part of a negotiation. She froze, then fought to get away and returned shaken and furious. She told no one in her family. In her mind she ran through what would happen—questions, blame, calls to relatives, her name moving through the neighborhood. She told Muthulakshmi later, in a clipped description, leaving out details until her friend asked directly. After that Pavithra changed her routes, avoided being alone with men she did not trust, and kept her phone location shared with Muthulakshmi when commuting.

By 2021 she was back in the district town more consistently. The bus stands were crowded again. One evening in 2022, at a market-side stop, someone slipped a hand into her bag and took her smartphone. She noticed when the weight felt wrong. She stood rigid in the crowd, then pushed through to look down near the curb, as if it had fallen. It hadn’t. She went to the police station and gave a complaint. Constable Subramani wrote it down without looking up much. The phone never returned. Pavithra moved her SIM, reset passwords, and learned to keep essential numbers on paper and in cloud storage. After that, she carried less cash and relied more on UPI, tapping quickly and checking twice before confirming.

Her religious life changed in the same years, quietly. She stopped going to temple on her own. She did not fast. She kept a small photo of Lakshmi in her wallet because Shanthi had placed it there, but she treated it like a family habit, not a protection. When she went home for Pongal or Deepavali, she helped Shanthi as before—cutting vegetables, folding sarees, visiting relatives—but she avoided long temple queues and slipped out of discussions about vows and astrology. Mrs. Vanitha, a lecturer she trusted, spoke once about belief as personal and private, and Pavithra carried that sentence around like a permit.

By 2024 she was in the last stretch of training, pushing toward stable work and the kind of life her parents called “settled.” Ravichandran still rode the ups and downs of textile demand, but her education and English gave her better options than the factory floor. She kept spreadsheets of fees and deadlines, arranged certificates in order, and rehearsed interview answers in a low voice while walking. She stayed unmarried. Proposals came through relatives, and Shanthi mentioned them carefully, watching Pavithra’s face. Pavithra listened, asked for details, then returned to her books.

In late 2025, she lives in that district town in a modest rented room, close enough to reach campus by bus without changing routes. She wakes early, makes instant coffee, and reads notes at the small table by the window before the street grows loud. Her phone is backed up. Her documents sit in a labeled folder. On weekends she meets Muthulakshmi for dosa and sambar at a familiar place near the stand, and they trade small complaints about crowds, deadlines, and the price of everything, then laugh at a joke they heard in class. She calls Shanthi most evenings, answers Ravichandran’s practical questions, and keeps moving toward the life she is building.
