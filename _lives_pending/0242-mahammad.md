#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Stability and predictability in management, but missed opportunities
#       and friction with younger men attracted to town ideas and Russian administrative
#       innovations.
#     scene: He dismisses novel farming suggestions (new crop rotations, unfamiliar
#       tools) and insists on 'how it’s always been done,' preferring tried routes,
#       familiar tenants, and established rituals.
#     timing: Adolescence through adulthood (ages ~12-30)
#     trait: Very low Openness (11th percentile)
#   - consequence: Seen as controlled and serious, but sometimes interpreted as coldness;
#       weaker informal alliances compared to more sociable notables.
#     scene: At weddings and market gatherings he stays near a few trusted men, speaks
#       briefly, and leaves early; he delegates public bargaining when possible and
#       prefers written/quiet arrangements.
#     timing: Young adulthood onward (ages ~18-30)
#     trait: Low Extraversion (30th percentile)
#   - consequence: Material benefit and ability to maintain appearances, but lingering
#       resentment among tenants and vulnerability when his patron dies and rivals scrutinize
#       accounts.
#     scene: He is comfortable taking a 'manager’s cut' (extra grain, a lamb, or small
#       fees) and pressuring dependents, rationalizing it as due to his position and
#       the risks he takes traveling.
#     timing: Adult working years (ages ~20-30)
#     trait: Low Honesty-Humility (18th percentile)
#   - consequence: Competence as an intermediary/estate manager despite stigma; keeps
#       him employed and useful within the kin hierarchy.
#     scene: He can follow Russian-style paperwork requirements enough to keep basic
#       tallies and use Persian phrases in formal petitions; he learns which officials
#       to approach and what wording avoids trouble.
#     timing: Late adolescence through adulthood (ages ~15-30)
#     trait: High Intelligence (67th percentile)
#   - consequence: Facilitates marriage into a respectable family and smoother dealings,
#       but also draws envy and sharper policing of his reputation.
#     scene: Women and men remark on his looks; elders see him as a valuable marriage
#       prospect despite doubts about birth, while rivals gossip that he 'wins favor'
#       too easily.

#     stumbled on a rough winter track and threw him; he suffered a badly sprained knee
#     and bruised ribs that kept him largely housebound and unable to ride or supervise
#     work directly for several weeks.
#   reasoning: As a rural estate manager who traveled and worked around horses, carts,
#     livestock, tools, and occasional construction/field activity, a major injury with
#     prolonged recovery was a common route to a serious but survivable health event
#     by age 30.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 23 (late 1851 to early 1852)
#   type: serious_accident
# - event: He experienced recurrent bouts of fever and chills each year after late-summer
#     work around lowland pasture and riverine areas near the Caspian, leaving him weak
#     for days at a time and forcing him to delegate estate rounds to a male relative
#     or hired steward.
#   reasoning: Chronic conditions (recurrent malaria/fevers, chronic respiratory disease
#     short of terminal TB, persistent gastrointestinal illness, rheumatic pain) were
#     common and could limit work without immediately killing a young adult in this
#     setting.

Mahammad was born on July 3, 1828, in a village in the Quba district of the Russian Empire’s newly tightened Caucasus administration. His people spoke an Oghuz Turkic vernacular at home and used Persian phrases for polite letters and religious learning. The village prayed as Shi’a Muslims, but Mahammad’s household treated religion as a set of obligations to be met: Ramadan, funerals, marriages, and the occasional visit to the mosque when it suited the family’s standing.

His mother, Gülsüm, raised him in her kin’s compound with her own mother, Sakina, close at hand. The boy learned early where to stand when men spoke, when to keep quiet, and which questions brought sharp looks. The man who helped provide for them, Haji Rahim, moved through the village as a collector and messenger for the district’s routines—receipts, lists, orders, escorts to the town. He never announced Mahammad as his son. Everyone still understood the connection. It gave the child food, clothing, and work later; it also fixed a ceiling over him in public.

The household filled and thinned quickly. Zeynab arrived in 1830, close enough in age that she followed him into the yard and copied his games. During the cholera years of 1831–1833, adults talked about bad water and the danger of crowds. Gülsüm sent Mahammad to draw from a cleaner spring and forbade him from lingering near travelers. The family avoided the busier market days, and when they had to go, they returned quickly, washing hands and faces as soon as they came inside.

Fatma was born in 1832. She died in 1835, small and light, before Mahammad had much language for it. He remembered only the women’s keening and the way his mother’s work became brisk and hard afterward. In 1836 another sister, Khadija, was born, a baby who grew into a child tugging at Gülsüm’s sleeves while Mahammad carried buckets and bundles for her.

Sakina, the grandmother, died in 1841. After that, Gülsüm ran the household without an older woman above her. She kept stores of grain and dried fruit, counted jars of butter and cheese, and oversaw the spinning and weaving. Mahammad did errands and took messages. He liked sitting just inside the shade of the doorway with a bowl of thick yogurt and bread, watching people pass without having to greet them for long.

Two younger brothers came and went too fast. Aghabala was born in 1839 and did not live to be carried outside. Iskandar arrived in 1842 and died in 1844, old enough to speak a few words. Those deaths tightened the family’s attention around Mahammad. He became the only surviving boy among his mother’s children, and that mattered even with the stain of his birth.

Mullah Suleyman taught him to read. The lessons were practical: recognizing letters, sounding out Qur’anic passages, reciting what he understood and repeating what he did not. Mahammad could read aloud from familiar pages and follow a simple written note. He wrote slowly and with effort, his hand stiff, but he could copy a name and a sum. The mullah also passed on Persian phrases used in petitions and polite speech. Mahammad used them later with clerks and elders, with a careful, flat voice that kept him from sounding eager.

He grew into a striking young man. People remarked on it openly, and older women watched him more closely than they watched other boys. He did not enjoy being looked at. When visitors came, he held himself still and spoke in short sentences, then moved away to the storeroom or the stable yard. Zeynab teased him for it, calling him a bride hiding behind curtains, and he answered with a thin smile that made her laugh.

The empire’s rules pressed in as he reached adulthood: more paperwork, more insistence on receipts, more trips to the district center. Haji Rahim used him for errands that required a quick mind and a quiet mouth. In 1846 the district tightened movement during another cholera wave. Markets thinned, roads were watched, and messages became more urgent. Mahammad carried papers in his belt and kept his head down when soldiers or guards questioned him.

In 1847, after a late-summer round to lowland pastures and crossings near the Caspian, he began to shake with fever at night. It returned the next year, and the next. Each time it arrived after the same kind of work—heat, mosquitoes, stagnant water, long days on horseback. He learned to plan his rounds so he could rest afterward. When the chills began, he lay on a felt mat in the warmest corner of the room and drank hot tea sweetened with jam. Gülsüm, efficient as ever, made sure someone else watched the stores and accounts until he could stand.

Marriage repaired parts of his standing. In 1848 he married Nabat, the daughter of a respectable family that accepted a practical arrangement. The wedding followed village custom: visits between households, negotiated gifts, a public meal, women’s ululations, and a contract spoken and witnessed. Mahammad tolerated the ceremony and withdrew as soon as it became too loud, leaving the joking and greetings to others.

Their first son, Ali, was born in 1849. Mahammad held the infant briefly, then handed him back to the women and went outside to speak with a visiting elder about a boundary dispute. He took pride in Ali’s health and in the fact that the child fixed his place in the household more firmly than any spoken promise. He enjoyed sitting with the boy in the early morning, when the yard was still cool, breaking bread into small pieces and letting Ali grab at his fingers.

A daughter, Zahra, was born in 1851 and died the same day. Nabat stayed quiet afterward. Gülsüm spoke to the midwife, Bibi-Peri, in a low voice about timing, about herbs, about keeping the room warm. Mahammad made sure the burial payment was handled and returned to work quickly, as if speed could pin down the household’s respectability.

That winter, late in 1851, he rode between villages to check tenants and collect dues. The track was rough with frozen ruts. His horse stumbled, and he went down hard. The knee swelled and would not take weight. His ribs ached with every breath. For weeks he stayed inside, unable to ride or walk the fields. Rashid, a cousin with a quick tongue, took over the rounds. Rashid brought back sums and stories, each one a reminder that Mahammad’s authority depended on being visible. When Mahammad finally hobbled into the yard with a stick, Rashid grinned and asked if the great manager would now conduct business from a cushion like an old man. Mahammad answered by demanding the ledger and checking every figure, line by line, until Rashid stopped smiling.

Hasan was born in 1853, a year of renewed cholera fear and disrupted travel. Mahammad kept to safer routes and avoided crowded inns, sending hired men when a trip could be postponed. In the mid-1850s, poor harvests tightened grain supplies. Tenants pleaded for delays, and arguments over arrears grew sharper. Mahammad listened with his face still and his hands folded, then insisted on dues in kind—grain, wool, a lamb—enough to keep the stores full and the household’s standing intact. He took small extra portions for himself without discussion, certain it was payment for risk and effort.

Zeynab died in 1854 at twenty-four. Khadija, still a young girl, clung to Gülsüm more tightly after that. Nabat leaned on Zeynab’s help before her death, and without it she relied on Gülsüm and the younger sister for childcare when Mahammad traveled.

Haji Rahim died in 1856. After the funeral, Karbalayi Musa, a senior notable tied by marriage to the family, treated Mahammad with a cooler formality. Mahammad remained useful—he could read enough to follow orders and keep simple tallies, and he knew how to speak to clerks like Ivan Petrov without giving offense—but he no longer had the same protection. He became, in practice, a resident manager under other men’s authority, living with his mother, wife, children, and an older generation above him.

A fourth child, Sakina, was born in 1857 and died the next year. Mahammad blamed no one and spoke little about it. He avoided gatherings where women would ask questions, and when troubled he sat outside near the storeroom, counting sacks and jars in silence until his thoughts steadied.

In the winter of 1858–1859, he developed a hard cough and chest pain. He stayed indoors, wrapped in a wool cloak, drinking hot broth and tea. The illness turned into a severe respiratory infection, and on February 18, 1859, at thirty years old, Mahammad died in his family house.

The men washed his body, wrapped it in a shroud, and carried him to the cemetery outside the village. A mullah recited the funeral prayer, and they placed him in the earth facing the qibla, packing soil down firmly before returning to the compound.
