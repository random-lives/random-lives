# Tina - Example Historical Notes

These are hand-crafted historical notes for Tina (470-498 AD, Papua New Guinea Highlands).

## Notes

- Tina lived about 1,200 years before the sweet potato reached New Guinea. His staple crops would have been taro, banana, and yams—plants cultivated in the highlands for thousands of years. Kuk Swamp, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Western Highlands, preserves evidence of agricultural drainage systems dating back 9,000 years, making New Guinea one of the few places in the world where agriculture developed independently.

- The Trans-New Guinea language family—over 500 languages—likely spread with the population growth that followed taro domestication, roughly 5,000–6,000 years ago. By Tina's time it dominated the highlands, though he spoke a non–Trans-New Guinea language, one of the older minority families that persisted in pockets. The name "Tina" is a placeholder; we cannot know what his community called themselves or him.

- No written records exist from 5th-century New Guinea. Everything known about this period comes from archaeology, linguistics, and ethnographic analogy—reading backward from societies observed in the 19th and 20th centuries. The highlands were among the last major habitable regions on Earth to be contacted by outsiders; Australian colonial patrols did not reach the area until the 1930s.

- The Southern Highlands receive over 3,000 mm of rain annually. On steep slopes, saturated soil becomes unstable; the landslips described in the story are a recurring feature of highland life, destroying gardens and paths without warning.
