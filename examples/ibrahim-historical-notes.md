# Ibrahim Kanneh - Example Historical Notes

These are hand-crafted historical notes for Ibrahim Kanneh (born 2005, Moyamba District, Sierra Leone).

## Notes

- Sierra Leone's civil war (1991–2002) ended three years before Ibrahim's birth. The war killed an estimated 50,000 people and displaced half the population. Moyamba District saw significant fighting; much of Ibrahim's childhood took place amid ongoing reconstruction of schools, clinics, and roads.

- The 2014–2016 West African Ebola epidemic killed nearly 4,000 people in Sierra Leone. Schools closed for nine months. The "no-touch" greeting policy suspended handshakes and embraces nationwide—the awkward distance Ibrahim describes was mandated, not chosen.

- Mende, Ibrahim's first language, is spoken by about 30% of Sierra Leoneans, concentrated in the south and east. Krio—an English-based creole that developed among freed slaves resettled in Freetown in the late 18th century—serves as the national lingua franca. English is the official language and medium of school instruction, but fluency varies sharply; Ibrahim's limited literacy despite years of schooling reflects a common pattern in rural areas where teachers are scarce and attendance irregular.

- About 77% of Sierra Leoneans are Muslim, with the remainder mostly Christian. The two communities coexist with relatively little conflict; intermarriage is common, and religious identity often matters less than ethnic or regional ties.

- Sierra Leone's GDP per capita is roughly $500—among the lowest in the world. Ibrahim, as a young rural smallholder who can occasionally turn a profit and bring cash home, is not among the poorest Sierra Leoneans, but his life would register as extreme poverty by global standards.
