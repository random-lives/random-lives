# Push Skill

When committing and pushing changes, always follow this sequence:

1. `git add .` - Stage all changes
2. `git commit -m "descriptive message"` - Commit with a clear message describing what changed
3. `git push` - Push to remote

Do all three steps. Don't ask for confirmation between steps.
