*Draft — to be written*

The commonly cited figure is around 117 billion, originating from a 1995 Population Reference Bureau article and subsequent updates. This estimate assumes birth rates that are difficult to reconcile with the historical demographic literature.

A more defensible estimate is around 70 billion.

## The PRB estimate

TODO: Explain the PRB methodology and its assumptions

## Problems with high estimates

TODO: Why the assumed birth rates are too high

## A revised estimate

TODO: Walk through a more careful calculation

## What this means for Random Lives

TODO: How this affects the sampling weights in the project
