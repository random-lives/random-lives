# About Random Lives

This website presents biographical stories of randomly sampled people from across all of human history, weighted by actual birth numbers.

## The Project

The Random Lives project aims to give an accurate statistical picture of human experience by:

- Sampling birth years from 200,000 BCE to present, weighted by historical population data
- Generating demographics based on time period and location
- Simulating lifespans using historical mortality data
- Creating detailed biographical narratives

## Methodology

Each person's story is generated through a multi-step process:

1. **Random sampling** of birth year weighted by historical birth rates
2. **Geographic placement** using historical population distribution data
3. **Demographic generation** based on era-appropriate historical records
4. **Lifespan simulation** using mortality models specific to time and place
5. **Narrative creation** that reflects the statistical realities of their time

The sampling is truly random and weighted by birth rates, which means the collection accurately reflects historical patterns: many infant deaths, concentration in high-population eras and regions, and the predominance of agricultural lifestyles throughout most of human history.

## Data Sources
