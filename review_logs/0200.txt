Review of `0200-kira.md` is complete.

## Summary

**Story reviewed:** `_lives_pending/0200-kira.md`

**Issues found and fixed:**
1. **[Pseudosociological]** "sent goods through kin" → "sent goods through relatives"
2. **[Pseudosociological]** "Hali, an older woman from Sani's kin" → "Hali, Sani's mother" (debug indicated she was maternal grandmother)
3. **[Figurative]** "moved like another adult" → "worked as another adult" (removed simile)

**No issues with:**
- Death coverage: Tali's death (same year) happened after Kira died at 5 days old, so correctly not mentioned
- Juna's death (older brother who died at 2) correctly noted as having occurred before Kira's birth
- Family structure is clear and well-introduced
- Chronology is consistent
- No anachronisms detected
- Appropriate length for an infant story (4 short paragraphs)
