Review complete for **0163-rahma**.

**Summary of issues found and fixed:**

1. **[Missing trait visibility]** Low Honesty-Humility (22nd percentile) was not visible in the narrative. Added: "Sometimes she claimed Amina's ideas as her own. She exaggerated when chores went undone, blaming anyone nearby."

2. **[Missing character introduction]** Mama Halima (household worker/nanny) appeared at the end serving tea without any prior introduction. Added her earlier: "Mama Halima cooked and watched the house when both parents worked."

3. **[Vague illness]** "fell seriously ill" was too vague for a story set in a specific context (Dar es Salaam, rainy season 2023, vector-borne disease outbreak). Changed to "caught dengue fever" which is documented in the region.

4. **[Awkward transition]** "Now it's late 2025" was awkward and outdated. Changed to "Now it is early 2026."

The story was otherwise well-structured with good trait visibility for Intelligence (97th), low Openness (3rd), low Agreeableness (10th), high Extraversion (81st), and high Conscientiousness (77th). All family deaths (Yahya's infant death) were properly mentioned.
