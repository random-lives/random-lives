## Review Summary: 0197-yana

**Issues found:**
1. **[Missing death - CRITICAL]** Nari (mother) dies in -3169 when Yana is 36, but the final paragraph had "Nari tried to give her salted water" when Yana dies at 37. This was a significant error since Nari should have been dead by then.
2. **[Pseudosociological "kin"]** Three instances of "kin" that should use more concrete language: "help kin in a nearby settlement", "His kin kept her", "her kin placed her body"

**Changes made:**
- Added new paragraph for Nari's death at age 36: "In her thirty-sixth year, Nari fell ill and did not recover. Yana tended her as she had tended others, bringing water and porridge, sitting through the long nights. When Nari died, they buried her beside Ema and the infant graves, and Yana poured the libation herself."
- Changed caregiver in final illness from "Nari" to "Bera's wife" since Nari is now dead
- "help kin" → "help relatives"
- "His kin kept her" → "His family kept her"  
- "her kin placed her body" → "her family placed her body"

The story otherwise handled the family structure well - all four infant sibling deaths were mentioned, grandmother Ema's death was included, and the chronology was sound.
