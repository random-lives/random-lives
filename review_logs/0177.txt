Review of **0177-mādhav** is complete.

## Summary

**Story**: Mādhav, infant boy born February 10, 1337 in Bankura, Bengal (modern West Bengal, India). Died May 11, 1337 at 3 months old from diarrheal disease.

**Issues found**: 1
- **Anachronism**: The narrative incorrectly stated the region was "under the revenue reach of the Bengal Sultanate" in 1337. The Bengal Sultanate wasn't established until 1342. In 1337, the Bankura region was actually controlled by the Hindu Malla kings of Bishnupur, who maintained independence from Muslim rule throughout this period. The Delhi Sultanate (under Muhammad bin Tughluq) had nominal claims over Bengal but little effective control in this western frontier zone.

**Changes made**: 
- Corrected the political context in the opening sentence to accurately reflect the Malla dynasty's local authority and the Delhi Sultanate's distant nominal claim.

The rest of the story was clean:
- Family structure correct (one deceased older sister mentioned appropriately)
- No deaths to cover during protagonist's lifetime
- No pseudosociological language ("kin")
- No vague hedging (" or ")
- Plain, direct prose with no figurative language
- Chronology clear and accurate
