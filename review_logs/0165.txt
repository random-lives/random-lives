The review of story 0165-veko.md is complete.

## Summary

**Story reviewed:** `_lives_pending/0165-veko.md` - Veko, a Forest Nenets man born in 1897 in the West Siberian taiga, who died by suicide in 1939 at age 41.

**Issues found:**
1. **Missing sibling death** - Nado (born and died 1912) was completely missing from the narrative. The story jumped from Tyaro (1909) to Kardo (1915) without mentioning this infant death.
2. **Pseudosociological "kin" language** - "His kin cut him down" at the suicide discovery scene should use specific people.

**Changes made:**
1. Added Nado's birth and death in the paragraph about Tyaro: "Nado, another brother, was born in 1912 and died before he could crawl."
2. Changed "His kin cut him down" → "Nyarko and Nyanya cut him down" (brother and wife, the people most likely to have found him)

**Note:** This is a well-written story overall. The narrative handles the suicide sensitively and directly. All major deaths (parents, uncle, children, sister Mando) are properly covered. The extreme traits (high agreeableness, high honesty-humility, tall stature) are clearly visible through concrete actions. The bisexual orientation, per the debug plan, appropriately remains offstage given the era and cultural context.
