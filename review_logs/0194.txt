Review complete for **0194-wanyan-helibo**.

**Summary of Issues Found:**
1. **Missing sibling birth**: Wanyan Ledu (F) born 1196 was never mentioned in the narrative
2. **Pseudosociological language**: Five instances of "kin" that needed to be replaced with plain language ("families", "family", or specific people)

**Changes Made:**
- Added Ledu's birth in 1196 after the infant deaths, establishing her as a surviving younger sister
- Changed "kin groups" → "families"
- Changed "Zongbi's kin" → "Zongbi's family"
- Changed "her kin warned her away" → "her family warned her away"
- Changed "along kin lines" → "among families"
- Changed "His kin recovered the body" → "Loushi and his sisters recovered the body"

The story is otherwise well-constructed with good coverage of family deaths (infant siblings Hulie and Alin, grandmother Shehu, infant son Dumu), clear chronology, and no hedging/vagueness issues.
