The review is complete. The story is well-written overall with good characterization of Zhao Shun's anxiety disorder, low conscientiousness, high agreeableness, and low openness traits. The chronology now flows correctly, and all family deaths are properly covered.

**Summary of review for 0118-zhao-shun:**

**Issues found and fixed:**
1. "her kin" → "her brother" (pseudosociological language)
2. Moved thefts paragraph to correct chronological position (before Liu Shi's death in 184)
3. Removed "Shun's anxiety tightened into habit" (abstract AI-slop phrase)
4. Changed redundant "At forty-one, in 184" → "That same year" to avoid repeating the year

The story is otherwise solid - all family deaths (father Zhao Qiu 176, mother Liu Shi 184, infant Zhao Lan 165, toddler Zhao Yong 168) are mentioned, the family structure is clear, and the narrative shows personality traits through concrete actions rather than telling.
