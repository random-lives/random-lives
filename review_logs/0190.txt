Review complete for story 0190-person-0190-unnamed.

**Summary of review:**

**Issues found:**
1. **CRITICAL - Naming error**: The `naming_category` in debug data is "unnamed" (died before naming ceremony), but the narrative incorrectly gave the baby the name "Nandana." This name also conflicted with a younger sibling born in 1210.
2. **Clarity**: The phrase "called Nandana in the moment, for a hopeful name" was awkward and unclear.

**Changes made:**
- Removed the name and rewrote the final paragraph to show the baby died unnamed
- Added concrete details about the birth asphyxia (never cried, stayed limp and blue) that connect better to the cause of death
- Added "unnamed" explicitly to make clear this baby died before any naming ceremony could occur

The rest of the story was well-constructed:
- Family structure properly introduced with ages and roles
- Dead siblings correctly separated (Sītā died 1192, Mallikā died 1199 - both before protagonist's birth)
- Living siblings introduced with appropriate context
- Chronology clear and consistent
- No figurative language or AI-slop phrases
- Historical context appropriate for 1201 Mithila region
