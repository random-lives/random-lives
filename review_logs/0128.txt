**Review complete for 0128-pini.**

This is a well-written infant story (age 1) set in 1271-1272 Assam, India. The narrative:

- Properly introduces all three siblings with their birth and death years
- Correctly shows Bina (eldest sister, age 16) as alive at Pini's birth and dying later in 1271
- Clearly separates Dimi and Sali as having died before Pini's birth
- Mentions both parents (Boro and Guma) appropriately
- Has no "kin" language, no figurative language, no vague hedging
- Includes appropriate historical/cultural context (Brahmaputra valley, Tibeto-Burman language, syncretic religious practice)
- Death from diarrheal disease during weaning is historically accurate for the era

No changes needed.
