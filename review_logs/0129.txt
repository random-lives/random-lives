**Review Summary for 0129-mitrā:**

**Issues found:**
1. Missing death: Bhadrā (paternal grandmother, died 212) was never mentioned despite being established as a harsh disciplinarian
2. Four instances of pseudosociological "kin" language
3. Chronology issue: paragraphs jumped back in time (224 → 223 → 223)

**Changes made:**
- Added Bhadrā's death in 212: "Bhadrā died that year, before the marriage negotiations ended."
- Fixed 4 "kin" → "family/relatives" substitutions
- Reorganized chronology to flow correctly: weak monsoon of 223 → travelers speaking of changes → Somaśiri's death in 224 → debt crisis in 224-225
