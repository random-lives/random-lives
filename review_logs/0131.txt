**Review Summary for 0131-kalis:**

**Issues found:**
1. Papas (paternal grandfather) dies 357 BC - narrative showed him falling ill at age 16 and Kalis caring for him, but never stated Papas died
2. Three younger siblings who died as infants during Kalis's childhood (Batas 371 BC, Tatis 369 BC, Zanis 367 BC) were not mentioned
3. "His kin recovered his body" - pseudosociological language

**Changes made:**
- Added Papas's death: "Papas died in Kalis's eighteenth year, still feeble, unable to sit up at the end."
- Added the three infant deaths and integrated Manis/Taras births into the childhood section: "Two years after Kalis, Brenis bore Manis, a boy who lived. But the deaths continued: Batas in Kalis's fourth year, Tatis in his sixth, Zanis in his eighth. Each time the small bundle was carried out past the gardens, and Brenis added another name to her offerings at the coals. The youngest, Taras, was born when Kalis was ten, and he survived."
- Changed "His kin" → "His family"
