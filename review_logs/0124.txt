**Review complete for 0124-bald.**

The story is clean with no issues found:
- **Death coverage**: All caretakers (Freda, Erman, Hildi) have null death_year, and all three siblings were born after Bald's death in 455 AD - no missing deaths
- **Family structure**: Clear introduction of mother Freda (unfree domestic laborer), Hildi (older female kin/grandmother), and the estate head Erman; father's absence explicitly addressed
- **Chronology**: Narrative flows correctly from birth through toddlerhood to death at age 2
- **No pseudosociological "kin" language**
- **No vague hedging**
- **No figurative language**
- **Trait visibility**: High extraversion (98th percentile) shown through running to greet people, shouting, wanting faces close; high openness shown through exploration
- **Historical accuracy**: 5th century Denmark setting with West/North Germanic language contact, thrall status, longhouse, and Germanic ritual practices all appropriate
