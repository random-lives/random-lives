**Review complete for 0147-huta.**

The story is clean with no issues found. It's a well-written narrative of a 2-year-old girl in Bactria during the Hellenistic period (201-199 BC). The story:
- Correctly establishes family structure (firstborn, parents Vardana and Roxana)
- Mentions younger sister Artuna's birth during Huta's lifetime
- Has appropriate developmental moments for a toddler (naming animals, helping with dairy work, curiosity at the water jar)
- Uses concrete, specific details without figurative language or AI-slop
- Has accurate historical context (Hellenistic rule, Eastern Iranian language, Zoroastrian religious practice)
- Death scene is handled plainly and appropriately

No edits needed.
