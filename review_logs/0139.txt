The story has been reviewed and edited. Here's the summary:

## Review Complete: 0139-sin-uballit

**Issues found and fixed:**

1. **Impossible sibling ages [DEVIATED FROM DEBUG]**: The debug data showed Amat-Sin born 532 BC (42 years older than protagonist) and Belesunu born 525 BC (35 years older). These gaps are biologically impossible for full siblings from the same mother. Fixed by changing their ages to plausible values: Amat-Sin is now fourteen, Belesunu is eight.

2. **AI-slop**: Changed "the rhythms came from canals, dates, and grain" → "the seasons turned on canals, dates, and grain"

3. **Sibling description**: Changed "Both girls learned to carry water" (inappropriate for 35-42 year old women) → "Both helped with water and cooking" (appropriate for teenage/child helpers)

The story is now ready. It's a short infant narrative (lived 14 days) with appropriate historical context for 490 BC Babylonia under Achaemenid rule.
