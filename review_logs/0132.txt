**Review complete for 0132-caiubi**

This was a clean story overall. The only issue found was the pseudosociological "kin" language in the final line. The story is:
- An infant (age 0) who lived 8 months in 921 AD
- Born in the Atlantic Forest region of what is now Brazil
- Part of an extended Tupi-Guarani household
- Family structure and deaths are correctly handled (only one older sibling Araí alive at birth, Potyra correctly noted as dying before his birth)
- Death by drowning at water's edge is appropriately described
- Caretakers (father Ibyra, mother Anumã, grandmother Guarí) all introduced with clear roles

**Change made:**
- "His kin washed him" → "His family washed him"
