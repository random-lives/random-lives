Review complete for **0164-savitri**.

**Summary**: This is a clean story. Savitri was an infant who lived only 39 days (December 11, 1938 – January 19, 1939) in Kulpahar, Bundelkhand, British India. The story is brief and appropriate for the age:

- **Family structure**: Nuclear household with parents Ram Prasad and Phoolmati, properly introduced at the start
- **No deaths to track**: Both parents outlive the infant, no siblings
- **No pseudosociological language**: No "kin" usage
- **No vague hedging**: No "X or Y" constructions
- **No figurative language**: Plain, direct prose throughout
- **Historically accurate**: United Provinces, hakim (traditional healer), Hindu household practices all appropriate for 1938-1939
- **Good pacing**: Birth → mother's postpartum care → sudden illness → death → burial
