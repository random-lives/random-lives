The review is complete.

**Summary of review for 0149-aditya:**

**Issues found:**
- One developmental implausibility: The narrative claimed a 4-year-old could "read and write Marathi easily" and "copy prayers from a small notebook," which is too advanced for this age.

**Changes made:**
- Changed the literacy description to age-appropriate: "Aditya recognizes a few Marathi letters and can trace his name" instead of fluent reading/writing.

**No issues with:**
- Death coverage (all family members alive)
- "Kin" language (none found)
- Vague hedging (none found)
- Younger sibling births (Vedant's 2024 birth is mentioned)
- Figurative language (none found)
- Chronology (events flow correctly)
- Trait visibility (extreme agreeableness shown well through concrete actions)
