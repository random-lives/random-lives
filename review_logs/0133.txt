Review of **0133-phuntsok** is complete.

**Summary of changes:**
1. **Added Tsering's death** - The oldest brother died in 1869 (same year as Phuntsok) but this was missing from the narrative. Added: "In autumn 1869, Tsering died, weakened by a lung illness."

2. **Fixed timeline confusion** - The original "Snow came early the next year. In autumn 1869..." was confusing because early snow and autumn 1869 seemed disconnected. Rewrote to: "The following winter was harsh. In autumn 1869, Tsering died... Weeks later, Phuntsok developed..." which creates a clear sequence: harsh winter → Tsering's death in autumn → Phuntsok's illness weeks later.

The story is otherwise well-structured with clear family introductions, appropriate handling of the implausible sibling ages (calling Tsering "an elder herdsman" rather than specifying impossible ages), and no pseudosociological language or figurative language issues.
