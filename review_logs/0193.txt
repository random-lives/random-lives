Review of 0193-aude is complete.

**Summary:**

Story 0193-aude (Aude, 1231-1307, rural France) was a well-written story with only minor issues:

**Issues found and fixed:**
1. **[Pseudosociological]** "kin and neighbors" → "both families" 
2. **[Pseudosociological]** "kin land" → "her father's land"
3. **[Grammar]** "washed and rewashing" → "washed and rewashed"

**No issues with:**
- Family structure: All siblings (Azalaïs, Pons) and children (Raimon, Pons, Bernat junior, Agnès) properly introduced
- Death coverage: All deaths during Aude's lifetime mentioned (father 1268, mother 1276, sister 1253, brother 1241, son Raimon 1254, infant son Pons 1253, adult son Bernat junior 1296)
- Chronology: Events flow in proper temporal order
- Trait visibility: Low conscientiousness (14th percentile) and high agreeableness (85th percentile) both clearly visible in behavior
- Low physical attractiveness (5th percentile) addressed via "treated as 'useful' rather than admired"
