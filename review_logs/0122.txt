Review of **0122-ali** complete.

**Summary:**
- **Issues found:** One pseudosociological "kin" usage
- **Changes made:** "in a compound shared with kin" → "in a compound shared with Yusuf's family"

This was a clean infant story. The family structure was well-handled (both siblings who died before Ali's birth were properly mentioned as buried infants), the chronology was clear, no figurative language or AI-slop, and all caretakers were properly introduced. The only issue was the generic "kin" which I replaced with a more concrete reference to Yusuf's family.
