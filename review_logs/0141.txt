The review is complete. Let me provide a summary:

## Review Summary: 0141-bhadrā

**Issues found:**
1. **Missing character**: Datta (paternal grandfather) was listed as a key caretaker with a significant narrative role—providing supervision, storytelling, and indulgent moments with Bhadrā—but was completely absent from the narrative.
2. **Pseudosociological language**: "joint household" used in line 250.

**Changes made:**
1. Changed "father's joint household under his parents' authority" → "father's household, shared with his parents" to make the household composition concrete without jargon.
2. Added Datta in the second paragraph with two mentions:
   - "Her husband Datta had grown too stiff for heavy work but still held household authority and told stories to children who sat near him."
   - "Datta let her stay and watch the craft work when she sat quietly" - this reflects the debug data's note that he "lets Bhadrā listen to travelers or watch craft work."

The story otherwise had good coverage of:
- All four siblings (Sirimati, Nanda's birth/death, Dhamma, Rohinī's birth/death)
- The violence incident at age 6
- The death scene with appropriate detail
- Named characters from the debug data (Sumanā the caravan woman, Yasā the midwife)
