Review complete for **0187-munyaneza**.

**Summary:**
- **Story**: Munyaneza, born September 3, 1818 in Rwanda, died September 5, 1818 (age 0, lived 2 days) from neonatal infection/sepsis
- **Issues found**: None
- **Changes made**: None

This is a well-written infant story. The narrative:
- Correctly establishes the Kingdom of Rwanda context in 1818
- Properly introduces the two living older brothers (Karemera, age 10; Sebatware, age 4)
- Appropriately separates siblings who died before birth (Rwabukumba and Nyirampuhwe)
- Handles the brief illness and death with appropriate gravity
- Falls within the expected word count range for infant stories (150-300 words)
- Contains no pseudosociological language, figurative phrases, vague hedging, or AI-slop
