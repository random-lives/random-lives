## Review Summary: 0111-li-shi

**Issues found and fixed:**

1. **Missing deaths (4):**
   - Father Li De (dies 1152) - added
   - Mother Madam Li (dies 1168) - added
   - Brother Li Shun (dies 1161) - added
   - Brother Li Qiang (dies 1160) - added

2. **Missing sibling introductions:**
   - Li Shun (eldest surviving brother, born 1114) - added to childhood section
   - Li Yong (younger brother, born 1127) - added birth
   - Li Jiu (younger brother, born 1129, dies in infancy) - added

3. **Vague hedging:**
   - "grain and fodder" → "grain"

4. **Chronology fix:**
   - Grandmother's death (1146) was appearing before the marriage (1143) in the original narrative. Reordered so marriage comes first, then grandmother's death placed with the second daughter's death (both 1146).
