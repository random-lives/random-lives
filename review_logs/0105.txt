The review of **0105-frances-mary** is complete.

## Summary

**Story**: Frances Mary, born 1911 in Wisconsin, died 1974 at age 63. Second of eight children in a working-class Catholic farm family. Migrated to a larger city during the Depression, worked service/retail jobs, married Walter, had three children (one died in infancy). Experienced religious drift mid-life.

**Issues found**: Only two minor issues:
1. "household rhythms" — mild AI-pattern phrase
2. "stayed lodged in her" — slightly figurative

**Changes made**:
- Changed "knew the household rhythms" → "knew the household routines"
- Changed "The infant death stayed lodged in her" → "The infant death stayed with her"

**Overall assessment**: This is a well-crafted story. All deaths during Frances's lifetime are properly covered (Dorothy 1937, Robert 1939, Evelyn 1948, Patrick 1958, Katherine 1966). The seven siblings are introduced clearly in birth order. Chronology flows smoothly. No pseudosociological "kin" language in the narrative. No vague hedging or anachronisms. The low conscientiousness trait manifests clearly through multiple scenes (forgetfulness, unfinished tasks, the till-skimming). The story captures a 20th-century American Catholic woman's life with historical accuracy for Wisconsin, the 1918 flu, the Depression, WWII, and Vatican II.
