The review is complete. Let me provide a summary of what was found and fixed:

## Review Complete: 0156-otsuru

**Issues found:**
1. **Missing death** - Omasa (mother) dies 1680 - not mentioned
2. **Missing death** - Oba Kiyo (aunt) dies 1672 - not mentioned (same year as marriage)  
3. **Missing death** - Otsune (sister) dies 1719 - death not mentioned despite appearing in narrative
4. **Pseudosociological** - "natal kin connection" used "kin"
5. **Clarity** - "bound to an adult child's household through earlier marriage arrangements and affinal ties" was unclear given all her children died

**Changes made:**
- Added Omasa's death (1680) after Oito's birth and before her death
- Added Oba Kiyo's death (1672) connected to Otsuru's marriage
- Added Otsune's death (1719) between Oshino's death (1713) and Heisuke's death (1726)
- Changed "natal kin connection" → "connection to her natal family"
- Replaced the confusing "affinal ties" explanation with a concrete explanation: Takesaburō had married before dying, and his widow remarried within the village while keeping her mother-in-law Otsuru
