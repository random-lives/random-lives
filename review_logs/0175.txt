## 0175-akwele Review Summary

**Issues found:**
1. **Missing death: Esi** - Sister died in 1974 at age 7 but narrative only showed her alive
2. **Missing death: Mother Afi** - Died in 1996 but never mentioned after 1988
3. **Sibling introduction unclear** - Listed vaguely without establishing birth years; some siblings (Esi, Adjoa) were missing from the list entirely
4. **Chronology issue** - Thefts paragraph jumped backward in time (1988, 1992) after discussing the 1990s

**Changes made:**
- Rewrote sibling introduction to list all nine siblings by name with birth years and note infant deaths
- Added Esi's death in 1974 with appropriate context
- Added mother Afi's death in 1996
- Fixed thefts paragraph chronology by generalizing the time references
