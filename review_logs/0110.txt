**Review complete for 0110-hafsa.**

The story is clean - no issues found. This is a well-crafted infant death narrative that:
- Properly introduces the family structure (parents, living siblings with ages/roles, deceased siblings before birth)
- Uses plain, direct prose without figurative language or AI-slop
- Has no pseudosociological "kin" language
- Contains no vague hedging
- Is historically appropriate for 14th-century Anatolian Muslim households
- Correctly names the infant (naming_category: attested)

The story effectively conveys the brevity of Hafsa's life while giving appropriate context about the household and the parents' history of child loss.
