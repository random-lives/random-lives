Review complete for **0119-gopala**.

**Summary:**
- This is an infant story (lived 2 days) set in 269 BC in the lower Ganges plain during the Mauryan Empire
- Family structure is clear: parents (Rudda, Lila), grandparents (Dhani, Bharu), and prior deceased sibling (Kanti)
- Only one minor issue found: "grave memory inside the house" was slightly poetic; changed to "carried grief"
- No missing deaths (older sibling Kanti died before Gopala's birth, correctly noted; younger siblings born after Gopala's death)
- No "kin" language, no vague hedging, no anachronisms
- Historical context (Mauryan officials, Vedic rites to Agni) is appropriate for the era
