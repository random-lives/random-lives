Review complete for **0196-pranavi.md**.

**Summary:**
- This is a short infant story (baby died at 7 months)
- Family structure is correct: older brother Karthik (born 2015) properly introduced; younger sister Anvika (born 2021) correctly not mentioned since she was born after Pranavi's death
- No family deaths to cover during the narrative period
- One minor edit: "when breastfeeds failed" → "when breastfeeding failed"
- No pseudosociological language, figurative language, AI-slop phrases, or anachronisms found
- Chronology flows correctly from birth to death
