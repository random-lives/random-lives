Review complete for **0174-qori**.

**Summary:** This is a well-crafted infant story (7 months old). The narrative properly:
- Introduces the family structure (father Temür, mother Esen, grandmother Ongon)
- Establishes the two living siblings Boro (age 5) and Saran (age 4) as helpers
- Appropriately mentions Togul (the firstborn who died in 982) through the grandmother's stories
- Describes the Khitan pastoralist context, steppe shamanic practices, and the household's client relationship to chief Nayan
- Shows the infant's death from respiratory infection with appropriate cultural response

No issues found. No changes made.
