Review complete for story 0142-devi.

**Summary of review for 0142-devi:**

**Issues found:**
1. **Chronology issue**: The paragraph starting "By 2022 Radha's health began to fail..." jumped backward to mention "In 2021 the family's money troubles worsened" after a paragraph about Nikhil's birth in 2022
2. **Minor figurative language**: "brought the house inward" was slightly metaphorical

**Changes made:**
1. Fixed chronology by changing "In 2021 the family's money troubles worsened" → "From the pregnancy onward, the family's money troubles worsened" - this maintains the temporal flow without jumping backward since the pregnancy was established in 2021
2. Changed "brought the house inward" → "kept everyone inside"

The story was overall well-written with good coverage of:
- Family structure (mother Radha, father absent, grandmother Kalyani's death in 2016, sister Sreelakshmi's birth)
- Mental health manifestations (bipolar-spectrum symptoms clearly shown)
- Trait visibility (low conscientiousness, low extraversion, high honesty-humility all visible)
- Children's births properly documented
- No pseudosociological "kin" language found
