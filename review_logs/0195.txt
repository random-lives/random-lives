The chronology is now correct. Let me verify the timeline one more time:

**Corrected Timeline:**
- Zhi born -493
- Wen born -471 (Zhi is 22) ✓
- Jia born -468 (Zhi is 25) ✓
- Biao born -466 (Zhi is 27) ✓ 
- Biao dies -465 (age ~1) → "did not survive her second winter" ✓
- Danu dies -463 (Zhi is 30) → "Two years later" ✓
- Kalu dies -461 (Zhi is 32) → immediately after Danu ✓
- Theft winter -461/-460 (Zhi is 32) ✓
- Jia dies -460 (Zhi is 33, Jia is 8) → "The following year" ✓

All deaths are accounted for and in correct order. The story is now chronologically accurate.

Let me do one final scan for any other issues I may have missed:

1. **"kin"** - Fixed (changed to "Hemu's household" and "Xiu's family")
2. **All caretaker deaths mentioned**: Mao (age 16), Qin (age 19), Hemu (age 42), Yan (age 47) - all ✓
3. **All sibling deaths mentioned**: Nuo (age 8, infant), Aru (age 46), Shao (age 53) - all ✓
4. **All child deaths mentioned**: Biao, Danu, Kalu, Jia - all ✓
5. **Rong survives** - correctly shown as still alive at end ✓
6. **Xiu** - not explicitly stated as surviving but implied (no death mentioned) - acceptable

The review is complete. Here's a summary:

---

**Review of 0195-zhi.md completed.**

**Issues found and fixed:**
1. **Qin's sister reference** - Changed to "an older aunt" since Qin died 3 years before Wen was born
2. **Sibling spacing** - Changed "Three years later" to "Two years later" for Biao's birth (matching debug data)
3. **Major chronological restructuring** - The original narrative placed Biao's death, Danu's death, and Kalu's death AFTER Jia's death, but they all occurred before Jia died. Restructured paragraphs to:
   - Biao's death (-465) → infant deaths (Danu -463, Kalu -461) → theft (-461/-460) → Jia's death (-460)
4. **Pseudosociological language** - Changed "Zhi's father's kin argued with Xiu's natal kin" to "Hemu's household argued with Xiu's family"

All deaths are now properly placed in chronological order and the family timeline is accurate.
