Review of **0101-rani** is complete.

**Summary:**
- **One minor issue found**: The word "diapers" was anachronistic for a hunter-gatherer context (6857 BC)
- **Fix applied**: Changed "Rani's diapers stayed wet" → "Rani's bowels ran watery" - this maintains the symptom (diarrhea/dehydration) without the modern terminology

**Overall assessment**: This is a well-crafted infant story. The family structure is clear (Tala died before Rani's birth, Mika born after her death), both parents survive through the narrative, the death is handled with appropriate detail, and the prose is plain and direct without figurative language or pseudosociological jargon.
