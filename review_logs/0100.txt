The story now reads well. All the key issues have been fixed:

1. **Younger siblings introduced**: Added a dedicated paragraph listing all the younger siblings born between 1947-1960
2. **Missing deaths added**: 
   - Ranjit Kaur (1965, age 5) - added in chronological position after the 1965 war
   - Kishan Kaur (2007) - added in the death paragraph
   - Chacha Mohinder Singh (2010) - added in the death paragraph
3. **Missing siblings integrated**:
   - Dalbir Kaur - added during debt crisis (passes news, sends help)
   - Satpal Singh - added in later life (helps with hospital trips)
4. **Figurative language removed**: "like smoke" simile replaced

The story now properly accounts for all 10 siblings (Harbans, Jarnail, Surinder, Harcharan, Gurmeet, Baljit, Dalbir, Avtar, Satpal, Manjit, Ranjit) and tracks their deaths correctly.
