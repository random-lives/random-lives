Review complete for **0125-person-0125-unnamed**.

**Summary:**
- **Issue found:** The stillborn infant was incorrectly named "Prokop" in the narrative, but the debug data clearly indicates `naming_category: unnamed` (died before naming ceremony) and `cause_of_death: Stillbirth`
- **Changes made:**
  1. Changed "Prokop was born on" → "The child was born on"
  2. Changed "the child was delivered, a boy, motionless. Zdislava rubbed him" → "the child was delivered, motionless. Zdislava rubbed the body" (removed redundant "a boy" since "His parents" already establishes sex, and changed "him" to "the body" for consistency)

The rest of the narrative was clean - no pseudosociological language, no figurative language, no other issues. The story is short (appropriate for a stillborn infant) and handles the subject matter with appropriate plainness.
