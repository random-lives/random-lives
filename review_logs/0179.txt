Review of 0179-bao.md is complete.

**Summary of Review:**

**Issues found:**
1. **[Pseudosociological]** "Her kin washed her body" - generic "kin" language
2. **[Missing death]** Maternal uncle Liu dies 1310 - not mentioned (appeared helping during crisis years)
3. **[Missing death]** Sister Mei dies 1337 (same year as Bao) - not mentioned

**Changes made:**
- Changed "Her kin washed her body" → "The women of the household washed her body"
- Added uncle Liu's death in chronological position (after crisis years, before He Chun's death)
- Added sister Mei's death before Bao's final illness paragraph

The story was otherwise well-constructed with good family timeline coverage, clear chronology, and no AI-slop or figurative language issues.
