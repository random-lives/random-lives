I've completed the review of story 0123-petrus.

**Summary:**

The story is well-constructed overall. It properly accounts for:
- All siblings (including 3 infant deaths during Petrus's lifetime)
- Mother's death (1328)
- Grandmother Liisa's death (1322)
- The partner relationship with Annike
- Extreme traits: low physical attractiveness (4th percentile) shown through mockery of his looks; low Honesty-Humility (7th percentile) shown through petty theft after being robbed; short height (6th percentile) mentioned explicitly

**Issues found and fixed:**
1. **Figurative language**: "watched the grain bin like a living thing that could vanish" → "checked the grain bin each morning"
2. **Awkward phrasing**: "Henricus's wife's brother, Jaan" → "his mother's brother, Jaan"
