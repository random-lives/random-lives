**Review complete for 0127-omi.**

**Summary:** This is a well-crafted infant narrative (age 1) set in Late Chalcolithic central Anatolia (~3555-3553 BC). The story has:

- **Clear family structure**: All caretakers properly introduced (mother Luma, father Tari, paternal grandmother Haru, paternal grandfather Danu)
- **No siblings**: Correctly reflects debug data showing 0 siblings
- **No missing deaths**: All caretakers have null death_year in debug data (outlived the infant)
- **No pseudosociological language**: The phrase "elders and kin" in line 110 is acceptable as it describes political structure, not family relationships in narrative action
- **Good concrete details**: Juniper smoke, flour/beer offerings, donkey loads of yarn and hides
- **Appropriate length**: ~240 words, within the 150-300 word guideline for infants

No edits needed. The story is clean and ready for publication.
