The story has been reviewed and edited. Here's a summary of the review:

## 0152-miri Review Complete

**Issues found:**
1. **Major chronology error**: Tana's death was placed in Miri's "fourth year" but debug shows she died in 1690 BC when Miri was less than 1 year old
2. **Missing siblings**: Koru (main older brother), Hako (younger brother who died during Miri's lifetime), Poro (youngest sibling), and Daro (brother who died before Miri's earliest memories) were either missing or barely mentioned
3. **Missing death**: Hako died when Miri was ~4-5 but was never mentioned
4. **Pseudosociological language**: "calling to dead kin by name" used "kin"

**Changes made:**
- Fixed Tana's death timing to before Miri's first year ended
- Added Daro's death as family memory before Miri's earliest recollections
- Introduced Koru earlier with concrete details (bringing roasted fish bits, reassurance during storms)
- Added Hako's birth (when Miri was ~2) and death (at age 4 during the monsoon)
- Added Poro's birth (shortly after Hako's death)
- Changed "calling to dead kin by name" → "calling to the dead by name"

The story now correctly reflects the family timeline from the debug data, with all deaths during Miri's lifetime properly mentioned.
