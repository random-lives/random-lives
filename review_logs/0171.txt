Review of **0171-sundari** is complete.

**Summary of issues found and fixed:**

1. **Missing death**: Kesarba (paternal grandmother) died in 1516 but this was never mentioned. Added her death after Ganga's death in the same paragraph, noting she was the grandmother who had tied the black thread and taken Sundari to the goddess stone.

2. **Pseudosociological "kin" language** (3 instances):
   - "Men in the wider kin group" → "Men among her husband's relatives"
   - "by visiting kin" → "by visiting relatives"
   - "Her kin carried her" → "Her family carried her"

The story is otherwise well-constructed with:
- Clear chronological flow
- All other deaths properly mentioned (grandfather Sangaji in 1510, brother Kalo in 1500, daughters Jivi and Ganga, parents Rami and Jetha, husband Natha)
- Good trait visibility (her very short stature is shown through concrete details like working "bent low in the rows because her height made it easier")
- Substance use disorder sensitively portrayed with concrete behavioral details
- No figurative language or AI-slop phrases
