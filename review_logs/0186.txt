## Review Summary: 0186-person-0186-unnamed

**Story overview:** An unnamed infant boy born February 21, 1432 in the Otomí highlands of Mexico who died on the same day due to a congenital anomaly. A brief but well-written narrative covering the birth, death, and burial.

**Issues found:**
- Parent names used IPA symbols (ɔ, ɨ) which violate the naming policy for inferable/reconstructed names

**Changes made:**
- "Tɔhɨ" → "Tohi"
- "Ñuxa" → "Nuxa"

**No other issues:** The story is otherwise clean - no missing deaths, no pseudosociological language, no figurative language or AI-slop, no vague hedging, chronology is correct, and the unnamed infant is appropriately not given a name in the narrative (correctly following the `naming_category: unnamed` designation).
