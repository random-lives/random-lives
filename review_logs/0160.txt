Review of **0160-ismail** is complete.

**Summary:**

This is a short, well-written infant death story (7 days old) set in 13th century Shirvan under Mongol rule.

**Issues found:**
1. Missing context about Yahya, an older brother who died in 1266 before Ismail's birth - this would have shaped the family's anxiety about male infants
2. Amina's age (7) was not specified while Fatima's age (10) was

**Changes made:**
- Added: "Khadija had already lost a son, Yahya, who died in 1266 at one year old. That loss made her watchful."
- Changed "her sister Amina" → "her younger sister Amina, seven"

The story passed all other checks:
- No deaths to track during Ismail's 7-day lifetime (all caretakers and siblings still alive)
- No "kin" language
- No vague hedging or figurative language
- No AI-slop phrases
- Chronology is clear and correct
- Family structure properly introduced
