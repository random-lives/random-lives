The story is now complete. Let me do one final check for any remaining issues:

1. **AI-slop/figurative language**: The original "Loss tightened around her" was removed when I rewrote that section.

2. **Chronology**: Now correctly ordered (age 27, late twenties/30, 32, 35, 40, 42, 45, 47, 55, 60, 62, 71)

3. **All deaths covered**: Confirmed above

4. **No "kin" in narrative**: Confirmed earlier

5. **No vague hedging**: Confirmed earlier

The review is complete. The story for 0176-xiu.md has been reviewed and corrected. Here's a summary:

## Review Summary: 0176-xiu

**Issues found:**
- Three critical missing deaths: father Wei (age 27), mother Mei (age 45), eldest daughter Mei (age 62)
- Chronology error: three deaths compressed into "early forties" but actually spanned ages 40-47
- Figurative language: "Loss tightened around her"

**Changes made:**
- Added father Wei's death at age 27
- Added mother Mei's death at age 45 (same season as daughter Lan's death)
- Added eldest daughter Mei's death at age 62
- Fixed chronology: separated the deaths into correct ages (40, 42, 45, 47)
- Reordered the fall accident (age 42) to occur before the later deaths
- Removed the figurative "Loss tightened around her" phrase
- Minor cleanup of redundant "daughter Mei" reference
