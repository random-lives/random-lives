The review of story 0114-ravi is complete.

**Summary of review for 0114-ravi:**

**Issues found:**
- [Pseudosociological] "kin ties" 
- [Pseudosociological] "kin networks"
- [Missing context] Lakshmi described as "now married" but her marriage (and sisters' marriages) never established
- [Temporal] "In late 2025" needs updating to January 2026

**Changes made:**
- Changed "kin ties" → "family ties"
- Changed "through kin networks" → "through family connections"
- Added sentence establishing when the three sisters got married: "Rani married first, then Sujatha, who moved to a village a few hours away. Lakshmi married later, after Ravi's own wedding."
- Changed "In late 2025" → "In early 2026"

The story is otherwise well-constructed with good coverage of family deaths (grandmother Poshamma and infant sister Anitha both mentioned), clear chronology, and no figurative language issues.
