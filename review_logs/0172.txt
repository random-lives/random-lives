Review of story 0172-karna is complete.

**Summary of issues found and fixed:**

1. **[CRITICAL - Missing death]** Mother Sita dies in 842 according to debug data, but the narrative had her alive in 843 caring for dying Karna. Fixed by:
   - Adding her death in 842: "That same year Sita died. She had grown thin and slow through the debt years, and a fever took her before the harvest."
   - Removing her from the final scene (changed "Padma and Sita gave him thin rice water" → "Padma gave him thin rice water")

2. **[Vague hedging]** "a lump of jaggery or roasted gram" → "jaggery" (LLM indecision resolved)

3. **[Pseudosociological language]** "before she could be properly named by the wider kin" → "within a week" (removed awkward "wider kin" phrasing)

4. **[Chronology]** Fixed temporal backtrack where paragraph started "In 836 and 837 the rains had already turned uncertain" after the previous paragraph had covered events through 840. Reorganized so the drought context comes at the start of the children paragraph.
