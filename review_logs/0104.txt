**Review complete for 0104-nikhil.**

**Summary:** This is a well-written story with strong structure and flow. The only issue found was a minor temporal inconsistency - the final paragraph said "By late 2025" but the person is alive and we're now in January 2026. Changed to "Now, in early 2026" to bring the narrative to the current moment.

**What was checked:**
- Family structure: All family members accounted for (parents Suresh and Meena, brother Jayesh, wife Pooja - all alive)
- Death coverage: N/A - no deaths to cover (everyone is still living)
- Sibling introduction: Jayesh properly introduced in paragraph 2 with birth year
- Partner introduction: Pooja properly introduced in 2022
- Chronology: Events flow correctly from 1998 birth through present
- Historical events: Gujarat earthquake (2001), communal violence (2002), demonetization (2016), COVID (2020) all appropriately placed
- Pseudosociological language: No "kin" found
- AI-slop phrases: None found
- Figurative language: Minimal and appropriate
- Vague hedging: None found
