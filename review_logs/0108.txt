Review complete for **0108-sina**.

**Summary:**
- **Issues found:** 1 - Raku's age was incorrectly listed as 14 when he would have been 12 at Sina's birth
- **Changes made:** Fixed "Raku, fourteen" → "Raku, twelve"

The story is otherwise well-structured:
- All living siblings at Sina's birth are properly introduced (Mira, Nali, Taki, Kuna, Raku)
- The two infant deaths before Sina (Aka and Luma) are correctly mentioned
- No pseudosociological "kin" language
- No figurative language or AI-slop phrases
- No vague hedging
- Chronology is clear and correct
- Death scene is concrete and well-handled
