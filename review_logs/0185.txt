Review complete for **0185-aleksey.md**.

**Summary:**
This was a well-written story with good coverage of all deaths and family structure. The story is about a Russian peasant man (1897-1945) with intellectual disability living through the tumultuous events of 20th century Russia - WWI, Revolution, collectivization, WWII occupation of Bryansk.

**Issues found and fixed:**
1. **Pseudosociological language**: "borrow from kin" → "borrow from Ivan and Anna" (specifying the actual relatives mentioned in debug data)
2. **Vague hedging**: "grain or fodder" → "grain" (LLM indecision)
3. **Figurative language**: "the household tightened around him" → "the household shrank to him" (clearer and more literal)
4. **Clarity**: "The village set it as best they could" → "The village set the bone as best they could" (clarified what "it" referred to)

**No issues found with:**
- Death coverage (all 8 deaths during protagonist's lifetime mentioned: grandfather Maksim 1908, brother Stepan 1914, grandmother Ulyana 1916, father Fyodor 1932, daughter Tatyana 1929, mother Praskovya 1939, wife Ekaterina 1941)
- Younger sibling births (Vasiliy's 1899 birth and death mentioned)
- Family introductions (all siblings and grandparents properly introduced early)
- Chronology (events flow correctly)
- Trait visibility (intellectual disability and low conscientiousness well-shown throughout)
