Review complete for **0189-sena**.

**Summary:**

**Issues found:**
- [Clarity] The narrative incorrectly stated "Four older sisters were alive in the yard" but then named only three living sisters (Suma, Mira, Rani) plus "the memory of" Dasi, who had died before Sena's birth. This was confusing—a memory is not someone alive.

**Changes made:**
- Rewrote the sentence to correctly state "Three older sisters were alive" and clearly separate Dasi as a fourth who "had died in infancy years earlier." Also added the sisters' ages at Sena's birth for clarity (Suma 10, Mira 6, Rani 2).

**Other checks performed:**
- Death coverage: Lali (baby sister, died 329) is mentioned ✓
- No caretaker deaths during Sena's lifetime
- No "kin" pseudosociological language
- No vague hedging ("or" constructions)
- No figurative language or AI-slop phrases
- Chronology is sound
- Named character (Sena) is appropriate—naming category is "inferable", not "unnamed"
