I've completed the review of **0115-kaushalya.md**.

**Summary**: This is a well-written short story about a 3-year-old girl who died from diarrheal disease in 1966 Punjab. The story is clean overall with only one minor grammatical issue found.

**Issues found and fixed:**
- One awkward phrase: "Kaushalya stayed close during visitors" → "Kaushalya stayed close when visitors came"

**Checklist verified:**
- ✓ No missing deaths (all family members survive past her death)
- ✓ Younger brother Rakesh's birth is mentioned
- ✓ No "kin" language
- ✓ No vague hedging (" or ")
- ✓ No figurative language or AI-slop
- ✓ Personality traits visible (high openness through curiosity, low extraversion through staying close to mother, conscientiousness through putting things back)
- ✓ Chronology correct
- ✓ Death scene appropriately detailed for a toddler story
