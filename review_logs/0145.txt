"sounded like argument" - this is fine, not figurative language but a description of how his questions were perceived.

The review is complete. Let me provide a summary:

## Review Complete: 0145-arthur-bernard-keegan

**Issues found and fixed:**

1. **Birth order error** - Changed "fifth of six children" to "third of six children" (deviated from debug data which incorrectly had birth_order_position: 5, but sibling birth years clearly show Arthur as 3rd born)

2. **Missing sibling deaths** - Added three deaths that occurred during Arthur's lifetime:
   - Mary (1992) - added paragraph describing her role as family connector
   - Sister Eileen (1997) - added in final paragraph
   - Seán (2000) - added in final paragraph, noted he died earlier same year as Arthur

3. **Chronology error** - Moved the pub fight paragraph (1948 event) from after 1956 events to its correct position after the 1948/1950 children births

4. **Name clarity** - Distinguished between daughter Eileen and sister Eileen by adding "his daughter" and "His sister" qualifiers
