Review of 0140-sīlā is complete. Here's a summary of what I found and fixed:

## Review Summary: 0140-sīlā

**Issues found:**
1. **Missing death - Father Dharaka** (died -40, Sīlā age ~19) - not mentioned
2. **Missing death - Mother Kālī** (died -22, Sīlā age ~37) - not mentioned
3. **Minor chronology** - Nanda's birth described as "A year later" but debug shows 2-year gap
4. **Pseudosociological "kin" language** - three instances: "kin nearby", "kin household", "affinal kin"
5. **Minor figurative language** - "Pain locked her hip"

**Changes made:**
- Added Dharaka's death after Sīlā's marriage: "Dharaka died the next year, worn by labor and fever."
- Added Kālī's death in the midlife section: "Her mother Kālī had died some years earlier, after seasons of recurring fever."
- Fixed chronology: "A year later" → "Two years later"
- Fixed all "kin" usages: "kin nearby" → "family nearby", "kin household" → "her late husband's family", "affinal kin" → "husband's relatives"
- Fixed figurative: "Pain locked" → "Pain seized"

The story is otherwise well-constructed with good family structure, clear chronology, and appropriate detail for a 68-year life.
