Review of story 0135-tarabai is complete.

**Summary:**

The story is well-written overall with excellent trait visibility (very low agreeableness, very low extraversion, very high intelligence, and very short stature are all vividly portrayed throughout the narrative). The family structure is clear, all deaths during the protagonist's lifetime are properly mentioned (father Bhimaji in 1702), and there are no pseudosociological "kin" usages or figurative language issues.

**One issue found and fixed:**
- **Minor chronology**: The severe fever (age 18) appeared before the bazaar cheating incident (age 17). Reordered the paragraphs and changed "That year" to "The following year" to correctly show: cheating at 17 → fever at 18.
