Review of **0181-sifrid** is complete.

**Summary:**
- This is a well-written infant death narrative (born and died September 4, 1361)
- Only one minor issue found: "shaped his family's days" was slightly figurative
- Changed to "governed his family's days" for more direct language
- No missing deaths to report (all family deaths occurred after Sifrid's death on his birth day)
- No pseudosociological language, no hedging, no chronology issues
- The emergency lay baptism by the grandmother is historically accurate for 14th century Catholic practice
