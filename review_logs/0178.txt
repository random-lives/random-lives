Review complete for **0178-nara.md**.

**Summary:**
- **Issue found:** The phrasing "Nara's older sister Mina had already died" was misleading - it suggested Mina died before Nara was born, but according to the debug data, Mina died in 696 BC when Nara was about 2 years old.
- **Change made:** Clarified to "Nara's older sister Mina had died the year before, at three" - this specifies both the timing (the year before the narrative's main events, when Nara was ~2) and Mina's age at death (3).

The rest of the story is well-constructed:
- Family structure clearly explained (polygynous household with two partners)
- All caretakers properly introduced
- Younger brother Salu's birth mentioned appropriately
- Personality traits visible through behavior (startles at noises, clingy, brings cup for baby brother)
- No figurative language or AI-slop phrases
- Clean chronology
