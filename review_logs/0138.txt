**Review complete for 0138-person-0138-unnamed.**

**Summary**: This is a clean story. It's a short infant story about a stillbirth in 1746 Unnao, India. The narrative:
- Correctly leaves the child unnamed (matching `naming_category: unnamed`)
- Mentions the previous sibling who died as an infant in 1745
- Uses plain, direct prose with no figurative language or AI-slop
- Has clear chronology flowing from context → previous loss → pregnancy precautions → delivery → burial
- Contains no pseudosociological "kin" language

No changes were needed.
