The review of **0144-yin-niang** is complete.

**Summary**: This is a clean story with no issues found. It's a well-crafted infant narrative about a premature baby girl who lived only hours on November 26, 1263, in Guangdong under Southern Song rule.

The story correctly:
- Introduces all six living siblings at birth with appropriate ages/roles
- Mentions the earlier infant death (Wu-ge) as family context
- Uses plain, direct prose without figurative language
- Maintains appropriate length (~200 words) for a same-day death
- Uses historically accurate details (Southern Song dynasty ended 1279)
- Avoids pseudosociological language (no "kin" usage)

No edits were needed.
