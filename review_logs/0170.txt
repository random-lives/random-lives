The review for story 0170-thushari is complete.

**Summary of 0170-thushari review:**

**Issues found:**
1. **Data error**: Frontmatter had `lifestyle: "FLAG: Urban"` but debug data shows "Rural" - the character lives in a rural Sri Lankan village
2. **Clarity issue**: The orphaned child description was unclear about whose child it was

**Changes made:**
1. Fixed lifestyle from "FLAG: Urban" to "Rural"
2. Clarified the orphan situation: changed "leaving a young child without a stable home. Thushari brought the child into her parents' house and registered them at the local school" to "leaving a young child orphaned. Thushari brought the orphan into her parents' house and registered the child at the local school"

**Story quality assessment:** This is a well-written, contemporary story with good trait visibility (very low neuroticism shown through calm responses to violence and crises, high agreeableness shown through conflict mediation, low conscientiousness shown through forgotten paperwork). All family members are alive per debug data, so no missing deaths to add. The chronology flows smoothly. No "kin" language or vague hedging found.
