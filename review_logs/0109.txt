Review of **0109-ami** is complete.

**Summary:**
- This is a short infant story (age 0, lived ~19 days) set in Neolithic China (5368 BC)
- One issue found: pseudosociological "kin ties" → changed to "family ties"
- Death coverage: No deaths needed to be added (no family members died during Ami's 19-day life)
- The narrative correctly introduces the family (older brother Koru as a toddler, parents Oru and Nara, elder Sana, midwife Pali)
- Younger siblings (Lumi, Tenu) are correctly not mentioned since they were born after Ami died
- The cause of death (umbilical infection) is well-portrayed
- No figurative language, AI-slop, or vague hedging found
