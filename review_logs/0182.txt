## Review Summary for 0182-joga

**Issues found:**
1. **Missing death** - Grandmother Dukhi dies 1920 (Joga age 19) - she was mentioned during the influenza years (1918) but her death was never stated
2. **Missing sibling birth/death** - Sister Lita born 1903, dies 1903 - a sibling who died during Joga's childhood was not mentioned at all  
3. **Pseudosociological language** - "lived close to his kin" 
4. **Pseudosociological language** - "hosting kin"

**Changes made:**
1. Added Dukhi's death: "Dukhi died that same year, after a short illness that left her unable to rise from her mat. Joga helped carry her to the burial ground. The compound felt emptier without her."
2. Added Lita's birth and death alongside Jatra's introduction: "In 1903 a sister, Lita, was born and died before the monsoon ended. The next year a brother, Jatra, arrived and survived."
3. Changed "lived close to his kin" → "lived near his brothers' households"
4. Changed "hosting kin" → "hosting relatives"
