The review is complete.

**Summary of review for 0180-zi:**

**Issue found:**
- Chronology error: The narrative mentioned Mo (younger sister) being born "soon after" Zi's death. However, the debug data shows Mo was born in 1431 BC while Zi died in September 1432 BC—Mo was born after Zi died and should not appear in Zi's narrative at all.

**Change made:**
- Removed the sentence "Soon after, Mu delivered another daughter, Mo, who died at birth."

The rest of the story is clean: family structure is clear, the older sister Nü who died before Zi's birth is properly contextualized, all living family members (father Geng, mother Mu, grandmother Ding, grandfather Ren, uncle Xin) are introduced appropriately, and the narrative flows well for a short infant life.
