I've completed the review of story 0107-guang.

**Review Summary for 0107-guang:**

This is a clean infant story about a baby boy in 4th century rural Guangdong, China. The story is well-structured:

- **Family structure**: Correct - Guang was the firstborn child, so no older siblings to introduce. Parents Zhao and Wei are properly established.
- **Death coverage**: No deaths to mention during Guang's lifetime (parents both alive at his death, no older siblings)
- **Chronology**: Events flow correctly from birth through daily life, illness, death, and burial
- **Language**: No pseudosociological "kin" language, no vague hedging, no figurative language, no AI-slop phrases

**Issues found:** None  
**Changes made:** None
