**Summary of review for 0167-iorwase.md:**

**Issues found:**
1. Missing character: Gbaahemba (paternal uncle who taught dispute resolution) never introduced or mentioned
2. Missing death: Iortyom (youngest brother) dies 1902 but death never mentioned
3. Missing sibling: Orkpe (younger sister, survives protagonist) completely missing
4. Chronology error: Yam theft (1873-1874) placed after 1879 events
5. Pseudosociological language: "network of kin", "kin support", "compensation between kin"

**Changes made:**
- Added Orkpe, Shagher, and Iortyom to sibling paragraph with birth years

- Added Gbaahemba's death (1892) after the arbitration scene
- Added Iortyom's death (1902) in colonial section
- Moved yam theft paragraph to correct chronological position (after 1872 children, before 1878)
- Changed "network of kin" → "network of family"
- Changed "kin support" → "family support"
- Changed "compensation between kin" → "compensation between families"
