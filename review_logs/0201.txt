Review of **0201-nasreen** is complete.

**Summary of changes made:**
1. Added mother Bibi Gul's death in 2016 (was missing)
2. Changed "Bruises bloomed" → "Bruises darkened" (figurative language fix)
3. Added "short and plain-faced" to describe her appearance (trait visibility)
4. Added "She watched the other women carefully, noted who had the mother-in-law's ear, and made herself useful to the ones who mattered" (low honesty-humility trait visibility)
