Review complete for **0166-pārvatī.md**.

**Summary:**
- **Issues found:** 1 issue - Height at 8th percentile (extremely short) was not mentioned in the narrative
- **Changes made:** Added height visibility in the marriage paragraph: "She was short, her head barely reaching Rājā's shoulder."

The story is otherwise well-constructed:
- All deaths during Pārvatī's lifetime are accounted for (grandfather Gautama in 640, grandmother Sumitrā in 641)
- Family structure is clear with siblings introduced properly
- Younger sister Jayā's birth is mentioned
- No pseudosociological "kin" language
- No vague hedging or figurative language
- All extreme personality traits are visible in the narrative (low intelligence, high extraversion, low agreeableness, high neuroticism, high conscientiousness, high openness)
- Chronology is correct throughout
