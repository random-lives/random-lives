**Review complete for 0188-durgādeva**

**Summary:** This is a well-crafted infant story about a baby who lived only 3 days (February 8-11, 1133) in 12th century Bengal. 

**Issues found:** None

The story is:
- Historically accurate (Sena dynasty ruled Bengal in 1133 under Vijaya Sena)
- Clear in family structure (stem household with parents, grandmother Nandinī, and older brother Gopāla)
- Appropriately brief for a 3-day lifespan
- Free of AI-slop, figurative language, and vague hedging
- Correct in its religious/cultural details (Hindu protective rites, vermilion, clay figures)
