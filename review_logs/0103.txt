Review of **0103-nabira** is complete. Here's a summary:

**Issues found and fixed:**
1. **Missing character**: Muboni (maternal aunt) was completely absent despite being a significant caretaker. Added her introduction after Nakato's death (1758) and her own death (1776).
2. **Pseudosociological language**: Fixed 4 instances of "kin"/"affines" → "family"/"relatives"/"in-laws"
3. **Chronology error**: The illness paragraph mentioned "By 1769" but appeared after describing events from 1770-1772. Rewrote to flow naturally: "The bouts of fever and heavy fatigue that had begun in Kasolo's final years continued through the 1770s"
4. **Figurative language**: Changed personification "The land itself was treated as a force with temper and appetite" → "The land itself was held to be powerful and demanding"

The story is otherwise well-structured with good family introductions, clear chronology of siblings (including the two infant deaths before Nabira's birth), and all other deaths properly covered (Nakato 1758, Lukasa 1762, Kasolo 1768, infant Kamaso 1758).
