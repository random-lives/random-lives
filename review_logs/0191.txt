## Review Complete: 0191-kima

**Summary:** This is a well-crafted story about Kima, a Central Andean highland hunter-gatherer woman who lived from 8721 BC to 8647 BC (74 years).

**Issues found:** Only one minor issue:
- [Pseudosociological] "Mara's kin stepped in" - changed to "Mara and her brothers stepped in"

**What the story does well:**
- All family deaths are properly covered (Tanu, Piru, Saku, Mara, Lami, Yako)
- Younger sibling Piru's birth is mentioned appropriately
- Chronology flows smoothly from childhood through old age
- Personality traits (low agreeableness, high conscientiousness) manifest naturally through actions
- PTSD symptoms from childhood abuse, raid exposure, and domestic violence are woven throughout
- No figurative language or AI-slop phrases
- Clear family structure and character introductions
- The narrative captures the texture of high-altitude forager life without romanticizing it
