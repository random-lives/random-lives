#     incident: chronic_illness
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6
#     key_events:
#     - Born 128 into an extended patrilocal household near Batvači/Vodnjan countryside;
#       father hired fieldhand, mother does food processing for sale.
#     - Learns household cult routines (hearth offerings; small vows at local shrine)
#       and early work-help (water, kindling, tending younger siblings).
#     - Infant sister dies (132) and household intensifies protective practices (amulets,
#       careful avoidance of ill-omen days).
#     phase: 'Early childhood (birth household: patrilocal, landless)'
#   - age_range: 7-15
#     key_events:
#     - Youngest brother dies (139); Julia takes on more childcare/housework early.
#     - Begins regular seasonal fieldwork alongside women (weeding, gleaning, harvest
#       support) and learns bargaining/credit realities despite illiteracy.
#     - At puberty becomes more withdrawn/quiet than peers (very low extraversion),
#       preferring known kin groups and predictable routines.
#     phase: Later childhood and adolescence (work socialization)
#   - age_range: 16-33
#     key_events:
#     - Marries Marcus in 144 and moves locally to his kin cluster; continues as seasonal
#       fieldhand while managing household.
#     - Nine births begin; several infant deaths occur (145, 147; later 155; 161), shaping
#       ongoing anxiety and periods of sadness.
#     - Builds reputation as reliable worker; maintains cooperative ties through extreme
#       agreeableness (mediating disputes, sharing food when possible).
#     phase: 'Young adulthood: first marriage, high fertility, early losses'
#   - age_range: 34-50
#     key_events:
#     - First husband dies (161); debt/rent arrears force loss of rented patch and harsher
#       labor arrangements (grain advances).
#     - Remarries Gaius (164) for protection and economic survival; household remains
#       marginal but more stable than during immediate widowhood.
#     - Antonine Plague era (c. 165-178) brings fear, periodic labor shortages, and
#       recurring illness in the community; her sister dies (164) adding grief.
#     phase: 'Midlife: widowhood crisis, remarriage, plague years, caregiving'
#   - age_range: 51-64
#     key_events:
#     - Recognized as organizer for harvest gangs (roughly 169-176), securing steadier
#       hiring for her kin group despite low status.
#     - Develops chronic winter cough/weakness beginning about 178, limiting heavy carrying;
#       continues lighter tasks and supervision when possible.
#     - Lives in a complex household with second husband and an adult child’s family;
#       dies 192 from an unrecognized malignancy after decline.
#     phase: 'Later adulthood and old age: leadership at work, chronic illness, multi-generation

#       and burden of mourning/caretaking for the household.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Earns trust that later makes her the preferred organizer for a harvest
#       gang; also leads to being overburdened because others assume she will comply.
#     scene: During harvest-day disputes over rations and turns at the water jar, Julia
#       de-escalates arguments, offers to take the worst row herself, and negotiates
#       a compromise with the overseer without open defiance.
#     timing: young adulthood through later adulthood (especially ages 20-48)
#     trait: Agreeableness (very high)
#   - consequence: Strengthens reputation for fairness and keeps continued hiring; occasionally
#       leaves her household worse off than families willing to cheat.
#     scene: When distributing grain advances to the work gang, she refuses to skim
#       extra for her own household and publicly accounts for measures by sight and
#       shared tally marks, even when her children are hungry.
#     timing: midlife (ages 41-48)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (very high)
#   - consequence: Limits access to broader patronage networks and information; protects
#       her from some conflicts but increases isolation during grief.
#     scene: At festivals and market days she stays at the edge, speaks little, and
#       avoids singing/dancing; she prefers small, familiar work groups and communicates
#       in brief, practical phrases.
#     timing: adolescence onward (ages 12+)
#     trait: Extraversion (very low)
#   - consequence: Contributes to somatic complaints and fatigue; motivates meticulous
#       preventive routines (cleanliness, offerings, avoiding risky travel).
#     scene: After infant deaths she becomes watchful and easily startled, checks on
#       sleeping babies repeatedly, interprets minor symptoms as ominous, and experiences
#       sleepless nights before harvest hiring days.
#     timing: young adulthood to midlife (ages 17-40) with later recurrences
#     trait: Neuroticism (high)
#   - consequence: Reduced earning capacity at critical times; increased dependence
#       on kin; pushes her toward quieter roles (sorting olives, supervising children)
#       rather than constant heavy labor.
#     scene: Following widowhood and the loss of a child, she withdraws, eats little,
#       moves slowly, and speaks of feeling 'heavy' and useless; later episodes recur
#       after adult children die, with weeks of low mood and inability to work full
#       days.
#     timing: major episode ages 33-36; recurrent episodes ages 52-63
#     trait: Depressive disorder (episodic/chronic)
# number_of_children: '9'
# number_of_siblings: '4'
# occupation: Seasonal agricultural wage laborer (fieldhand) as primary identity, alongside
#   domestic work
# religion: 'Household Roman cult (hearth and domestic spirits: offerings/prayers to
#   Lares/Penates, Vesta; family rites) plus occasional local shrine/temple visits and

# structured_incidents:
# - event: After her first husband died, arrears on rent and food debts to a nearby
#     villa’s steward forced her household to give up their small rented patch and take
#     on harsher seasonal labor in exchange for grain advances.
#   reasoning: She remained marginal/landless poor throughout life, and widowhood plus
#     many children creates high odds of periods of acute shortage, debt, or near-destitution
#     even if she avoided total collapse.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 33–36
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: She became known locally for reliable olive- and grain-harvest work and was
#     repeatedly chosen to organize a small gang of women and older children for a landholder’s
#     harvest days, securing steadier hiring for her kin group.
#   reasoning: As an illiterate, landless rural woman, formal recognition is unlikely;
#     her main 'achievements' would be ordinary survival and family maintenance, which
#     rarely registers as notable success.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 41–48
#   type: major_achievement
# - event: She developed a long-lasting cough with bouts of fever and weakness that
#     returned each winter, limiting how much she could carry and how long she could
#     work in the fields.
#   reasoning: Long-term conditions (chronic respiratory disease from smoke, recurrent
#     fevers, joint/back problems, untreated infections) were very common with lifelong
#     hard labor and poverty, especially into middle age.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 50–63
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: She spent months tending an adult son after a severe leg wound and infection
#     from field work, cleaning the wound, changing wrappings, and feeding him while
#     he could not walk or earn.
#   reasoning: In a multi-generation, poor household without institutional care, extended
#     tending of a spouse, child, or in-law through serious illness is very likely over
#     a long life.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 44–45

Julia was born on 15 November 128 in the countryside inland from the Istrian coast, in the Roman province that administrators called Histria. The empire’s law and taxes reached her village through stewards and magistrates, and Latin was the language people used for work bargains and prayers at shrines.

She entered an extended household under her father’s kin. Her father, Publius, went out before sunrise to find day work in other men’s fields, taking pruning jobs in winter and harvest work in summer. Her mother, Marcia, kept a small fire going and turned grain and milk into things that could be traded: flat loaves, curds, a jar of brined olives when the season allowed. Julia learned early to carry water, to watch the pot so it did not burn, and to keep quiet when strangers came to bargain.

In 132, when Julia was four, her mother gave birth to another girl who lived only hours. The women washed the body, wrapped it, and set a little lamp by the hearth. That night, Marcia made offerings at the household niche and spoke the names of the spirits who guarded thresholds and storerooms. Julia copied the gestures without understanding the words. She grew into a child who watched closely and spoke little.

Her younger sister Tullia was born in 130 and followed Julia everywhere. They walked the same paths to collect kindling and to glean fallen ears of grain behind the reapers. Julia did not push to the front of groups. She stayed at the edge, listening. When other girls bickered over a dropped fig or a ribbon of cloth, Julia ended it by giving up her share and turning back to the task.

Two brothers arrived after that. Decimus was born in 134 and lived, a thin boy with quick hands. The youngest, Quintus, was born in 136. In 139, Quintus died after a short illness. Julia was eleven and had already taken on the work of rocking babies and sweeping the packed earth floor. After Quintus died, she started checking the sleeping children again and again, pressing the back of her hand to their cheeks as if heat could be measured that way.

As she entered adolescence, she joined women in the fields for longer days. They weeded between vines, gathered stones from the rows, tied up shoots, and hauled sheaves when harvest came. Julia learned which estate overseers paid in grain and which tried to delay. She learned to keep her eyes down and her count of measures steady. Publius and Marcia could not read. Julia could not either, so she relied on memory and on witnesses, repeating aloud what had been promised so others would hear it too.

In 144, at sixteen, Julia married Marcus, a fieldhand from a settlement a short walk away. She moved into his kin’s household and took on a new hearth. On the first morning there, she made the small offering of salt and meal before she touched the day’s bread. She did not chatter with her new in-laws. She learned their routines and made herself useful.

A son was born in 145 and died the same day. Another son was born in 147 and died within days. Julia stopped sleeping in long stretches. She lay awake listening for breathing. When she did sleep, she woke sharply, convinced she had missed a sound. Marcus did not strike her in public, but inside the house he used his hands when anger took him, and she did not fight back. She cleaned herself, set the pot back on the coals, and returned to the field when the sun rose.

Children who lived followed. In 149 she gave birth to Lucius. In 151, a son, Sextus. In 153, a daughter, Tertia. In 155 another son was born and died. In 157, a daughter, Aurelia, arrived and lived. In 159, a son, Felix. In 161, another son was born and died.

Marcus kept chasing work, and Julia went with the other women to vineyards and grainfields. She brought Aurelia strapped to her back and set Lucius and Sextus at the field edge with a crust and a skin of water. She did not sing. She listened to others’ songs and watched the line of sickles. When someone fell behind, she stepped into the gap without being asked.

In 161 Marcus died after a fever that took him within days. That year had already been thin. Rains came hard at the wrong time and ruined part of the grain. Julia owed rent on the little patch they had been allowed to work and owed food debts to the steward of a nearby villa who had advanced grain through the winter. The steward came with two men and spoke plainly. The arrears stood. Julia’s household surrendered the rented patch and agreed to harsher seasonal labor in exchange for grain advances. The children ate the advance as soon as it arrived. Julia stopped talking even in the evenings. She sat by the hearth and stared into the ash until someone needed her hands.

In 164 she remarried. Gaius, a laborer tied to estate work, took her into his household and accepted her surviving children. That same year Tullia, her sister, died at thirty-four after a sickness that left her coughing blood. Julia helped wash her body. After the burial, Julia did not attend the next festival. She stayed home, swept the yard until her arms shook, and then lay down without speaking for a full day.

In 165, news of a plague moved along the roads and ports. People in nearby towns fell ill in clusters. In the countryside, the sickness arrived unevenly, then returned. Some employers offered higher pay for harvest days because too many hands were missing. Others tightened their grip, handing out grain advances that bound families to the next season’s work. Julia kept her children close. She boiled water longer than before. She avoided crowds and spoke through her husband when bargaining could be done that way.

In 169, after another hard year, a landholder’s overseer chose Julia to gather a work gang for the olive harvest. She did it quietly. She went house to house with Aurelia and made the invitation to women who needed the extra grain. She wrote nothing; she remembered names, ages, and who could climb ladders. On the harvest day she placed people where they could work, made sure the smallest children stayed in shade, and kept the measures fair. When the overseer tried to short the group, she did not shout. She pointed to the baskets and repeated the count until he adjusted it. The next year he asked for her again, and then again. With that role came steadier hiring for her kin group, and fewer empty days.

In 173, Lucius, now a grown man, tore his leg on a tool and the wound turned foul. Julia took him into the house, washed the cut with warm water and wine dregs, packed it with clean cloth, and changed the wrappings morning and night. She fed him broth before the others. She slept in short stretches beside him, waking to check if the cloth had stuck. Gaius and the younger ones took what work they could find, but the household’s earnings shrank until Lucius could stand again.

By 178 the plague years had eased, but other troubles remained. Poor harvest seasons returned in pulses—late frost, then a wet spring that spoiled grain in the ear. Grain prices climbed. Julia took more days in the fields, then paid for it. In 180, Sextus died at twenty-nine after a sudden fever. In 183, Tertia died at thirty. Julia stopped eating for days at a time, then forced herself to swallow soaked bread so she could keep moving.

In 178 she began to cough each winter, a hard cough that came with fever and weakness. Each cold season after that it returned. She shifted her work. She sorted olives, gathered kindling, and watched children while others carried heavier loads. She sat in a particular spot by the doorway in the late afternoon, where sun reached the packed earth, and there she shelled beans slowly, listening to the yard. She trusted Aurelia with small tasks and felt satisfaction when the jars were sealed cleanly and the measures were honest.

In her last years, Julia lived in a complex household. Aurelia had children of her own and stayed under the same roof with Julia and Gaius, pooling food and labor. Lucius, the son she had nursed through the leg infection, died in 187 at thirty-eight. Felix had already died at sixteen in 175. Julia’s cough persisted, and then a different pain settled in her body and did not leave. She kept her household rites at the hearth as long as she could stand.

Julia died on 1 December 192. A swelling in her body had grown for months, and by the end she could not rise to go out to the fields. Gaius and Aurelia’s household prepared her body and observed the rites they knew.
