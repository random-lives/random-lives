Ka was born on a clear day at the end of the dry season in the high country above the valleys of what is now southern Ecuador. His mother died with the birth. Women washed her and wrapped her, and the household moved through the first nights without her voice. Ka’s father, Mun, stayed in the same house and kept the children together. He spoke the local Palta tongue and answered to local leaders and kin councils rather than to any distant king. There was no Inca power in this land yet. Authority came from older men, from lineages, and from who could gather people for work.

By the time Ka could walk, the house held four children besides him. His older sisters, Mira and Wina, were already doing small tasks—carrying water, peeling tubers, keeping the fire alive when Mun went to the fields. There had been another baby boy born between Wina and Ka, but that child died before anyone took him far from the hearth. Ka grew up with that gap carried in the adults’ talk. A younger brother, Tal, came after Ka. Mun had five children to feed and no wife. His sisters and married cousins moved in and out, and a widowed aunt slept near the back wall for a season at a time, but the household still counted as one man’s house.

Mun farmed mixed plots on slopes and in flatter pockets where water held longer. Ka followed him early, stepping between plants and stones, hearing the instructions shouted over the wind. Mun planted in soil darkened by ash, worked ridges by hand, and kept stored seed in baskets that stayed off the ground. He expected Ka to learn by watching. Ka watched too much. He asked again and again what would happen if the rains failed, what would happen if the stored food molded, what would happen if someone took the seed. Mun answered once, then told him to carry water.

The seasons did not keep to a steady pattern. Some years the first rains came late and thin, and Mun replanted. Other years, showers came hard and early and tore at the slopes. Ka learned the feel of hungry weeks and the rules of sharing. When the stores ran low, Mun took part in work parties to clear another family’s field in exchange for food, and Ka went with him. Those days pulled families together, and the same hands also made the same threats. An argument over a boundary stone could last a year.

Sickness moved through the valley in waves. Ka got stomach illness twice as a small child. The first time he lay quiet and took broth until he stood again. The second time he cried out when his belly cramped and could not keep water down. Mun carried him to a curing specialist in a nearby settlement. The specialist rubbed his abdomen with heated stones and gave him a bitter drink. Ka lived. The illness took away his sister Mira the next season, before she reached adulthood. Her death left a hole in Mun’s labor plans and in Wina’s daily load.

When Ka was about sixteen, he began to break down in ways that made little sense to the people around him. He woke before dawn shaking and listening for footsteps that were not there. He checked the doorway again and again. He went to the fields and then turned back because he was sure he had left something undone, then he turned back again because he was sure he had done it wrong. He could not eat some days. He startled at small sounds. After a bout of respiratory illness that left him coughing and sweating for weeks, he stopped joining the household offerings at the field edges and the spring. He refused to touch the small piles of food and drink set aside for the spirits of water and soil.

Mun reacted with anger and then with fear. He wanted order. He wanted the rites done the way his parents had done them. Ka insisted on a different path. He went again to the curing specialist, a man called Saku, and stayed there for days at a time. Saku gave him protective rules. Ka tied a cord at his waist and kept it there. He avoided certain foods on certain days. He washed in a specific part of the stream, not at the spring. He spoke set phrases under his breath before entering a field. He followed these rules closely, and he pressed Mun’s household to let him do it. Mun allowed it when he saw Ka could work more steadily if he kept the taboos.

At seventeen, Ka left his hamlet for a period of communal labor on a hillside farther down-valley. Several households were repairing terraces and clearing brush after heavy rains had damaged the edges. Young men slept together in a rough shelter and ate from shared pots. Ka kept to the side, watched who laughed with whom, and measured his own speech. One evening he walked away from the fire with a young man from a nearby settlement, Kumari. They went behind the shelter where the ground was flat and the wind was blocked. They touched each other quickly and silently. Ka returned to the group and spent the night awake, listening for movement, sure someone had followed. No one confronted him. In the morning he worked hard until his hands bled.

Mun pushed Ka toward marriage after Ka turned twenty. Ka did not argue much. He did not choose openly, but he accepted a match with a woman from another household, Suwana. Her family held steady land and strong kin ties. The marriage brought Ka into closer obligation with Suwana’s parents, and after their first child was born—a daughter, Anaku—Ka moved into an extended household with his wife’s relatives. The house was larger, with more hands for cooking and more mouths for stored food. It also meant more eyes on him. He ate when others ate. He joined the work line without delay. He used Saku’s taboos quietly and did not explain them.

Ka farmed as his father had, but he kept his plots close. He avoided trips that took him far from home. He did not volunteer for guarding parties when rumors of raiding spread. He carried water, repaired ditches, and watched for mold in the storage baskets. When illness passed through again, he kept Anaku away from the sick and insisted on boiling certain plants for her drink. Suwana’s mother argued with him over it, and he snapped once, sharp and loud, then apologized with food the next day. He seldom fought with his fists. He fought with rules.

Rainfall shifted again in his late twenties. Planting dates slipped, and the yields came uneven. The household leaned more on exchanges with kin and on storing whatever could be dried. Ka’s worry became constant. He checked the seed baskets repeatedly. He paced at night and listened to dogs. Suwana slept with Anaku and did not try to pull him down beside her. Ka ate little and worked until he shook.

He died on a day when the fields were quiet and the household was inside. Ka went out alone behind the outbuildings where tools were kept. He used a rope and a beam. Someone found him there and cut him down, but he was already dead. He was thirty years old.
