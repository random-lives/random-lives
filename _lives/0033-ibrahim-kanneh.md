Ibrahim Kanneh was born near the end of the rains in 2005 in Foya Tewei, a small farming settlement in Moyamba District. Houses sat back from a laterite road. Cassava grew close to the compounds, and rice fields started where the bush thickened. In his family yard there were always voices. His parents lived with their children and an older relative who moved slowly and listened to everything. Ibrahim came sixth. Another child came after him. Before him there had been a baby who died before the first year. Years later a brother died at twelve. No one spoke long about either. The missing ones still showed up in small ways: a plate not set out, rice measured without extra.

His father farmed upland rice, cassava, and groundnuts when the soil held. When a buyer came through, he tried a little of whatever would bring cash. His mother worked longer than anyone, cooking, hauling water, weeding, and keeping the youngest from wandering into the fire. Money came in short pieces: palm oil sold in a bottle, a chicken sold when school fees were due, a bag of produce carried to the road.

Ibrahim learned early that the work started before talk. If someone said first light, he was already up. He sharpened a cutlass until the edge caught the skin of his thumb. He liked people watching him begin. He also liked being the one who corrected others, even elders, if he thought they were being careless.

In the village he spoke Mende. Krio came from the radio and from people who moved between villages and town. He picked it up fast and used it to sound older than he was. English came in school. He could read simple lines if he went slow and traced with a finger. Writing stayed rough. He copied words like drawings and left out letters when he got tired. When a teacher made him redo a page, he did it without apology and without thanks, staying until the exercise book looked clean.

He was Muslim like his parents. On Fridays he followed his father to the mosque and learned the quiet parts: when to stand, when to lower his eyes, when not to speak. At home there were other protections too. Cloth bundles were tied and kept out of children’s hands. Water was prayed over. When someone fell sick, an older person gave instructions that were treated like rules. Ibrahim did not argue with any of it. If he was told to wash, he washed.

In 2014 the talk changed. Ebola arrived first as radio messages and names of places where people had died. Then it came closer. A handwashing bucket appeared at the edge of the yard and stayed there. People stopped shaking hands. School closed for months. Ibrahim hated sitting. He found work anyway—carrying water, clearing brush, holding a younger child on his back so his mother could finish cooking. He did not panic, but he watched everyone. When an uncle walked past the bucket, Ibrahim called him back in Krio and pointed until the man washed, irritated and silent. He learned what could pause and what could not. Rice still needed weeding. Firewood still needed cutting. You just did it with space between bodies, with less visiting, with fewer jokes.

When school started again, he went back with a harder face. Older siblings were already pulling away—one staying with relatives for work, another spending more time near town—so Ibrahim attached himself to older men in the family. He listened. He also talked too much. He could move between boys and elders and keep both sides laughing, and he remembered every small promise.

He also took things.

If a cousin left a phone card on a bench, Ibrahim used it and said he thought it was his. If a neighbor’s mangoes hung over the path, he picked them without asking and ate them walking. When confronted, he did not look ashamed. He argued details. He said he would replace it later. Sometimes he did, sometimes he didn’t. People learned to count their small items around him and still called him for work because he showed up.

At thirteen, during the 2018 election season, motorbikes brought party men down the road. A megaphone blared slogans in the afternoon heat. Men argued under the trees about who had helped them after the war and who would fix the road. Ibrahim repeated lines he heard because he liked the feeling of people turning their heads. At a roadside stall he shouted a slogan and laughed, and an older cousin caught his shirt and pulled him close.

“Yu wan mek trouble for free?” the cousin hissed.

Ibrahim went quiet. Later he complained at home, not about politics, but about being handled in public like a small boy. His mother told him that a mouth that runs brings a hand to stop it.

As a teenager he split his time. He spent stretches in a nearby town with relatives, sleeping on a mat in a back room, running errands, carrying loads, helping on farm plots. He returned to Foya Tewei for planting and harvest. Town taught him prices and how fast they moved. One week a bag of rice cost one thing, the next week another, because fuel was short or the road was cut. He learned which traders paid late and which ones cheated weight. He bargained with older women who didn’t let a boy win unless he pushed hard.

COVID came when he was fourteen. The market thinned. Some days the town felt closed without being closed. School stopped and started. At the mosque, spacing and caution returned, and people watched who coughed. Ibrahim reacted by tightening his own system. He kept torn pages from an exercise book folded in his pocket. On them he wrote names, phone numbers, days worked, and small debts in uneven English and Krio spellings that only he could read back. He didn’t write well, but he wrote enough to argue.

“Ah get am ya so,” he would say, tapping the paper with a dirty thumb when someone claimed they had already paid.

In one rainy season a flood broke the path to the fields. Water ran hard for two days and the laterite turned to paste. A small footbridge gave way and lay twisted in the mud. Some men waited for it to dry. Ibrahim didn’t. He gathered boys, cut poles, and went to an older cousin’s yard to demand nails.

The cousin said no.

Ibrahim stood there and talked over him until the cousin stopped talking back. He did not threaten. He just stayed, loud and smiling, making it hard for the cousin to end the conversation without losing face. The nails came out in the end. They laid planks and poles and made a crossing that held long enough to move cassava and tools. Elders praised the boys. Ibrahim accepted the praise like payment he had already earned.

From 2021 onward the prices climbed and didn’t come back down. Imported rice, oil, soap, school supplies. Fuel jumped and transport got harder. Buyers offered less for produce and said it was the road, it was the fuel, it was their own losses. Shopkeepers still wanted full money. Ibrahim changed how he sold. He stored what he could—dried cassava, a little palm oil—waiting for a better day. He tried to sell in town instead of in the village when he could get a ride. He started putting more care into a small cash-crop plot he gained through family ties, negotiated through elders but pushed forward by him. He went in person, sat through the talk, and stated his terms plainly. After the agreement, he cleared the plot himself and kept it clean. People did not trust him with loose money, but they trusted his hands to work.

His lack of fear showed in ordinary moments. When an okada skidded in the market sand and men jumped back, Ibrahim stepped in to lift it, calm, fingers under the metal, steady as if it was his own bike. When people talked about the future like it was a wall, he shrugged and went back to the field. He slept easily. He also got angry fast when he felt cheated.

Once, an older boy accused him of shorting a measure of palm oil. Ibrahim answered right there at the stall, voice rising, smiling like he was enjoying it. A small crowd formed. Older women told both of them to stop spoiling trade. Ibrahim poured back a little extra oil to end the argument and walked away with his chin high. Later he told a friend he had paid only to shut mouths, not because the boy was right.

By 2023, during another election season, he was old enough to be taken seriously. He went to a meeting in town where a local figure promised road work and youth opportunities. Ibrahim waited through the speeches. When it opened for questions, he asked about fertilizer prices and where a farmer was supposed to find a buyer who wouldn’t cut the price at the last minute. Men laughed at his directness. He kept his face flat and asked again.

After the meeting an older farmer slapped his shoulder and said, “You dae ask question like big man.”

Ibrahim repeated that line later in the village, not as a joke, but as proof.

At twenty he was still unmarried and not living with a partner. He had no children. People mentioned it, mostly as advice: don’t tie yourself to costs you can’t carry. He moved between the town edge and his family land, farming as his main work and using town contacts to buy and sell. He prayed when it was time, not perfectly, but enough that the older men expected to see him. His English stayed limited. He read signs. He could handle a simple message. When forms and official writing came up, he brought someone who wrote cleanly and stood close enough to watch.

One late afternoon in the dry season he returned from town with a small sack of seed rice on his head, dust on his sandals. In the yard his mother sorted peppers into a bowl. An uncle sat in the shade with a radio turned low. Ibrahim greeted in Mende, then switched to Krio to report the market—who was buying, who was lying, what the price was that day. He washed at the bucket by the doorway. He sat on the bench and began picking stones from the rice with quick fingers, talking as he worked. The sky darkened over the palms. The radio hissed between stations. He kept sorting until the sack was clean.
