He was never entered on the household register with a personal name. For the hours he lived, they called him Fourth Son.

He was born before dawn on January 30, 1137, in a hamlet of mud-walled houses on a wooded slope above the river. The family’s days turned on dues of grain and cloth, the risk of theft on the road to the market town, and whether the salt carriers arrived on time. His father worked their own narrow strips cut into the mountain and kept seed grain in a sealed jar under the bed. His mother had spent the winter spinning hemp thread by the light of an oil lamp, then went out on clear days to hoe the ridges.

They lived in a single courtyard with his father’s parents. The old woman kept a fresh strip of paper for the Kitchen God above the stove and snapped at the children when they dragged mud over the threshold.

They had already buried one newborn boy. Their little girl had died at five in a sudden fever. One son remained, quiet and quick with chores, carrying water and splitting kindling without being asked.

This labor went badly from the start. The pains came strong, then stalled. By midmorning the women sent the older boy to the market village for a Daoist ritual specialist. He arrived with a cloth bundle, took out a small bell and yellow talisman papers, and tied a charm to the bedframe. He rang the bell in short strokes and spoke the words close to his breath while a bowl of hot water steamed by the mat.

When the child finally came, he was limp and silent. They wiped his face clean, rubbed his chest and back hard, and warmed him against his mother’s skin. His head lolled. He never drew a full breath.

By midday his skin turned cold and his jaw tightened. The room filled again with the usual sounds: the old woman stirring millet at the hearth, the quiet boy outside stacking split wood, the oil lamp being pinched out to save the wick.
