#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Fewer protective social ties and fewer chances at advancement through
#       patronage; when crisis hits, he has a narrower set of people to ask for help,
#       increasing the likelihood of child dispersal.
#     scene: At the mine and in the lodging yard he speaks little, avoids tavern sociability,
#       and prefers solitary tasks (tool cleaning, patching clothes) over joining loud
#       groups; he relies on one trusted brother rather than broad networks.
#     timing: adolescence through adulthood (ages 15-36)
#     trait: Extraversion (very low)
#   - consequence: Maintains a reputation for decency but sacrifices small illicit coping
#       strategies that might have buffered poverty; leaves him more exposed to debt
#       and eviction.
#     scene: During food-price spikes he refuses to short-weight coal or take materials
#       from the pit, even when co-workers do; he is uncomfortable lying to creditors
#       or officials and instead accepts humiliating pawnshop terms.
#     timing: adulthood, especially crisis years (ages 25-36)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (very high)
#   - consequence: Reinforces staying local and occupational continuity in mining; reduces
#       flexibility when the household needs a drastic change after widowhood.
#     scene: He sticks to familiar parish customs and local routines, distrusts new
#       political talk and 'clever' schemes, and is reluctant to try distant job opportunities
#       or join novel associations.
#     timing: young adulthood (ages 18-30)
#     trait: Openness (low-ish)
# number_of_children: '5'
# number_of_siblings: '5'
# occupation: Coal miner (underground or surface mine worker)
# religion: 'Mainstream parish Catholic practice: Sunday/feast Mass fairly regular;
#   confession/Communion mainly at Easter/major feasts; observes Lent/fasts; household
#   prayers/icons'

# - 0
# - 0
# - 79
# sibling_sexes:

# - F
# - M
# - F
# structured_incidents:
# - event: After his wife died, he fell behind on rent and food debts and had to pawn
#     household goods and miss workdays at the mine/works, leading to eviction from
#     his lodging and relying on relatives to take some of the children.
#   reasoning: He is already characterized as precarious/poor with irregular work and
#     housing insecurity, and widowhood plus multiple children commonly produced debt
#     and near-destitution episodes.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 32–34 (c. 1893–1895)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: He was beaten in a street/tavern fight near the works after a wage or drinking
#     dispute, suffering bruised ribs and a head wound that kept him from work for several
#     days.
#   reasoning: Among working-class men in dense industrial towns, non-domestic assaults
#     and serious fights (street, tavern, workplace disputes) were the most common violence
#     exposures, making this the most likely subtype given victimization occurred.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 28–30 (c. 1889–1891)
#   type: physical_assault
# - event: He took in and helped raise a deceased sibling’s child for a period, sending
#     the child to live with his own relatives when his finances collapsed after being
#     widowed.
#   reasoning: He had five biological children and became a widower; major caregiving
#     is more likely to reflect caring for his own children (not counted here) than
#     taking in others, though taking in a niece/nephew could happen.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 31–35 (c. 1892–1896)
#   type: orphaned_children

Stanisław Kamiński was born on January 11, 1861, in Czeladź, a small town in the Dąbrowa Basin of Congress Poland, ruled by the Russian Empire. His family spoke Polish at home and prayed in a Roman Catholic parish where the calendar of fasts and feasts set the pace of weeks more reliably than the orders posted by officials.

His father earned wages in local industry and his mother also worked for pay, leaving the older children to carry errands and mind the younger ones. Stanisław grew up in a two-parent home that filled quickly. His older brother Józef arrived first, then Stanisław, then sisters Katarzyna and later Zofia. Two babies came between them and died in the year they were born: a sister in 1866 and a brother in 1868. The household kept holy pictures and a crucifix, and his mother insisted on prayers before sleep. On Sundays they went to Mass when work allowed, and Stanisław learned the feel of kneeling and the smell of damp wool in a crowded church.

Russian authority showed itself in small ways. Men in uniform on the road. A clerk’s stamp on a paper that decided whether a family could keep a room. The language on signs and forms that did not match the language spoken in the yard. Stanisław did not take to school. He did not learn to read, and by the time he was ten he was already useful in ways a classroom could not match. He carried coal, fetched water, and walked messages to neighbors. He spoke little, and he listened more than he asked questions. When a job needed a boy to stand quietly and wait, he was chosen.

By the 1870s the region changed fast. Shafts, spoil heaps, and rail sidings spread across fields. New brick buildings rose, and so did rows of cramped worker housing. Józef went into wage work early. Stanisław followed. As a teenager he took whatever labor came—hauling, loading, sweeping—until the mine work became his steady path. He learned the routine of a shift and the tight rules of a foreman. A man called Majster Kowal ran his gang with a short temper and a sharp ear for excuses. Stanisław kept his cap in his hands when spoken to and answered with a few words. He saved his breath for the underground.

He kept small habits that suited him. He rose before daylight, made the sign of the cross, and ate bread with lard or a bit of cheese when there was any. He liked hot soup more than anything else, especially kapuśniak when cabbage was cheap. After work he sat on a low step in the yard rather than crowding into a noisy room. Once a week he took a mug of beer with two other men he trusted, one a fellow miner named Franciszek Wrona. Their talk stayed on wages, foremen, and who was sick. Tuberculosis was always there; one week a cough was only a cough, the next week it meant a bed in a corner and a priest called for confession.

In 1883, at twenty-two, he married Marianna, a Polish Catholic woman from the same area. The wedding was church-centered and practical, with relatives crowding into borrowed space. Marianna ran the household with firm hands. She kept a small tin box for coins and tried to pay debts before they grew teeth. Stanisław brought wages home in his pocket, folded into a scrap of cloth. He did not gamble. He did not boast. He counted money carefully even without letters, using stacks and memory, and he disliked borrowing unless forced.

Their first daughter, Anna, was born in 1884. A second daughter, Helena, followed in 1886. In 1888 they had a son, Jan. The rooms they could afford were tight, and the children slept close. Winters were hard, with damp air that stuck to the walls. In years when harvests failed and food prices jumped, Marianna watered soup and stretched flour. Stanisław took extra shifts when he could and brought home coal dust in his eyebrows and the creak of tired joints in his knees.

In 1890, a wage dispute turned into a beating. Stanisław went with Franciszek Wrona to a tavern near the works after pay was cut again. The room was full of men arguing over the price of bread and the foreman’s favorites. Someone accused Stanisław of taking a better place in the line. He answered sharply, the tone he used when pushed too far, and a fist caught him on the cheek. Two men held him while another drove a knee into his ribs. He walked home with a head wound that bled through a cloth and bruises that made breathing a task. He stayed off work for days, and the missed wages pushed the household into debt with the shopkeeper.

That same year Marianna gave birth to another son, Michał. The baby died in 1891, before he reached his second birthday. The priest came, prayers were said, and the child was buried without the household ever feeling steady again. Stanisław returned to work quickly. He avoided the tavern after that. He still met Franciszek sometimes, but in quieter places, standing by the fence at the edge of the yard, sharing news without raising their voices.

In 1892, Marianna bore their fifth child, a son they named Paweł. She died that year. Her death tore out the center of the household. Stanisław kept attending Sunday Mass and kept the Easter confession and Communion, but now he went with children clinging to his coat and no one to manage the home while he worked. Anna was eight and Helena six; they learned to watch the baby and stir pots. Stanisław asked his sister Katarzyna to come often. She helped with washing and with keeping Paweł warm when the weather turned.

Also in 1892, a close blow came from his own kin. A child of his family line—his niece, Zuzanna, born to a sibling who died—needed a place. Stanisław took her in. It made the rooms tighter and the food thinner, but he did it without bargaining. When other men joked that he had taken on another mouth for nothing, he did not answer.

In 1894, the debts finally crushed the household. Food prices rose again, and mine work turned irregular. Stanisław missed shifts because one child was sick, then because he had to queue for relief from a parish charity, then because his ribs never fully stopped aching when he lifted. The landlord wanted rent. Stanisław took Marianna’s shawl and a small iron pot to the pawnbroker. He sold a blanket. He delayed paying the baker and the butcher until they refused him. In the end the family was put out of their lodging. Józef stepped in, angry but steady, and arranged places for the children. Anna went with a relative; Helena went to Katarzyna. Jan moved between households, old enough to be useful. Baby Paweł was sent to kin for daily care. Zuzanna was sent away as well, placed with other relatives when Stanisław could no longer feed her.

Stanisław lived for a time in a shared room with other men, paying by the week. He worked when he could, kept his head down, and brought coins to his brother for the children. He did not talk politics. He avoided officials and any gathering that drew police attention. He kept a routine of prayer, a quick sign of the cross before descending, a short kneel in church when time allowed.

On June 10, 1897, he died in a mining accident. A fall of material in the workings crushed him during his shift. He was thirty-six. The parish handled the burial rites, and his children remained in the care of relatives already holding their lives together.
