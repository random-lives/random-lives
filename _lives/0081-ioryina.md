# ethnicity: Tiv
# father_occupation: Trader/merchant (buying/selling farm produce or general goods;
#   shopkeeper/market trader)
# historical_context:
# - event: Nigeria’s high inflation and currency instability (naira depreciation) raising
#     prices of food, fuel, fertilizers, and school supplies, squeezing even relatively
#     secure rural households.
#   timing: Age 6–9 (2022–2025)
# - event: Seasonal climate variability and extreme rainfall patterns affecting rainfed
#     crops (late/early rains, localized crop losses), influencing household food prices
#     and farm labor demands.
#   timing: Repeated seasons across age 0–9 (2016–2025)
# - event: Flooding episodes in Benue basin systems (including years when flooding was
#     widely reported in Nigeria), damaging fields/roads and disrupting local transport
#     and markets.
#   timing: Most plausibly age 2–3 (2018–2019) and/or age 6 (2022)
# household_social_status: Middle (notable local business/civil service; strong asset
#   base; education for children largely assured)
# household_structure_at_birth: Married monogamous couple household (father and mother
#   co-resident) with many children
# language: Tiv + Nigerian English + Nigerian Pidgin

#       and how to keep small notes for sales.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Mker
#     narrative_role: Runs a trading-and-farming mix while managing a very large household.

#   incident_placements:

#     connection: Placed shortly after a busy market period when the father returns
#       with more cash than usual; inflation and cash scarcity make the loss feel larger

#       with a trusted neighbor overnight).

#     narrative_role: Newest infant during Ioryina’s award period; symbolizes the household’s
#       continuing growth and the expectation that the older children will be disciplined
#       and responsible.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Teachers trust him with class monitor tasks and his parents give
#       him more responsibility; siblings sometimes resent his strictness.
#     scene: Before dawn he packs his exercise books, sharpens a pencil with a razor
#       blade carefully, and insists on finishing sweeping the compound before leaving—returning
#       if he notices a missed corner.
#     timing: Ages 6–9 (primary school years, especially 2022–2025)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (100th percentile)
#   - consequence: Adults see him as trustworthy and he is given errands involving money;
#       peers may tease him as naïve.
#     scene: When sent to buy small items, he returns exact change and admits openly
#       when he miscounted, even though he could hide it; he refuses friends’ suggestions
#       to 'take small' from his father’s trading money.
#     timing: Ages 7–9 (2023–2025)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (91st percentile)
#   - consequence: Occasional conflict with peers and siblings; he gains a reputation
#       as serious and stubborn but reliable.
#     scene: He corrects siblings sharply—'Do it again, it’s not clean'—and argues with
#       a classmate over rules in a game, preferring strict fairness over keeping peace.
#     timing: Ages 5–9 (2021–2025)
#     trait: Agreeableness low (27th percentile)
#   - consequence: Adapts slowly to changes like altered school schedules or new teaching
#       methods, but once learned he follows them diligently.
#     scene: He prefers familiar routines—same path to school, same study corner—and
#       is skeptical of new fads or stories, focusing instead on practical tasks and
#       what elders/teachers say is correct.
#     timing: Ages 6–10 (2022–early 2026)
#     trait: Openness low-moderate (34th percentile)
#   - consequence: Ends up ‘solid’ rather than naturally quick; achievement comes from
#       effort and teacher guidance, matching his partial writing ability despite some
#       reading skill.
#     scene: He memorizes by repetition and neat copying rather than quick inference;
#       he may need extra time with English spelling and word problems but compensates
#       by practicing every evening.
#     timing: Ages 7–10 (2023–early 2026)
#     trait: Intelligence (26th percentile) / learning pace
#   - consequence: Adults lean on him as a stabilizing presence; he may under-express
#       worry and instead become rigid about routines.
#     scene: During tense weeks after the theft and during price spikes, he stays calm,
#       follows new rules, and focuses on tasks instead of panicking—more irritated
#       than anxious.
#     timing: Age 7 (2023–2024) and age 8–9 (2024–2025)
#     trait: Neuroticism low (23rd percentile)
# number_of_siblings: 10+
# religion: Primarily traditional Tiv religion/ritual (offerings/ritual specialists;
#   limited/no church participation)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: A phone and some cash from his father’s small trading proceeds were stolen
#     from their home/compound after a busy market day, likely by someone who knew the
#     family’s routines; it led to a tense few weeks and extra caution about where money
#     and goods were kept.
#   reasoning: Rural households commonly experience some theft (farm produce, small
#     livestock, phones/cash) even if not always formally reported; a middle-status
#     trading family may have more attractive goods/cash flow.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Age 7–8 (2023–2024); single event
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: He placed near the top of his primary-school class and was publicly recognized
#     at end‑of‑term assembly (certificate/prize), with his parents praised for keeping
#     him consistent in school despite farm and market work at home.
#   reasoning: By age ~9–10, notable recognized achievements are usually limited to
#     local school or church/community distinctions; high conscientiousness raises odds
#     but opportunities are constrained in rural areas.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Age 8–9 (2024–2025); recurring pattern (at least two terms)
#   type: major_achievement

Ioryina was born on March 11, 2016, in Katsina-Ala in Benue State, under Nigeria’s federal government. He grew up in a Tiv-speaking compound where his parents kept to Tiv ritual ways more than church life, even though the children spoke English and Pidgin at school and in town.

His father, Aondohemba, traded on market days, moving yams, rice, and small household goods between villages and larger stalls. His mother, Mker, kept a small spread of items and still farmed, planting and weeding around the seasons. The compound stayed full. Two older sisters, Mlumun and Doosuur, were already old enough to carry water and watch toddlers. After Ioryina came Kpadoo, then Teryima, then Nguwase, Shior, Terna, Akor, Iveren, and finally Tyoakaa. With eleven children, the older ones learned schedules by force of numbers.

When school began to matter, Ioryina turned it into a set of rules. Before dawn he swept the yard corners until the dirt lines looked straight, then packed his books the same way each day. If a younger child spilled water, he snapped instructions and made them wipe it again. At school Mr. Ikyur put him in front to collect exercise books because he counted twice and never “forgot” change from errands. He copied words carefully, reading better than he wrote; spelling took him three tries, and he stayed to practice.

During the COVID closures in 2020, he sat on a low bench and repeated lessons aloud while Shior cried on a mat nearby. The rains shifted in later years, and planting dates argued about in the evenings.

One evening in August 2023, after Aondohemba returned from market, the family discovered his phone and some cash missing from the room where he kept trading money. Mama Aker at the market warned Mker to stop leaving money where visitors could see it. Aondohemba began locking the door and storing cash inside a tin placed under grain sacks.

In June 2024, Ioryina’s name was called at assembly for placing near the top of his class. He received a certificate and a bar of soap as a prize, then did it again the next term.

By late 2025 he is ten, still in Katsina-Ala, reading short passages in English, writing slowly in cramped lines, and walking home to a compound that smells of cassava drying and kerosene smoke.
