#     trait: Low Extraversion (21st percentile)
#   - consequence: Stability and predictability in work; slower adaptation during bad
#       years (hesitant to shift crops or practices).

#     timing: ages 10-28
#     trait: High Conscientiousness (69th percentile)
#   - consequence: Occasional friction with neighbors/official intermediaries; increases
#       risk of dispute but also helps household survive tight years.

# structured_incidents:
# - event: After a weak monsoon and a poor harvest, the household had to borrow grain

#     and spent the next seasons repaying in grain and labor.
#   reasoning: Despite starting better-off, households were vulnerable to crop failure,
#     disease in draft animals, and debt; however his adult standing remained similar
#     to birth, implying major ruin was less likely.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 22–24
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: While still unmarried, he had a brief consensual relationship with a young
#     woman from a nearby hamlet during festival gatherings, meeting secretly at the
#     edge of the fields at night to avoid gossip and retaliation from kin.
#   reasoning: Even with strong marriage norms, some men had consensual sex before formal
#     marriage (with peers, servants, or partners later married); opportunity exists
#     in village life and during festivals/market travel.

Rudrasena was born into an Indo-Aryan-speaking farming family on the wooded edge of the Middle Ganga country, when Mauryan officers and their local intermediaries reached deep into villages to measure fields, collect revenues, and requisition grain and transport animals. His people spoke a local Middle Indo-Aryan vernacular and kept household rites: lamp and food offerings, vows at shrines, and funerary observances for kin.

His father, Dhanamitra, worked as a substantial cultivator. Two oxen pulled the plough, and hired hands appeared at peak moments when the family needed more hands than sons could provide. Gauri, his mother, ran the household stores and the daily round—grinding grain, boiling pulses, keeping the hearth, drying fodder, and setting out a small offering near the threshold before dawn. Rudrasena grew up in a nuclear household: father, mother, and the children under one roof and within one yard wall, without grandparents living with them.

He was the fifth child, and every older sibling was a boy. Bhadraka, the eldest, already carried himself like a man when Rudrasena was small, handing down commands in a tone he had learned from their father. Somadeva, born after an infant brother who died, stayed close to the work and talked more than Rudrasena did, often narrating what he saw. Another brother had been born and lost in infancy before Rudrasena arrived. Those deaths sat inside the family’s routine. Gauri kept certain days for ancestor rites and took Rudrasena by the wrist to touch water to the ground for the dead children whose names were spoken softly and rarely.

Fevers returned after the rains. Some years they struck lightly; other years they emptied the lanes and left adults shivering on charpoys while the smallest children carried water. When Rudrasena was five, Gauri kept him inside for several days after a neighbor’s child died of loose stool and vomiting. She boiled water longer than usual, scolded boys for drinking from the canal, and set extra flowers at the village shrine.

At seven he began to take regular tasks. He led calves away from the threshing floor, carried dung cakes to dry, and learned to keep his hands calm near an ox’s horns. He liked early morning best, when the air was cooler and the birds quieted, and the work was simple: lifting water, checking a knot, walking behind a slow animal. When he felt watched, he became stiff and short-spoken. He avoided the boys who shouted and wrestled, and he let Somadeva answer questions at gatherings.

By twelve he went to periodic markets with his father and brothers. The road traffic had grown heavier than it had been in Dhanamitra’s youth. Pack animals moved with salt, cloth, and iron, and officials traveled with clerks and guards. Rudrasena listened more than he spoke. He studied how his father checked weights and smelled grain, and he learned the names of a few coin types without ever learning to read the marks. At the market he stayed close to the family’s sacks and to the oxen. Somadeva teased him for it once, calling him an old man. Rudrasena answered with a hard look and a shove that started a brief scuffle before Dhanamitra separated them.

When Rudrasena was fifteen, a Mauryan intermediary, Visakha, arrived with men to assess fields and collect dues. The visit pulled labor away from the farm at a bad moment. A cart and a pair of oxen were demanded for transport for a day. Bhadraka argued loudly, then complied. Rudrasena did not argue. He took the yoke strap and checked it twice, then sat at the cart’s side through the midday heat, eyes down, jaw tight. That evening he placed an extra small offering at the threshold without being asked, then washed his hands carefully at the well.

At seventeen, during festival gatherings that drew people from nearby hamlets, he started meeting Padma, a young woman whose family lived beyond the next set of fields. They spoke in short phrases, and most of their time together was silence and touch. He chose places away from paths: the edge of the fallow strip where scrub met wheat stubble, a shallow ditch lined with grass. He went at night, returning before dawn. He kept the meetings from Somadeva and from his mother. Once, when a cousin asked why he had been out late, Rudrasena’s answer came too sharp and too quick, and it drew attention. After that he became even more careful, leaving his sandals behind and walking barefoot over cool soil.

The relationship ended when marriage negotiations began in earnest. Bhadraka and Dhanamitra chose Satyavati, a girl from a nearby village, for a match that tightened local ties. Rudrasena accepted the decision with little talk. He stopped meeting Padma and avoided the festival grounds for a season, staying near the granary and the cattle shed. When Padma crossed his path at a water source, he looked past her and spoke only a greeting.

Rudrasena married Satyavati at nineteen. The marriage brought ritual obligations and new routines: gifts exchanged, a feast with sweetened milk and fried breads, and household prayers for fertility and protection. Satyavati moved into the family compound. Rudrasena treated her with a guarded steadiness. He spoke more at home than he did in public, but even there he measured his words. He took pride in small competencies—setting a straight furrow, keeping seed dry through sudden showers, and noticing when an ox’s gait changed. Satyavati learned to read his temper by his hands: when he retied a rope three times, he was uneasy.

At twenty-one, as Bhadraka’s authority in the wider kin group settled, Rudrasena’s household arrangement shifted. He and Satyavati lived with Dhanamitra and Gauri in a stem household, while older brothers spent more time managing their own affairs and labor networks. Rudrasena remained central to daily fieldwork and supervision of hired hands, especially when older brothers were away negotiating or attending village meetings.

When he was twenty-two, the rains weakened and the harvest fell short. Grain prices rose at the market, and lenders tightened their terms. Visakha’s demands did not shrink. Dhanamitra borrowed grain and silver from Kautika, a local moneylender who kept his storehouse guarded and his accounts in the hands of a scribe. Rudrasena helped carry sacks to Kautika’s courtyard and watched the weighing with an unblinking stare. He tried to follow the spoken terms and missed parts of it; afterwards he asked Somadeva to repeat what had been agreed, then snapped when Somadeva corrected him.

In the second year of that hardship, one of the household oxen fell ill. The animal’s breath came fast, and its flanks hollowed despite fodder and herbs. Without that ox, ploughing slowed and the hired labor cost more. To keep seed for the next sowing and to meet revenue demands, Dhanamitra pawned a portion of the household’s land-use rights. The repayment was set partly in grain and partly in labor. Rudrasena coordinated the labor days. He rose before dawn, walked to the lender’s fields, and worked beside men who watched him for any sign of weakness. He cut and carried, repaired bunds, and kept his anger behind clenched teeth when someone called him “younger son” with a laugh.

During that same period he had a serious health incident that did not end his life. After the post-monsoon fevers swept the area, he spent days with chills and aching joints, then returned to the fields too soon. The weakness lingered. He worked anyway, sleeping poorly and checking the granary after dark, lifting the lid and smelling for damp.

By twenty-six the debt burden eased, though the pawned rights remained a sore point in family arguments. Rudrasena and Satyavati had no live-born children. Gauri pressed her with quiet questions and extra offerings. Rudrasena reacted with irritation and walked out to the cattle shed when the talk began, scraping dried mud from a ploughshare long after it was clean.

He died at twenty-eight in a farm accident. During field work he handled an ox that had grown skittish, and when it lunged the yoke swung hard. The impact knocked him down and crushed him against the packed earth. Men dragged the animal back and carried Rudrasena into the yard, but the injury ended his life that day, leaving the household to finish the season’s work without him.
