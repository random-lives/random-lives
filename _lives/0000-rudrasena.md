#   - consequence: Occasional friction with neighbors/official intermediaries; increases

# structured_incidents:
# - event: After a weak monsoon and a poor harvest, the household had to borrow grain

#   reasoning: Despite starting better-off, households were vulnerable to crop failure,
#     disease in draft animals, and debt; however his adult standing remained similar

#   timing: ages 22–24

# - event: While still unmarried, he had a brief consensual relationship with a young

#     edge of the fields at night to avoid gossip and retaliation from kin.
#   reasoning: Even with strong marriage norms, some men had consensual sex before formal

Rudrasena was born on a cool morning in February of 290 BC in a farming hamlet south of the Ganga plain, where the forest still pressed close to the fields. The Mauryan Empire governed the region through officials who measured land, assessed grain, and sent messages along roads that linked villages to market towns and river crossings. Rudrasena’s family spoke an Indo‑Aryan vernacular and kept the household rites of the village: offerings at the cooking fire, water poured for ancestors, and yearly festivals for the local protective powers.

His father, Dhanamitra, owned oxen and a plough and held enough land to hire extra hands during harvest. His mother, Gauri, ran the household stores and the daily routine—grinding grain, keeping the hearth, feeding workers, and tending the small animals that lived close to the house. Rudrasena was the fifth child she carried to term. Two sons had been born before him and died in infancy; their names were not spoken casually, but they were not forgotten. At certain rites Gauri set out a little extra cooked rice and clarified butter, and she watched the younger children closely afterward.

The living brothers set the shape of Rudrasena’s childhood. Bhadraka, the eldest, moved through the homestead like a second father, giving orders to hired hands and arguing with neighbors over field boundaries. Somadeva, younger than Bhadraka but still much older than Rudrasena, worked steadily and talked less. Nandaka came after Rudrasena, small enough that Rudrasena carried him on his hip when their mother’s hands were full.

Their household at the start was a single unit—parents and children under one roof and in one yard. Rudrasena slept on mats with his brothers and woke before sunrise when his mother stirred the coals. He followed Dhanamitra to the fields and learned to keep his distance from the oxen’s horns. In the weeks after the rains, fevers moved through the village. A child would shiver and sweat, then recover, then fall sick again. In one season Rudrasena spent days lying under a thin cloth while Gauri pressed bitter leaves into a drink and made a small vow at a nearby shrine: a pot of milk offered if the fever broke. It did, and he returned to work thinner and quieter, with a habit of checking his own skin for heat when the evenings turned damp.

By the time Rudrasena was seven, he carried water jars from the well and took cooked food out to the men in the fields. He learned the order of work by watching: when to open the grain store, when to smear mud on a cracked wall before the next rain, when to bring the oxen in early because their breathing sounded wrong. He did not talk much with strangers. On days when travelers came along the road—state messengers, traders, men leading pack animals—he stood back by the fence and watched, letting Bhadraka handle the greetings.

When Rudrasena reached twelve, Dhanamitra began taking him to the periodic market. The road had been improved and kept clear; there were more carts and more soldiers and guards than in Dhanamitra’s own youth. At the market Rudrasena helped load sacks, held the rope of a goat, and carried back salt and iron fittings. Bargaining annoyed him. He did not enjoy loud talk or playful insults between traders. He kept his eyes on weights and measures instead, and he remembered who tried to short them.

As Rudrasena grew, Mauryan officials appeared more often. A man called Mahamatta Visakha came with clerks and guards to count oxen and record fields for assessment. Visakha spoke in an official tone, demanded water, and asked for transport animals when a convoy needed to move. Dhanamitra complied and complained afterward, when only family and trusted neighbors could hear. Rudrasena listened and learned who mattered in the village, and which disputes were worth speaking aloud.

In 273 BC, when Rudrasena was seventeen, the village held a festival that drew people from surrounding hamlets. There was drumming, games, and a temporary stall where sweet cakes were fried in ghee. Rudrasena ate two and felt sick from the richness, then sat in the shade behind a storage shed to let the heat pass. A girl from a nearby hamlet, Padma, found him there. She brought him water and laughed at his face when he tried to pretend he had not overeaten. He met her again in the evening, away from the crowded lanes. After that, for a short season, they found each other at the edge of the fields after dark, speaking little, touching quickly, always listening for footsteps. Rudrasena kept his sandals in his hand so they would not scuff on dry ground. The secrecy thrilled him and also made him sharp and irritable at home. Once Bhadraka mocked him for wandering off during the festival, and Rudrasena answered too fast and too harshly, earning a slap and a warning.

The relationship ended in 272 BC when Dhanamitra accepted a marriage arrangement with a family that owned fields near theirs. Rudrasena did not protest openly. He went out before dawn and ploughed as if he could carve his thoughts into the earth. Padma avoided the village road when she came to market. Rudrasena kept his face still when he saw her, then later washed his hands longer than needed at the well.

In 270 BC Rudrasena married Satyavati. She arrived with pots, bedding, and a small bundle of cloth, and she learned Gauri’s rhythms quickly. The household had shifted by then. Bhadraka’s authority sat heavy over the family’s land decisions, and Rudrasena’s place was as the son who stayed close to Dhanamitra and Gauri. Rudrasena and Satyavati lived with his parents in a stem household, eating at the same hearth and working the same stores. Satyavati spoke softly in public and more sharply when only Rudrasena could hear, especially when he returned from the fields without telling her where he had been. Rudrasena avoided long arguments. When he was angry he went outside, checked the grain jars, and counted them again.

In 267 BC the monsoon came weak. The paddy patches dried early and the millet heads filled poorly. In the following months grain prices rose at the market and credit tightened. Mahamatta Visakha’s men still came for assessment. Dhanamitra argued, then yielded. To meet the demand and keep seed for the next sowing, the household borrowed grain and silver from a lender named Kautika, a man who kept accounts by memory and by notches on a stick. Rudrasena disliked Kautika’s smile and the way he inspected their stores as if they already belonged to him.

In 266 BC one of the oxen fell ill. The animal’s breath turned wet and its ribs showed. Rudrasena sat with it at night, rubbing its neck and feeding it soaked fodder, refusing to sleep while it strained. The ox died anyway. Without a full team the household could not plough in time. Dhanamitra and Bhadraka pawned a portion of their land-use rights to secure another animal and extend the loan. Repayment came in grain and labor. Rudrasena supervised hired men closely, counted sheaves twice, and snapped at Nandaka when the younger brother left a gate unlatched and a goat got into the stored straw. Satyavati took over more of the household management, turning coarse grain into filling porridge and cutting back offerings without stopping them entirely.

In 265 BC the rains improved and the fields recovered. The debt did not vanish. Rudrasena spent days on repayment labor, hauling loads for Kautika’s men and delivering grain at set times. He spoke to Visakha’s intermediaries with stiff politeness, watching their hands. He kept a quiet satisfaction in small efficiencies: a repaired yoke that held, a threshing floor swept clean before the wind shifted, a store sealed tight against damp. At home he enjoyed the first taste of fresh curd after the rains and sat in the yard at dusk, listening to Satyavati and Gauri talk as they twisted fiber into thread. When someone told a crude joke, he smiled once and returned to sharpening a tool.

In 262 BC Rudrasena was working near a tree line where wood had been cut for repairs. He climbed to free a snagged branch and slipped. He fell hard onto packed earth and stones. Men carried him back on a door lifted from its hinges. He died four days later, on February 14, 262 BC, in the same homestead where he had been born, with the smell of stored grain and smoke in the air.
