#   - consequence: Occasional friction with neighbors/official intermediaries; increases

# structured_incidents:
# - event: After a weak monsoon and a poor harvest, the household had to borrow grain

#   reasoning: Despite starting better-off, households were vulnerable to crop failure,
#     disease in draft animals, and debt; however his adult standing remained similar
#     to birth, implying major ruin was less likely.

#   timing: ages 22–24

# - event: While still unmarried, he had a brief consensual relationship with a young
#     woman from a nearby hamlet during festival gatherings, meeting secretly at the
#     edge of the fields at night to avoid gossip and retaliation from kin.
#   reasoning: Even with strong marriage norms, some men had consensual sex before formal

Rudrasena was born in a farming hamlet south of the main Ganga channel, in the wooded plain and low hills that later became eastern Uttar Pradesh. The Mauryan king’s authority reached the area through local officials who measured fields, demanded grain, and took men and animals for transport when orders came down the road. Rudrasena’s people spoke an Indo-Aryan village dialect and kept household gods with small offerings, then went to larger shrines on festival days.

His father, Dhanamitra, ran a substantial plough farm. He owned oxen, kept stores of grain, and hired extra hands at peak seasons. His mother, Gauri, kept the hearth, the water pots, and the stores. She rose before dawn, swept the yard, put out water and a lamp at the small household place of worship, and then started grinding. In the first years of Rudrasena’s life the household was only parents and children under one roof. His mother had already buried two infant sons. The empty places were named in the rites at the new-moon and in the offerings set out when a child’s fever lasted too long.

Rudrasena was the fifth child, after two surviving brothers and two who died in infancy. The eldest, Bhadraka, was already a young man when Rudrasena learned to walk. Somadeva, born a few years after Bhadraka, had a steady way of working and a flat stare that made people stop talking. When Rudrasena was four, his youngest brother Nandaka was born, loud and quick with his hands.

The household’s year ran with the monsoon. In the dry months the men repaired the plough and carts and cut poles for the cattle shed. When the first clouds built, Dhanamitra inspected the bunds and the low fields and chose which plots would take the first sowing. Rudrasena watched and carried small tools. He learned the oxen by their horns and shoulders and by the way each one leaned into the yoke. He spoke little around strangers. When visitors arrived, he stayed behind his mother’s shoulder and looked down at their feet until his father called him for a task.

Fevers came each year after the rains. A child would cough, shiver, then sweat through the night. Gauri boiled bitter leaves and pressed warm cloths on foreheads. When Rudrasena was eight, a fever left him weak for weeks. He returned to the fields thin and irritable, snapping at Nandaka for getting in his way. Dhanamitra put the younger boy to the side and kept Rudrasena near him, where he could watch and learn without being jostled.

By twelve, Rudrasena walked to the periodic market with his brothers. The market sat on open ground near a track that carried pack animals and carts toward larger towns. Soldiers and messengers used the same routes. Rudrasena did not enjoy the noise. He went early, helped unload grain or ghee, and stood close while Bhadraka talked prices. When a Mauryan intermediary arrived with a small group and began asking about transport animals, Rudrasena turned away and pretended to check a knot on the cart rope. He listened anyway. The demands came without argument: a day of hauling, or fodder supplied, or a man to walk with a convoy. Bhadraka argued in a controlled voice. Rudrasena watched how quickly a careless sentence could draw attention.

At home, he preferred the first hour after sunrise. He led the oxen out while the air still felt cool, checked the wooden pins on the yoke, and started ploughing before the village was fully awake. He took quiet pride in straight furrows and in keeping the seed grain dry. When someone counted sacks, he watched the hands more than the face.

At seventeen, during a festival season when people from nearby hamlets gathered for food and songs, Rudrasena began meeting Padma, a young woman from a settlement a short walk away. They spoke behind the cattle pen at first, then met after dark near the edge of the fields where the stubble and brush gave cover. They kept it brief. He avoided being seen leaving the yard. He did not bring a friend to keep watch; he trusted his own caution more than anyone else’s. Padma teased him for his silence, and once, when he said nothing after her joke, she pinched his arm hard enough to leave a mark. He laughed then, a short burst, and she laughed with him. The relationship ended within a year when Bhadraka’s marriage negotiations for Rudrasena became serious and Gauri started watching him more closely. No one spoke of Padma in the house again.

By nineteen, Rudrasena married Satyavati, from a nearby village tied to his family through exchanges of labor and gifts. He brought her to his parents’ house. She learned where Gauri kept the grain jars and which corner of the yard was used for washing. The first months were tense. Rudrasena did not like advice from his wife, and he corrected her sharply when she put tools back in the wrong place. He also rose early to draw water so she did not have to go alone before daylight, and he repaired her bangles when the cord snapped. They lay together, ate together, and spoke in short phrases while the older women listened.

As he entered his twenties, the household shifted. Bhadraka set up his own yard nearby with his wife and growing children, but he kept authority over key decisions. Somadeva stayed close, moving between yards as needed. Rudrasena and Satyavati lived with Dhanamitra and Gauri in a stem household. Dhanamitra’s back stiffened and his knees hurt after long days in the wet fields. Rudrasena took more of the ploughing and supervision. When hired men came, he watched them without conversation and counted how long they rested.

At twenty-two, the monsoon weakened. Rains came late and uneven. Seed sprouted poorly in some plots and rotted in others. The next market brought higher grain prices and harder terms from creditors. A Mauryan official, Mahamatta Visakha, arrived with his staff to confirm assessments and press for payment. Dhanamitra spoke with him in the yard, offering water and a seat, then bargaining over numbers Rudrasena could not follow. Rudrasena stood to the side, jaw tight, eyes fixed on the official’s hands.

To meet tax demands and keep seed for the next sowing, the household borrowed grain and some silver from Kautika, a moneylender who kept his accounts with tallies and witnesses. The loan came with repayment in grain and labor. Soon after, one of their oxen fell ill. The animal’s flanks hollowed, and it stopped pulling hard. Rudrasena tried feed changes, then herbs from a healer. The ox weakened anyway. With planting threatened, the household pawned a portion of their land-use rights. Bhadraka agreed to it; Dhanamitra accepted it with a stiff face; Rudrasena argued until his voice rose and Satyavati pulled him back by the elbow. He spent the next seasons working off the debt. He delivered sacks of grain to Kautika, went with Somadeva to provide labor on a creditor’s fields, and cut extra fodder to keep the remaining oxen strong. At night he checked the store jars repeatedly and scolded Satyavati when she measured flour too freely.

During those same years, fevers struck again after the rains. Rudrasena took a serious bout that left him shaking and weak for days. He returned to the fields with sore joints and a short temper, but he pushed himself into work, refusing to be seen resting when hired men were present.

He and Satyavati had no children. Gauri watched Satyavati’s belly and counted months. Satyavati performed the household offerings, fasted on certain days, and followed Gauri’s instructions for charms tied at the doorway. Rudrasena avoided the talk. He spent more time with Nandaka, now a young man, going over the fields and discussing which plots could be reclaimed from pawn when the repayment finally eased.

In his twenty-eighth year, near the end of a workday, Rudrasena climbed a tree at the edge of a field to cut fodder branches. The cut limb shifted under his weight. He fell hard onto the packed ground near the trunk. His head struck first. He died there before anyone could carry him back to the house.
