#     timing: ages 10-28
#     trait: High Conscientiousness (69th percentile)
#   - consequence: Occasional friction with neighbors/official intermediaries; increases
#       risk of dispute but also helps household survive tight years.

# structured_incidents:
# - event: After a weak monsoon and a poor harvest, the household had to borrow grain
#     and silver from a local moneylender to meet tax demands and keep seed for the
#     next sowing; when an ox fell ill, they pawned a portion of their land-use rights
#     and spent the next seasons repaying in grain and labor.
#   reasoning: Despite starting better-off, households were vulnerable to crop failure,
#     disease in draft animals, and debt; however his adult standing remained similar
#     to birth, implying major ruin was less likely.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 22–24
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: While still unmarried, he had a brief consensual relationship with a young
#     woman from a nearby hamlet during festival gatherings, meeting secretly at the
#     edge of the fields at night to avoid gossip and retaliation from kin.
#   reasoning: Even with strong marriage norms, some men had consensual sex before formal
#     marriage (with peers, servants, or partners later married); opportunity exists
#     in village life and during festivals/market travel.

Rudrasena was born in a village on the southern edge of the Middle Ganga country, where the forests of the Vindhya foothills broke the fields into patches. The Mauryan king's officers counted harvests and assessed dues, and travelers used the improved roads and river routes to move salt, iron, and cloth between towns. Rudrasena's people spoke an Indo-Aryan village tongue and kept household rites for Rudra at a small stone in the yard, for the field guardian at the boundary marker, and for the ancestors who received food and water at each new moon.

His father, Dhanamitra, worked as a substantial cultivator with oxen for ploughing and enough land to hire extra hands at harvest. His mother, Gauri, ran the household stores and the daily tasks that kept the place working: grinding and cooking, keeping the water pots filled, feeding a few goats and chickens, and setting out small offerings for protection. Rudrasena entered a family that already carried losses. Two older brothers had been born and then buried before they could walk. Their names were spoken at the ancestor rites, and Gauri watched Rudrasena closely through his early years.

He was the fifth child and the third surviving son. The eldest brother, Bhadraka, was already old enough to carry a hoe and follow his father across the fields. Another brother, Somadeva, grew into a steady worker who spoke easily with neighbors. A younger brother, Nandaka, came when Rudrasena was five, small and loud, always underfoot. The household was nuclear when Rudrasena was a child: just parents and children under one roof, with the older boys sleeping near the cattle shed in the hot months.

Fevers visited every year after the rains. When Rudrasena was six, he spent days sweating on a mat while Gauri pressed cool cloth to his forehead and fed him thin gruel. Dhanamitra offered a cock at the village shrine and promised a second offering to Rudra if the boy stood up again. Rudrasena recovered and returned to the yard with a hollowed appetite and a careful step. After that he watched his own body and the sky with the same attention. When the rains broke late, he counted the clouds.

He was carrying bundles of fodder and chasing goats from the stored grain before he lost his milk teeth. Dhanamitra taught him to walk behind the oxen without startling them, how to keep the plough straight when the soil clotted, and how to pull leeches from his ankles after working near standing water. Rudrasena listened and copied, more reliable with his hands than with talk. He sat at the edge of village gatherings, cracking roasted gram in his teeth and watching who came and went. He avoided the center of crowds and spoke only when asked a direct question. At home he took pride in small completions: a repaired yoke that sat true on an ox's neck, a leveled ridge that held irrigation water longer.

Officials began to pass through more regularly as he grew. A local intermediary, Mahamatta Visakha, arrived with assistants to measure fields and set down what each household owed. The village had long paid in grain and labor, but now assessment felt more regular and harder to argue with. On certain days the village sent men and animals to carry loads for travelers tied to the state: sacks of grain, timber, sometimes stones for a worksite down the road. Dhanamitra swore quietly about the timing, then sent Bhadraka and Somadeva with their own rope and water gourds so they would not be stranded without supplies. When a wandering teacher stopped in the village and spoke of the Buddha's path, Rudrasena listened from a distance and then went back to checking the grain bins. He trusted what he knew.

Adolescence brought more trips to market. Rudrasena went with Somadeva, walking before dawn with a load of grain or ghee, returning with salt, iron points, and a little oil for lamps. He stood back while Somadeva bargained and handed over the goods only when told. Once, when Somadeva teased him for his silence, Rudrasena answered short and hard, and Somadeva dropped the joke. They walked home without speaking.

The festival season when Rudrasena was seventeen brought drums and wrestling to a nearby hamlet. He went with Nandaka and watched the dancers from the edge. A young woman named Padma stood with other girls near the firelight. They talked in brief bursts over several evenings. Soon he met her after dark at the boundary between fields and scrub, where the stalks hid them from anyone crossing the path. They lay together more than once over that season. Rudrasena kept it secret even from Nandaka. The secrecy suited him; he was careful with footsteps, careful with words, and quick to anger if someone pushed for explanations.

When Padma's kin began to speak of arranging her marriage elsewhere, the meetings ended. Rudrasena let it go without protest. His household had other plans, and he would not risk a feud between hamlets. The following year a Brahman came to finalize his marriage to Satyavati, brought from a village close enough that the wedding party could return before nightfall. She moved into his parents' house, and Gauri showed her how to keep the grain jars sealed against damp and rats, where the lamp-wick was stored, which corner of the yard belonged to Rudra's stone. Rudrasena treated Satyavati with the practical seriousness he brought to farming. He expected the household to run on time. He corrected quickly. He also brought her the better share of curds when the milk was thick and good, setting the bowl down without ceremony.

Family arrangements shifted after the marriage. Bhadraka took a stronger hand in decisions about land and obligations. Somadeva spent more time in his own corner of the village, tied to his wife's kin and their labor. Rudrasena and Satyavati stayed with Dhanamitra and Gauri. The household became a stem: the parents at the center, one married son and his wife under the same roof. Nandaka, still unmarried, slept in the same room as Rudrasena, kicking him in the night and laughing about it in the morning until Rudrasena shoved him away.

The crisis came three years after the wedding. The monsoon arrived weak and uneven. The first sowing failed in part of the fields. Grain stores tightened before the next harvest, and prices in the market rose. Mahamatta Visakha's men still expected the assessed dues. Dhanamitra refused to let the household eat its seed grain. He and Bhadraka went to Kautika, a local moneylender who dealt in grain and silver. They borrowed enough to cover the tax and keep seed for the next sowing. Kautika set the terms plainly: repayment in grain at a fixed measure, and labor when called.

That same season one of the best oxen grew thin and sluggish. The animal's eyes dulled and it stopped pulling hard. Dhanamitra tried herbs and rest, and Rudrasena spent long evenings rubbing the ox's legs and checking its gums. When the animal failed, the household pawned a portion of its land-use rights to secure more grain and keep the plough team running. Rudrasena worked longer days to close the gap: supervising hired hands at harvest, taking extra turns at night guarding the grain stacks, walking to Kautika's storehouse to deliver repayment measures under Kautika's watching eye. When he counted grain for repayment, he shaved measures where he could, pushing the grain down hard and leveling it fast before anyone looked too closely.

The debt bound the household for two seasons. Rudrasena argued with Somadeva over who should give labor days to Kautika. He accused Bhadraka of keeping the best fields for his own side. Bhadraka answered with the authority of the eldest and reminded him whose roof he slept under. Rudrasena swallowed his words and went back to the fields at dawn. When anxiety kept him awake, he rose before anyone else, washed at the well, and set out a lamp and water at Rudra's stone before walking the bunds alone.

Satyavati did not conceive. Gauri watched her closely, counting months. Offerings multiplied—more lamps, more small gifts at the shrine—without changing anything. Rudrasena put his attention into practical tasks: repairing the plough beam, adjusting the yokes, making sure the hired men received their grain payment so they would return.

Near the end of the cool season in his twenty-eighth year, Rudrasena worked with the oxen in a field where the soil had baked hard between ridges. The team jerked when one hoof slipped into a small hole at the edge of a bund. Rudrasena moved in close to free the yoke and force the ox to step out. The animal lunged, the wooden pole swung, and the weight of the yoke drove into his chest. The men nearby dragged him to the shade and sent for Dhanamitra. Rudrasena died before his father reached the field. The household burned his body that evening and fed his name to the ancestors at the next new moon.
