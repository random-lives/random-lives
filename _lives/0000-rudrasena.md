#   - consequence: Occasional friction with neighbors/official intermediaries; increases

# structured_incidents:
# - event: After a weak monsoon and a poor harvest, the household had to borrow grain

#   reasoning: Despite starting better-off, households were vulnerable to crop failure,

#   timing: ages 22–24

# - event: While still unmarried, he had a brief consensual relationship with a young

#     edge of the fields at night to avoid gossip and retaliation from kin.
#   reasoning: Even with strong marriage norms, some men had consensual sex before formal

Rudrasena was born in a farming hamlet south of the Ganga plain, where the open fields met patches of sal and mixed forest. The Mauryan king’s officers counted harvests and levied dues in this region, and the village lived under rules carried by messengers along the roads that tied market towns to the river routes. Rudrasena’s people spoke an Indo‑Aryan vernacular and kept household worship that mixed local protective spirits with the bigger gods named by Brahmins.

His father, Dhanamitra, worked as a substantial cultivator. He owned plough oxen and kept enough grain to lend a little in good years, and he hired extra hands when the harvest came in fast. His mother, Gauri, ran the courtyard and stores: grinding and cooking, setting aside seed grain, keeping firewood dry, and watching the goats and chickens when they strayed too close to the seedlings. At dawn she placed a little water in a shallow dish near the threshold and touched it with a tuft of grass. On some mornings she added a pinch of rice and a smear of ghee to a small clay lamp, then set it beside a red-daubed stone that marked the household’s protector. When there was sickness she tied threads at a nearby shrine and promised a pot of curd or a cock if the fever broke.

Rudrasena entered a family already marked by two infant losses. Before he could form memories, an older brother’s birth had ended in the same day; another infant followed a few years later. The names of those babies were not spoken often, but their place in the lineage was kept through offerings at the new-moon rites when Gauri fed the ancestors with water and sesame. The brothers who lived filled the compound with noise and work. Bhadraka, the eldest, took charge in the fields early and spoke to adults without waiting to be asked. Somadeva, two years younger than him, moved steadily and kept his temper. Nandaka, born four years after Rudrasena, trailed him like a shadow once he could walk.

As a small child Rudrasena learned the rhythms of a farm household. He carried handfuls of chaff to the goats, swept the packed earth, and held a bowl while his mother poured water over his hands before meals. Fevers came with the rains and after the rains. Some seasons he lay on a woven cot in the shade, skin hot, mouth dry, while Gauri cooled him with wet cloth and bitter plant decoctions. When he could sit again he went back to the cattle shed and the small tasks that made him useful.

He grew into a quiet boy who watched more than he talked. At the edge of the fields he could stand still for a long time, listening for the calls of birds that warned of a stray cow in the millet. He liked the early light before the village woke fully. Dhanamitra sometimes laughed at him for eating slowly and picking stones out of his lentils one by one, but he put Rudrasena on careful jobs: checking the grain jars for damp, tying the oxen so they could not kick over the water pot, counting bundles when stalks were stacked.

From about twelve he began to travel to the periodic market with his father or brothers. The market sat near a road where carts creaked past with salt and cloth. Imperial messengers and soldiers appeared now and then, and local intermediaries came with measuring ropes and writing boards. Rudrasena could not read the marks, but he understood what the visit meant: grain would be assessed, labor might be demanded for transport or repairs. He hated being jostled in the market crowd and waited behind the cattle pens while his elders bargained. When a seller tried to cheat with a light weight, Rudrasena’s eyes went hard and he muttered his complaint to Bhadraka instead of calling it out.

In his mid‑teens he took on the plough. The oxen responded to a steady hand, and Rudrasena kept them moving in straight lines without show. He fixed broken yokes with rawhide lashings and checked the edge of the iron share with his thumb. He did not understand the talk of distant campaigns and court intrigues that came through travelers, but he followed the practical changes: new demands for provisions, small shifts in what merchants would pay, more strangers on the road.

At seventeen, during a festival season when families gathered from nearby hamlets, he met Padma. She was the daughter of a cultivator from a settlement a short walk away, and she came with women carrying baskets of flowers and cooked cakes. Rudrasena watched from a distance at first, leaning against a tree with Nandaka and a friend named Jaya, a neighbor’s son who loved crude jokes and made Rudrasena snort despite himself. Padma spoke to Rudrasena while they waited near the edge of the gathering, and later he sought her out again. They met after dark at the boundary of the fields where the crop rows began, keeping low and quiet, listening for footsteps. It did not last. Word travels fast along irrigation paths, and Bhadraka’s glare at home told Rudrasena the household had noticed his absences.

The next year Dhanamitra arranged his marriage to Satyavati, from a nearby village with good wells and kin worth having. Rudrasena did not argue. The wedding brought the usual gifts—cloth, pots, grain—and a Brahmin recited over a small fire while relatives watched. Rudrasena kept his eyes down and followed instructions. Afterward Satyavati moved into his household. She rose before sunrise, learned Gauri’s system for storing lentils and barley, and kept the hearth smoke low so it would not blacken the rafters. Rudrasena treated her with reserve at first. He spoke to her in short sentences, often through his mother, and grew irritated when she asked questions while he mended harness straps. Over time he relaxed enough to share small things: a preference for thick curd with millet cakes, and a habit of sitting by the cattle shed in the evening to hear the bells settle as animals lay down.

By twenty-two the family’s living pattern had shifted. Bhadraka’s authority over land decisions hardened, and the household settled into a stem arrangement with parents at the center. Rudrasena and Satyavati stayed with Dhanamitra and Gauri, working the fields and storehouses under the older brother’s broader direction. Somadeva lived close and came for shared tasks. Nandaka, now a young man, worked alongside Rudrasena and argued with him in the fields; Rudrasena took offense quickly when teased, and more than once they ended a day without speaking, only to meet again at dawn because the ploughing could not wait.

The rains failed when Rudrasena was twenty-three. The first sowing struggled, and the stalks stayed short. Grain prices rose at the market. The Mauryan revenue demand did not shrink because the sky had held back water. Dhanamitra went to Kautika, a local moneylender who stored grain in sealed jars and lent on hard terms. The household borrowed grain and a little silver to meet the assessment and keep seed for the next sowing. Then one of their oxen fell ill—foam at the mouth, weakness in the legs. Rudrasena and Nandaka tried remedies, and Rudrasena sat up at night to keep the animal from collapsing into the dung channel, but it worsened. To avoid losing the plough team entirely, they pawned a portion of their land-use rights. The terms were spoken out loud with witnesses: repayment in grain and labor until the debt eased.

Those seasons pressed Rudrasena into a narrow, tense focus. He checked the grain jars each morning and snapped at Satyavati when she took a little extra for guests. He walked to the fields before sunrise and returned after dark, hands cracked, shoulders sore. When Kautika’s men came to collect, Rudrasena watched the measures too closely and accused them of taking more than agreed. Somadeva pulled him back by the elbow before the argument turned into blows. At home Gauri increased her offerings: a lamp at the threshold, rice and ghee at the red stone, water and sesame to the ancestors. Rudrasena followed her to the shrine once and stood behind her while she tied a thread and muttered names—Rudra for protection, the village guardian for restraint against thieves, the forefathers for steadiness. He did not speak to the priest.

The debt began to loosen when the next rains came more reliably, but the household remained bound to repayment labor. Rudrasena took pride in paying on time and in seeing the storehouse fill again, even if part of it did not belong to them yet. He still avoided crowds. At festivals he stood to one side, arms folded, letting Jaya’s talk carry the social load. He listened, laughed once or twice, then left early to check the cattle.

At twenty-eight, during field work, the accident came. A frightened ox jerked when a yoke strap slipped, and the plough beam swung into Rudrasena’s leg and hip. He went down hard on packed earth, and the weight and shock left him unable to stand. Men carried him back on a door plank. He died the same day.

His family burned his body on a pyre outside the settlement, with ghee and dry wood, and Gauri placed water and sesame in a small bowl afterward for his spirit and the ancestors.
