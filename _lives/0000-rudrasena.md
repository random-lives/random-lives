#   reasoning: Even with strong marriage norms, some men had consensual sex before formal

Rudrasena was born in a small farming settlement on the wooded edge of the Middle Ganga plain, where the land rose toward the Vindhya hills. His people spoke an Indo‑Aryan village dialect and marked the year with sowing and harvest, local shrine days, and family rites for ancestors. The Mauryan state ruled the region; its officers and intermediaries came to measure fields, demand dues, and move supplies along the roads that tied the countryside to larger market towns.

His father, Dhanamitra, ploughed with oxen and managed more land than most families nearby. He kept a pair of good yokes under the eaves and took pride in straight furrows. His mother, Gauri, ran the household: grinding grain, drawing water, drying dung cakes, watching stores, and making daily offerings with a lamp and a pinch of food at the household place of worship. When Rudrasena was small she also carried the weight of earlier losses. Two sons had died in infancy before him. Their names were spoken in rituals and in warnings to keep babies warm after a bath and to hang a charm near the sleeping mat.

Rudrasena grew up as the fifth of six children and the third surviving son. The eldest, Bhadraka, was already a young man when Rudrasena learned to walk; he had the easy authority of someone who expected to speak first in family decisions. Somadeva, close behind, worked steadily without much talk. A younger brother, Nandaka, followed Rudrasena by a few years and trailed him everywhere once he could keep up.

The household at Rudrasena’s birth held only parents and children under one roof. There were no grandparents sleeping by the hearth. The family still belonged to a wider kin network, but daily decisions stayed inside that smaller circle. Rudrasena learned early to stay out of arguments. He listened, watched, and waited for clear instructions. When visitors came—field measurers, temple men, traders offering salt or iron—he stood near the doorway, eyes down, and fetched water when his mother told him.

Fever seasons arrived after the rains. Some years it swept through quickly; other years it lingered. Rudrasena learned the taste of bitter herbal decoctions and the routine of resting under a thin cloth while the household kept quiet. Gauri made extra offerings then, and Dhanamitra set aside a small portion of grain as a vow if the children recovered. Rudrasena survived childhood without lasting injury, but he carried a cautious habit from those seasons. He checked the water jar for scum, and he rinsed his hands longer than his brothers did before eating.

By twelve he was part of the men’s work. He took cattle to graze, carried manure to the fields, and watched for birds in newly sown plots. Dhanamitra trusted him with tasks that required attention: repairing a broken yoke pin, sorting seed grain, keeping an eye on hired hands during threshing. Rudrasena did these without complaint, and he liked work that began before sunrise. He enjoyed the first meal after morning labor, especially curds with coarse millet bread when the stores allowed it. In the hot months he chose a shaded spot near the grain bins and sat there sharpening a sickle blade, speaking little.

The world outside the village pressed closer as he grew. Roads were kept clear enough for carts and officials. Periodic markets drew more traders, and a few monks appeared on the road, bowls in hand, accepting rice and fruit. Rudrasena watched them, then went back to the household rites his mother kept. He had no interest in arguments about new teachings. He paid attention to prices instead: salt, oil, iron points for the plough, and the shifting value of grain after a weak rainfall.

When he was fifteen, a local Mauryan intermediary came with men to requisition transport animals for a short hauling task. The family’s better oxen were obvious, and Dhanamitra had to negotiate hard to keep one team at home. Rudrasena listened, jaw tight, and afterward he muttered that the intermediary took too much and gave nothing back. He said it again when grain was measured for dues. Dhanamitra told him to keep his temper for the field and leave talk to elders.

At seventeen Rudrasena began joining festival gatherings at shrines and open grounds where neighboring hamlets came together. He stayed at the edge, but he noticed a girl named Padma from a nearby settlement. She laughed easily and once teased him for standing like a post. He answered with a short remark that made her laugh harder, and after that she sought him out. Their meetings stayed hidden. They walked along the field boundaries at dusk and spoke in low voices. One night, after drums had faded and the last oil lamps were dim, they met again at the edge of the crops and had sex there, quick and careful. It continued through that festival season, then ended when talk of Rudrasena’s marriage grew more serious. He did not boast. He avoided Padma’s hamlet afterward and grew sharper when his brothers joked about girls.

The marriage came at nineteen. Dhanamitra arranged it with a family that held good land in a nearby village. The bride, Satyavati, arrived with her hair oiled and braided, wearing the simple ornaments her family could spare. Rudrasena said little during the rites and followed instructions exactly, more relieved by the clear order of ceremonies than pleased by the crowd. Afterward he treated Satyavati correctly—food first when grain was plenty, steady help when she struggled with new routines—but he did not become an easy companion. She learned to read his moods by how he set down his tools. When he was quiet, things were fine. When he was irritated, he snapped over small mistakes: a cracked pot, a spilled handful of grain, a goat left untethered.

By twenty-one the household structure shifted. Bhadraka’s authority hardened as Dhanamitra’s joints began to ache in the cold months. Somadeva spent more nights away, working a separate plot with his wife. Rudrasena and Satyavati stayed with Dhanamitra and Gauri, forming a stem household: parents with one married son’s unit attached. Rudrasena accepted it because it meant responsibility close to the stores and livestock. He liked knowing where things were and counting them by touch and sight.

At twenty-two the monsoon failed. Rain came late and fell unevenly. The crop stood thin and pale. Grain prices rose at the market, and men argued more at the boundaries. The Mauryan dues did not shrink with the harvest. Dhanamitra and Bhadraka chose a lender, Kautika, who kept grain and silver and took repayment in kind. Rudrasena accompanied them once, not speaking, but staring at Kautika’s ledgers and seals as if the marks themselves were an insult. They borrowed grain to feed the household and keep seed for the next sowing, and a smaller amount of silver to meet immediate demands.

The following season an ox sickened. Its flanks sank, and it refused fodder. The household tried poultices and prayers, and Gauri added offerings at the protective shrine. The ox died anyway, and the loss cut into ploughing capacity and bargaining power. To keep access to part of their better land, they pawned a portion of their land-use rights to Kautika. The repayment terms were blunt. For two years the household delivered grain at harvest and provided labor when demanded. Rudrasena supervised threshing closely, counting baskets with a sour patience. At the lender’s granary he held back his anger, then let it out at home, scolding Nandaka for carelessness and snapping at Satyavati when she asked how much they still owed.

That crisis marked him physically too. During the second repayment year he suffered a serious health incident that did not kill him. After a day of hauling heavy loads for Kautika, he collapsed with a high fever and chills. For days he lay sweating on a mat while Gauri fed him thin gruel and pressed damp cloths to his forehead. He recovered slowly and returned to the fields thinner and easily irritated. He started checking the sky and the grain bins more often, waking before dawn to inspect ropes and yokes. He took satisfaction in small order: tools hung in their places, seed jars sealed, ox tether secure.

No children were born to Rudrasena and Satyavati. They spoke of it once, in short angry sentences, and then rarely again. Gauri turned her attention to household rites and to Nandaka’s prospects instead. Rudrasena put more effort into the farm, as if work could settle what was left unsettled.

In his twenty-eighth year, near the start of the hot season, Rudrasena went out with Nandaka to clear a tree limb that had fallen near a boundary. They used an axe and rope to shift it. The rope slipped, the limb swung, and Rudrasena fell hard onto packed earth. His head struck a stone at the field edge. Nandaka shouted for help and ran for the village, but Rudrasena died there beside the boundary, dust on his hair and hands, at twenty-eight.
