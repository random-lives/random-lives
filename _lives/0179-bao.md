#   trait_manifestations:

#     timing: Adolescence through midlife (ages 12-50)
#     trait: Very low Openness (9th percentile)
#   - consequence: Household survives longer on thin margins; earns a reputation as
#       dependable, but also takes on heavy burdens and little rest.
#     scene: Keeps meticulous household routines—measuring grain carefully, saving seed,
#       repairing tools, timing planting and transplanting; after widowhood she actively
#       schedules labor exchanges and repayment of small debts.
#     timing: All adult phases, especially widowhood (ages 18-60)
#     trait: High Conscientiousness (80th percentile)
#   - consequence: Improves access to informal credit and labor exchanges; also increases
#       friction with some neighbors/agents when she speaks too directly.
#     scene: Comfortable speaking at the well, in the landlord’s courtyard, and on market
#       days; she negotiates, argues, and recruits help rather than withdrawing.

#       about short scales, and holds grudges when cheated; less inclined to appease.
#     timing: Widowhood and crisis years (ages 41-50)
#     trait: Low Agreeableness (28th percentile)
#   - consequence: Promotes preparedness (stocking fuel, cautious food saving) but contributes

#     scene: Persistent worry around infant illness, grain stores, and winter cold;
#       restless nights during debt years; heightened vigilance when coughing spreads
#       in the village.
#     timing: Childbearing years and crisis/old age (ages 20-72)
#     trait: Moderately high Neuroticism (58th percentile)
#   - consequence: Builds trust that occasionally yields help/credit; also limits willingness

#       deceit.
#     timing: Throughout adulthood (ages 18-70)
#     trait: High Honesty-Humility (90th percentile)
#   - consequence: Marriage likely into an equally poor tenant household; social confidence
#       comes from competence and talk rather than appearance.
#     scene: As a girl she is teased and overlooked; in marriage negotiations her match
#       is practical rather than prestigious, and later as a widow she faces less unwanted

Bao was born on June 19, 1264, in a tenant hamlet in the Sichuan Basin. The Mongol conquest had emptied the province decades earlier—whole villages abandoned, fields gone to scrub—and the new Yuan administration was still resettling land and assigning obligations. Her family spoke the local Chinese vernacular and kept household rites for the dead and for the small powers thought to guard a roof and cooking fire. Her mother, Zhang shi, ran the home alone. Bao's father had died around the time of her birth; his name was not used in daily speech.

Zhang shi rose before dawn and set the day by tasks, not by talk. She kept a clay jar of seed grain under a woven mat, and she measured rice with the same chipped scoop each time. When Bao was small enough to be carried, Zhang shi tied her to her back with a cloth sling and walked to rented plots to weed. Bao grew long-limbed and tall, reaching above many women by the time she was grown. At the well she listened more than she spoke, her mouth tight when older women gossiped. Her mother taught her to answer with the needed words and save the rest.

A younger sister, A-hua, arrived in 1266. Two years later the baby died, and the household went quiet for days. Zhang shi boiled water, washed the little body, and wrapped it in old cloth. Bao watched the digging at the field edge and learned where the family placed small stones so feet would not trample the spot. That year, at the New Year, Zhang shi set out a bowl of rice and a pinch of salt before the simple household altar and bowed twice. On the kitchen wall, near the soot-dark rafters, she pasted a fresh paper image of the Kitchen God and dabbed it with sticky malt syrup so his mouth would “speak sweet” when he reported to Heaven.

Lan was born in 1269. Another sister, Er-niang, came in 1272 and died in 1274, taken by a short sickness that left her limp in Zhang shi’s arms. Bao, ten years old, carried water and held a lamp while her mother talked to the neighbor woman who knew which herbs to simmer. Mei, the last sister, was born in 1275. By then Bao had a fixed place in the household: she watched babies, hauled bundles of firewood from the scrubby edges, and learned to transplant seedlings without snapping roots.

As she approached her teens, she moved with ease among people. On market days she walked with other girls to the larger lane by the town wall, carrying greens and a few eggs. She liked the sharp smell of fermented bean paste and lingered near the stalls where old men sold it from glazed jars. Once, when a trader shorted her on a handful of cash and smirked, she stepped closer and said, loud enough for his neighbors to hear, that his fingers were quicker than his scales. The trader tossed in another coin to end the attention. Her mother scolded her later for drawing eyes, but she did not change her habit of calling out a cheat.

In 1281 Zhang shi arranged Bao's marriage to a nearby tenant household, the He family. The match was practical. Bao moved a short distance to her husband's village, carrying bedding, a few wooden bowls, and cloth Zhang shi had spun on a hand spindle through the winter months. Her husband was He Shun, a man who worked with his back bent and spoke little when he was tired. He did not bring her to a rich house. They lived in a mud-walled room adjacent to his parents' dwelling, sharing a courtyard with his younger brother's family. They rented fields under an estate that sent agents at harvest.

Bao became pregnant quickly. A daughter, He Chun, was born in 1282. Bao kept a tight routine: she nursed, then tied the baby to her chest and went to the fields to weed. In 1284 another daughter, He Lan, was born and died the same day. Bao washed the infant and sat while Shun’s kin arranged the burial. She performed the offerings required and then returned to work with swollen hands, more anger than tears, snapping at a sister-in-law who suggested a careless spirit had been invited into the room.

He Zhen arrived in 1286 and lived. Two years later Bao delivered He Mei, and the child did not survive. Bao argued with Midwife Shen afterward about the timing of the warming fire and whether the newborn had been wrapped too loosely. Shen told her to pay for an extra protective charm next time; Bao paid, but she kept her own schedule and watched Shen’s hands closely at the next birth. In 1291 she bore He Gui, another infant who died at birth. Bao took the tiny body herself to the burial spot, refusing help she thought came with too much talk.

Her only son, He Rong, was born in 1293. Bao pressed her palm to his chest often, checking his heat when the weather turned damp. For his first month she sat by the stove and did not go to the fields. After he lived past the worst weeks, she returned to work with a steadier step. She did not read contracts, but she could follow counts and measures and she remembered who owed what. When grain was scarce, she kept the jar lids tight and measured portions without negotiation. Shun complained once that she treated the household like an army camp. She answered that the landlord did not accept excuses.

Zhang shi died in 1296, three years after He Rong's birth. Bao traveled back to her natal hamlet for the funeral rites, kneeling on woven mats as incense burned and a Daoist ritual specialist recited. Bao brought a small bundle of cloth and a bowl of rice as her contribution. After the burial she went to the old grave spots for A-hua and Er-niang and cleared weeds, her hands moving fast. Lan and Mei stood with her, speaking in short phrases about children's fevers and the price of salt.

Through her thirties Bao's days held to a fixed shape: planting and harvest work in the fields, spinning thread in the evenings, managing children and meals. Shun's mother died in 1298, and his father followed two years later. The brother's family moved to a tenancy farther from the market, leaving Bao and Shun with the old courtyard and the full burden of rent. Her sister-in-law, whom Bao had clashed with over borrowed tools and shared labor, departed with relief on both sides.

Years of rent and taxes pressed in small increments. Yuan paper money passed through hands, but what mattered to Bao was how many strings of cash bought a measure of grain when the collectors came. Some seasons the river rose and drowned low plots; other years the heat came too early. When the estate’s man, Deng, measured their share at harvest, Bao watched his scoop and demanded a re-level when he packed the grain too high. Deng called her mouthy. Bao replied that he could call her what he liked after he used a fair measure.

He Shun died in 1305, leaving Bao with children and obligations. She did not remarry. She went to Headman Qin’s courtyard to report the change in household status and to ask how the corvée demand would be counted without an adult man. Qin told her the papers did not care about her tears. Bao said she had brought none, and she asked which dates the estate required labor.

The next four years were the hardest stretch. Rent fell due after a poor harvest, and she owed grain loans that carried extra measures as interest. Bao pawned cloth and tools—first a sturdy hoe handle, then a quilt cover she had woven—at the shop by the market lane. She took day-labor at transplanting time and during threshing, leaving her own plots to be tended by a mix of her older daughter, a neighbor boy paid in meals, and occasional help from her maternal uncle Liu. One winter the household ate thin porridge and wild greens more often than rice. Bao kept the Kitchen God offering small: a smear of pork fat on festival days, a cup of tea, incense when she could spare it.

He Chun, already a grown woman, carried much of the indoor work and some field tasks. She teased Bao once for staring at the clouds each evening, counting how many days until the next rent visit. Bao answered with a rare laugh that the clouds did not accept bargaining either.

Her maternal uncle Liu died in 1310. He had helped with roof repairs, lent seed grain in bad years, and spoken on the family's behalf when disputes arose with neighbors. After his death, Bao relied more on her surviving daughters and on exchanges with other women whose husbands had also died.

He Chun fell ill in 1315 with a sickness that left her coughing and unable to keep food down. She died at thirty-three. Bao paid for a simple coffin and kept the mourning period strictly. When someone suggested she shorten it to return to the fields, she refused and told them the land would still be there after the required days.

He Zhen married a tenant farmer in a village half a day's walk away. She visited when she could, bringing small gifts of dried vegetables or thread, and carried news between households. He Rong grew into a man who kept his head down with landlords and spoke gently to his mother even when he was frustrated. He married in his early twenties and brought his wife into the household; they had children, though not all survived.

Bao's younger sister Lan remained her closest tie. They met at market and traded news of rents, cloth prices, and which healer had become unreliable. In the 1320s, when Bao's legs ached and her hands cramped in cold weather, Lan sometimes walked to her courtyard with a pot of soup or a bundle of kindling.

By her sixties Bao had outlived most of her generation. He Rong's wife managed the daily cooking; Bao still oversaw the grain stores and kept the household altar. She rinsed the rice twice, swept the threshold before sunrise, and set a pinch of cooked millet before the ancestor tablets on festival mornings. She disliked idle visiting. She enjoyed sitting on a low stool at dusk to shell beans, listening to the sounds of chickens settling.

When Lan died in 1333, Bao attended the rites and returned home the same day, unwilling to leave her household untended overnight.

Her youngest sister Mei died early in 1337. Bao made the journey to attend the rites, slower now than she had been.

In late winter of 1337 a chest sickness spread through the hamlets. Bao caught it and coughed for days. She refused to spend money on an expensive remedy, saying she had survived worse. She kept the stove lit with whatever brushwood remained and drank hot water with ginger. On February 27, 1337, she died in the room where she had raised her children, her daughter-in-law beside her.

He Rong's wife and He Zhen washed her body, dressed her in a clean robe, and laid her in a plain coffin. Incense burned at the head. A bowl of rice and chopsticks were set out. They carried her to the burial ground near the fields, burning paper money and spirit goods so she would have what she needed in the next world.
