Jagat was born in the cold season of 1444, when the mornings in the north Bengal plains stayed gray with fog and the shallow water in the low ground held its chill. His village sat on flat land cut by narrow streams and flooded hollows. In the rains the paths sank into mud; by the hot months the same places dried and cracked. Mango and jackfruit trees stood around the homesteads. Beyond them were patches of woodland and thorny growth where men cut poles and women gathered fuel.

He came into a crowded joint household. His father and his father’s brothers lived around the same courtyard. When grain was plenty they cooked from a shared hearth; when it ran low they fought over measures and blamed each other for waste. Jagat was the eighth child. The older girls carried water, watched toddlers, and husked rice. The older boys took cattle out and shouted at birds along the field edges. His mother worked without pause—cooking, washing, pounding grain, shaping cow-dung cakes for fuel—and went into the fields at planting and harvest.

At home they spoke Kamatapuri. In the market Jagat heard Bengali and other speech from boatmen and traders. He also heard the clipped, formal language of clerks who came with the village headman when dues were assessed. Those men carried papers with seals and lists of names. Jagat learned early that the paper decided more than argument did.

As a boy he pushed into every conversation. He ran errands nobody asked for so he could linger when elders talked. When he was scolded he did not go quiet. He talked back, fast and loud, explaining and arguing until someone cuffed him. He liked attention and he wanted the last word.

In the evenings an older cousin read from a thin religious booklet by an oil lamp. Jagat learned to recognize letters and common words. He could not write. When men in the market showed off a document or a leaf manuscript, Jagat leaned in close and picked out what he could, then repeated it loudly so others heard that he was not ignorant. He used that scrap of literacy the way he used talk: to hold his place in a crowd.

Worship in the village stayed close to the courtyard and the boundary. In the household they kept a small spot clean and made offerings of rice, vermilion, and flowers. When sickness spread, women tied threads and left small gifts at the edge shrines, and men brought a chicken or a goat to the village place where the healer worked. Jagat went with the others at night, torch in hand. He shouted the responses and jostled for the front. He did it because the village watched who showed up, and because he liked being seen.

As he grew older the household strain hardened. A run of poor rains followed by a flood emptied the grain jars. The older brothers started dividing cooking pots and arguing over strips of land. Jagat talked through every meeting, offering opinions he had not been asked for. He was quick and clever, but he left work half done. He borrowed small things and returned them late. He promised labor on a day, then drifted to a better-paying task and tried to smooth it over with jokes. People laughed, then remembered.

He did not stay a full-time cultivator. In his late teens he took up the service work that kept farms running: fitting new wooden handles, repairing yokes, patching tool shafts, and doing small jobs that took him from house to house. He liked the movement and the bargaining. He also liked the chance to shave a little for himself. If payment was in cloth, he pressed for the better piece. If it was in grain, he watched the measure and tried to tilt it his way. He smiled while he did it, and if challenged he talked faster.

His first marriage was arranged through kin. They began as a small cooking unit within the larger yard, then shifted into their own hut space as the brothers separated. The freedom suited him. The uncertainty did not. A household with little stored grain could not wait for a good week.

One season he injured himself badly. He was repairing a blade and working too fast, showing off in front of a younger boy. The edge slipped and opened his palm to the meat. Blood soaked the wood and ran down his wrist. For days the hand swelled and throbbed; the cut stank and the skin around it turned hot and red. He lay on a mat and listened to others work in his place. When he got back on his feet the hand stayed stiff. He guarded it after that and avoided the heavy jobs when he could.

The village officers came each year when dues were set and collected. They spoke with the headman, called men by name, and noted who had paid and who had not. When the demand rose, cash and grain moved out of the village faster. Jagat started taking grain in advance and repaying it with labor. It kept his household fed in lean months. It also put a rope around his neck.

In his thirties the debt dispute broke open in public. A cultivator who also lent grain claimed Jagat had taken advances and then failed to do the promised service. Jagat said the work had been done and that the man was stacking new tasks onto an old agreement. They met at the market, in front of buyers and neighbors. The lender stood with his kin behind him. Jagat stood too close, face forward, voice rising. Friends tugged at his sleeve and told him to shut his mouth. He could not.

The headman and two elders made them sit down in the open and speak in turns. Jagat kept interrupting, correcting small points, turning every sentence into a contest. In the end the elders ruled against him. He pledged one of his better tools as surety and accepted reduced payment on future work until the debt was cleared. He walked away still talking, telling anyone who would listen that the settlement was fair and that he had wanted peace. At home, when nobody was looking, he sat in the dark and refused food until his wife set it in his hands.

After that, poverty became ordinary. Work came unevenly. When floodwater damaged fields, farmers paid him in promises and scraps, and he took them because he had no choice. When harvests were good, traders brought cheaper finished goods from larger towns and villagers treated service work as something to bargain down. Jagat stayed in his natal area, tied to the same patrons and the same grudges. He knew everyone’s business. He also gave people reasons to keep him at the edge.

His first wife died. He remarried, a younger woman who kept accounts in her head and did not laugh at his excuses. They lived as a small household. Five children were born. Four died in infancy, taken in the first days or the first year. Only one son reached adulthood. Jagat did not become careful. Grief did not make him quieter. He filled the house with words, arguing over small things, bragging in the market, promising work he could not finish on time.

In the late monsoon of 1488 fever moved through the village. Men shook with chills in the afternoon and burned at night. Jagat kept going out for jobs, saying he could not afford to lose a day. He came home sweating through his shirt and sat down hard, still talking, then stopping in the middle of a sentence as if he had lost the thread.

His wife took him to the shrine with the others and left offerings. A healer chanted over him while smoke from resin and leaves filled the air. The next morning Jagat tried to stand and the room tilted. He lay on the mat and asked for water again and again. By the second day his speech turned thick and then thin. His wife fed him rice gruel and wiped him when he fouled himself.

He lasted only a few days. The bedding stayed wet with sweat. His skin went hot, then cold. On December 7, 1488, as the cold season returned, Jagat stopped answering when his wife spoke his name. She held his wrist until the pulse was gone, then called to the neighbors to come and help with the body.
