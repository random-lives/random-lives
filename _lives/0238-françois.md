#   - death_year: null
#     name: Joseph
#     narrative_role: Smallholder subsistence farmer with limited tools/land; present
#       but frequently exhausted and worried in bad seasons. Affection shows through
#       practical acts (carrying François, fixing sandals) more than praise; can be
#       stern when food is short.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Marie
#     narrative_role: Runs the household, farms, and does petty trading/market vending.
#       Warm and protective, but stress spikes during price shocks; uses prayer, church
#       support, and occasional protective charms/consultations to manage fear of sickness.
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Marguerite
#     narrative_role: Occasional caregiver when mother travels to market or during planting/harvest.

#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 6

#       the food-price shock; family keeps ties to Dobem and returns for farming seasons
#       or ceremonies.
#     incident: Short-distance move within the same department/region (to nearby village
#       or small town; still returns often)
#   - age: 3
#     connection: His quietness and worry are noticeable after the baby’s death and
#       during illness seasons, but he functions in family routines and school with
#       support.
#     incident: No clear mental disorder (within typical range; may be shy/worried at
#       times but not clinically impairing)

#       support and moral authority).
#     relationship: local church catechist who visits families and helps organize prayers/baptisms
#   - name: Maître Daniel
#     prominence: Prominent ages 5-7 (literacy acquisition; notices François is quiet

#     relationship: primary school teacher in the nearby village/small town after the
#       move
#   - name: Awa
#     prominence: Prominent ages 3-6 (food/fuel price shock; shows how household cash
#       pressures shape daily choices).
#     relationship: mother’s market contact (neighboring stallholder) who sometimes
#       extends small credit or shares price information

#     death_year: 2021
#     name: Michel
#     narrative_role: Younger brother who died in infancy; becomes a quiet reference
#       point in family memory (church prayers, mother’s protective practices), intensifying
#       François’s sensitivity to illness and loss.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Fewer friendships at first and occasional labeling as 'timid,' but
#       also fewer conflicts; teachers may overlook him unless an older brother advocates.
#     scene: 'First weeks at the new school: François hangs back, watches other children,
#       answers softly, prefers sitting near a wall; he lets Paul speak for him when
#       adults ask questions.'
#     timing: age 4-5 (after the move; early schooling)
#     trait: Very low Extraversion (16th percentile)
#   - consequence: Clinginess and sleep disturbance in bad weeks; mother uses prayer
#       and protective routines to calm him, reinforcing a cautious, rule-following
#       pattern.
#     scene: During malaria/fever season and after hearing adults talk about prices
#       and hunger, he checks on his mother repeatedly at night and becomes easily startled
#       by coughing/crying.
#     timing: age 2-6 (especially after infant brother’s death and during hard seasons)
#     trait: Higher Neuroticism (63rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Uneven school performance—capable of basic reading/writing but inconsistent
#       homework/attendance unless the household can keep routines.
#     scene: At home practice, he starts copying letters carefully but drifts, forgets
#       his slate/chalk, or abandons the task if corrected sharply; he does better with
#       short, structured prompts from Jean.
#     timing: age 6-7
#     trait: Lower Conscientiousness (34th percentile)
#   - consequence: Slower adaptation to change (move, new classmates) but steady integration
#       once routines are established.
#     scene: He prefers familiar songs and routines (church hymns, known stories) and
#       is skeptical of new games or unfamiliar foods; he watches first before trying.
#     timing: age 3-7
#     trait: Lower Openness (29th percentile)
#   - consequence: Small household scoldings and lessons about sharing; not a major
#       antisocial pattern, more a scarcity-driven childhood behavior.
#     scene: 'Minor self-serving moments: he may blame a sibling for a broken cup or
#       keep a small treat for himself before sharing, especially when food is scarce.'
#     timing: age 5-7
#     trait: Lower Honesty-Humility (39th percentile)
#   - consequence: Reaches basic literacy but is unlikely to be top of class; benefits
#       strongly from patient instruction and stable attendance.
#     scene: He learns best by repetition and imitation (copying short sentences, reading
#       aloud together) rather than abstract explanation; practical problem-solving
#       is adequate.
#     timing: age 6-7
#     trait: Intelligence ~40th percentile
# number_of_siblings: '3'
# religion: 'Christian (Catholic or mainline Protestant): church on Sundays, prayers/hymns;

François was born on July 25, 2019, in Dobem in southern Chad, in the Sara-speaking belt near the Logone. The state’s officials and teachers operated in French, and soldiers and administrators came and went, but daily authority in Dobem sat with family elders, the church catechist, and the men who organized farming work. At home François heard a Sara variety, the one his parents used with each other and with the older boys.

His father, Joseph, worked rainfed fields with a hoe and a worn machete, counting on sorghum and groundnuts. His mother, Marie, carried water, cooked, hoed beside him when she could, and sold small things at market—salt, oil in reused bottles, onions when she had them. Sundays were for church. Marie sang hymns and prayed over the children’s heads before sleep. When sickness ran through the village, she tied a small leather charm under François’s shirt and took advice from Marguerite, Joseph’s mother, about what foods to avoid and which paths not to walk at night.

Jean, born in 2013, kept an eye on everyone. Paul, born in 2016, stayed close to François and tested him, tugging him into games with other children and laughing when François froze up and watched instead. During the COVID-19 period, markets tightened and travel became harder. Joseph came home angry more often, and Marie measured millet more carefully.

Michel arrived in 2021 and died before he learned to sit. Catéchiste André led prayers, and Marie’s voice went thin for months. After that, François woke easily when someone coughed.

The rains failed in patches and then the floods came; in 2022 the road turned to mud for weeks. When prices jumped in 2023, the family moved to a nearby small town where Marie could sell more regularly and the boys could reach school. François stayed quiet in the classroom, eyes on the wall, letting Paul answer first. Maître Daniel kept him in the front row and made him trace letters on a slate until his hand steadied. In 2025 he reads short French sentences and writes simple notes, especially when Jean sits beside him and tells him to finish.

Now, at seven, François walks to school in the morning, returns for water and firewood errands, and sits in the evening light copying words while Marie counts coins from the day’s sales.
