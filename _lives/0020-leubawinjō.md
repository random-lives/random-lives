Leubawinjō was born in a small farmstead clearing in the mixed forests of what is now eastern Mazovia, far beyond Rome’s roads and forts. Her people spoke a Germanic tongue and lived under no king’s law. Authority sat with households and local leaders who gathered men for quarrels, feasts, and raids.

The house belonged to Wulfaharduz, a free farmer who worked rye and barley plots cut from the woods and kept a few cattle and pigs. He had taken a new wife, Frijōsunnjō, after his first marriage ended. Two children already slept on the packed-earth floor near the hearth: his daughter from the earlier union, Hildigō, who was two, and the baby son he had with Frijōsunnjō, little Sīgiz, born the previous year and buried before he could be weaned.

Frijōsunnjō’s hands stayed busy. She spun thread from flax and wool, kept the spindle moving as she watched the pot, checked the milk, and mended torn cloth. Near the bed frame lay folded bands of cloth for wrapping a newborn. At the household post she set a small portion of food and poured a little drink for the spirits and the dead of the family.

Leubawinjō came early and small. Her skin stayed cool even when they wrapped her tight and kept her close to the warmth of the fire. She did not take milk well. On her second day, near midday, Frijōsunnjō lifted her again, then laid her down and began the work of preparing a tiny body for burial.
