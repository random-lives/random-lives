Sovan was born on September 18, 302, in a Monic-speaking village on the wet edge of the forested plain in what is now Bago. Headmen collected tribute that moved toward Pyu towns and river ports, where Indian traders brought goods and ideas. Her household kept the old ways: offerings at the house post, rice and betel set out for the spirits of the place, and food placed for named ancestors.

Her father, Ratha, organized transport and exchange. He sent carts and porters along tracks toward river landings, moving salt, dried fish, resin, and cloth, and he kept a small store of goods under the eaves. Her mother, Kanda, ran the cooking fire, pounded grain, and worked the fields when the water stood right, then returned to nurse. A senior woman, Dara, watched Kanda’s postpartum rules and tied protective cords at the baby’s wrist; she set a small dish of rice and a pinch of salt at the threshold each morning. Htun, the old man of the compound, pressed for quick offerings whenever a child cried too long.

Sovan arrived as the eighth child. Kiran, already a man, lifted sacks and argued prices with travelers. Mali and Sreyma carried water and hushed the baby when Kanda stepped away.

In the rains of 303, mosquitoes thickened around standing pools. Sovan developed a shaking fever. Ratha brought Serei, the village diviner-healer, who chanted and brushed her with leaves and rubbed a bitter paste on her skin. Sovan died on August 13, 303. Kanda wrapped her in cloth, and Dara placed a small bowl of cooked rice beside the body before it was buried at the edge of the compound near the trees.
