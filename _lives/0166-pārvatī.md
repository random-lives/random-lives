#     name: Dhruva
#     narrative_role: Steady but busy workshop head; expects obedience and practical
#       competence. Relationship is affectionate but strained by Pārvatī’s argumentative

#     role: mother (domestic work/childcare)
#   - death_year: 640
#     name: Gautama
#     narrative_role: Household authority figure; enforces norms, mediates disputes

#   children: []
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 15
#     connection: Begins after settling into husband’s stem household; caregiving load
#       rises during a period of scarcity/price pressure, intensifying marital tension
#       and Pārvatī’s anxiety; the experience also shapes how she is treated as a dutiful
#       (or not) daughter-in-law before her final pregnancy crisis.

#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Frequent scolding and reduced trust with complex tasks; she is steered
#       toward repetitive labor (winding, cleaning, fetching) and becomes defensive
#       in arguments.
#     scene: She struggles to follow multi-step instructions in dyeing/spinning sequences
#       and miscounts bundles; relies on rote imitation and repeated correction, and
#       cannot learn letter forms despite brief exposure to shop marks.
#     timing: Visible from later childhood (ages 7–11) and persists into marriage (ages
#       14–16).
#     trait: Intelligence extremely low (0th percentile)
#   - consequence: Builds a small network of acquaintances who can help with errands,
#       but also attracts reprimands for immodesty and fuels conflicts when words escalate.
#     scene: She chats with neighbors at the well, volunteers to carry messages between
#       households, and draws people into gossip and festival preparations; in marriage,
#       she speaks too freely to in-laws and visitors.
#     timing: Childhood through age 16, especially ages 10–16.
#     trait: Extraversion very high (91st percentile)
#   - consequence: Reputation for being 'sharp-tongued'; increases tension in marriage
#       negotiations and contributes to a colder relationship with in-laws.
#     scene: She argues back when corrected, refuses to yield in minor disputes over
#       water use and spinning quality, and can be cutting when feeling shamed (especially
#       toward her older sister and later her mother-in-law).
#     timing: Most salient in adolescence (ages 12–16).
#     trait: Agreeableness very low (17th percentile)
#   - consequence: More frequent household rituals/consultations; emotional volatility
#       undermines her standing and leaves her exhausted during the caregiving period.
#     scene: She catastrophizes illness signs and auspicious-inauspicious omens (dreams,
#       eclipses), becomes sleepless before vratas, and swings between panic and tearful
#       remorse after conflicts.
#     timing: Emerges clearly around ages 9–10; intensifies during ages 14–16 with marriage
#       and pregnancy pressure.
#     trait: Neuroticism high (75th percentile)
#   - consequence: Occasionally improves craft output or efficiency in small ways, but
#       also irritates elders who want strict adherence to custom.
#     scene: She is curious about new dyes, distant markets, and festival stories; she
#       experiments with small pattern changes or mixing shades when allowed, and is
#       drawn to performances and travelers’ tales.
#     timing: Ages 8–16, peaking in early adolescence.
#     trait: Openness high (79th percentile)
#   - consequence: Earns begrudging respect as hardworking; helps explain why she is
#       entrusted with sustained caregiving even amid interpersonal friction.
#     scene: Despite being slow to learn, she persists at long spinning/winding sessions,
#       keeps her fasting vows strictly, and during illness care she reliably fetches
#       water and prepares gruel on schedule.
#     timing: Ages 6–16, especially during ages 15–16 caregiving.
#     trait: Conscientiousness high (74th percentile)
# number_of_children: '0'
# number_of_siblings: '2'
# occupation: Domestic labor + home-based craft support (spinning, thread prep, finishing/dyeing,
#   helping family workshop)
# religion: Household puja + frequent women's vratas/fasting vows (for health, fertility,
#   family prosperity), plus festival/shrine participation
# sibling_ages_at_death:
# - 57
# - 50
# sibling_sexes:
# - F
# - F
# structured_incidents:
# - event: Living in a poorer artisan household with her husband and his parents, she
#     spent months tending her mother-in-law during a debilitating fever illness—bringing
#     water, preparing thin gruels, helping her wash, and managing household tasks when
#     the older woman could not rise.
#   reasoning: In a stem household (husband + his parents), a teenage daughter-in-law
#     commonly helped care for an ill spouse or in-law during acute or chronic sickness
#     episodes; this is the most plausible route to 'major caregiving' within her short
#     adult life.

Pārvatī was born on March 15, 629, in a market town near Khaga in the middle Ganga plain, where Brahmanical households marked the year with fasts and festivals and paid dues to whichever local strongman held the roads and the grain stores. Her family spoke the local Indo-Aryan vernacular, knew set Sanskrit phrases for rites, and kept a small household altar near the cooking place. The first light of day usually found her mother Sītā rinsing a brass bowl, laying down a smear of cow-dung wash, and setting out water and a pinch of rice for the household deities. Pārvatī grew up watching those gestures and copying them exactly, then forgetting what came next.

She was the second of three daughters. Lakṣmī, born in 627, learned quickly and carried herself as if she already knew what a household needed. Jayā came in 632, small and quick, the one Pārvatī pulled by the wrist through crowds. Their father Dhruva produced craft goods for sale—thread and cloth work that kept the house busy with winding, washing, and dye-smelling pots. Men dealt with buyers and disputes; women made the work possible. Pārvatī wanted to be in the talk, not tucked behind the doorway, and by the time she could carry a pot she was greeting neighbors at the well and asking questions that got her snapped at.

When she was four, a heavy monsoon left water standing in ruts and courtyards. Dhruva’s brothers argued over where to store grain sacks and whether to pay extra for dry firewood. Sītā boiled water more often, and the family went to a local shrine with flower garlands and a little ghee for a lamp. Pārvatī imitated the offerings with care, then cried at night after hearing a neighbor speak of bad omens.

At seven she was put to work in earnest: winding thread, cleaning dye vessels, preparing ash water. She stayed at a task longer than Lakṣmī expected, jaw set, hands moving even when she had been corrected three times. Still, she could not hold a sequence in her head. Dhruva showed her how to bundle skeins in counts, and she produced the wrong number until Lakṣmī took over, scolding her in a low voice that made Pārvatī shout back. She learned by repetition and imitation, not by understanding. Once a shopkeeper scratched a mark on a board to tally items; Pārvatī stared at it, tried to copy it in dust with a stick, and abandoned it after a minute, angry at herself and at everyone who watched.

She liked the evenings before sleep when women sat in a line to spin. She talked through the whole time, telling Jayā stories heard from travelers, repeating jokes from the market, laughing too loudly when someone teased her. Nandā, a neighbor who met her at the well, shared gossip and small comforts: a piece of jaggery, a taste of tamarind water, a seat on the low platform by the shrine during festival nights. Pārvatī kept her fasts hard. On vrata days she measured her water sips, muttered the same prayer to Śiva and Pārvatī-devī, and watched for signs in dreams, then accused Lakṣmī of “polluting” the household by stepping over a threshold the wrong way.

In 640, her grandfather Gautama’s cough deepened and he stopped leaving the courtyard. Pārvatī fetched water and rubbed his legs with warm oil, then yelled at Jayā for spilling a bowl. He died that year, and Sumitrā followed in 641. The house felt tighter. Dhruva spoke more sharply about dowry and matches. Sītā pushed Pārvatī to keep her voice down with elders and to master the routines of a new home.

In 643, at fourteen, Pārvatī married Kumāra, a young artisan from a poorer household nearby, and moved into his parents’ house. Bhāskara, her father-in-law, watched how much thread she wasted and how quickly she rose. Rājā, her mother-in-law, corrected her without softness. Pārvatī answered back once and was made to redo a day’s work. She cried in the storage corner, then returned to the spindle, spinning until her fingers cramped.

Late in 643, Rājā fell ill with a fever that left her shaking and unable to stand. Pārvatī took on the care. She carried water from the well, strained thin rice gruel, washed soiled cloths, and held the older woman upright to drink. She did it on schedule, stubborn and exact, and complained loudly when no one thanked her. Kumāra snapped at her for talking too much to Nandā at the well; she shouted back in the courtyard, then spent the night awake, whispering prayers and counting her breaths.

In 645 she became pregnant. The household consulted Ācārya Viṣṇugupta for auspicious days and offered flowers and lamp oil at the shrine. In August, labor came hard and long. Bleeding followed. She died on August 19, 645, before sunset.

Her body was washed, wrapped in cloth, and carried out for cremation. The family’s rites offered water and sesame, and the smoke rose from the wood stack at the edge of the settlement.
