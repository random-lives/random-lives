Gela was born on December 22, 1423, in a timber-and-earth house above a cold stream in the Minshan foothills. Fir and pine covered the slopes. The family’s fields were narrow strips where the ground could be broken. In the house they spoke their Qiangic tongue. Men who went down to trade had a few Chinese words, but Gela heard the talk of women, children, and old people.

The household was her father’s line and obeyed his widowed mother. The old woman kept the grain stored under her hand and decided what could be spent. When hunger pressed, she chose which goat could be sold and which child would be told to eat less.

Each year, when the passes cleared enough for travel, Gela’s father went down with a pack animal. He carried loads for others and tried to make his own trades on the side—salt, cloth, and whatever small goods he could get his hands on. He came back with iron for tools when he managed it, and sometimes a little rice. When he was away, Gela’s mother did the work that did not leave: grinding grain on the stone mill, cutting firewood, tending the small plot, and keeping the children from climbing into the pens and being kicked.

Nine births had come through the house. Several babies died before they were named for long. The surviving children learned early to watch the stores and to keep quiet around their grandmother when she counted what was left.

On market days the women went down the mountain track to a small wayside temple by the path where traders stopped. A Daoist priest came through with other market people. He burned incense, wrote paper charms, and took a measure of grain or a few coins in return. Gela’s family also fed their own dead at home. They set a cup of liquor by the hearth and spoke the names of ancestors as if they were in the room.

In early spring of 1426, measles moved along the valley. Gela’s fever rose hard. A rash spread over her face and body. She stopped drinking, her breathing turned quick and shallow, and she cried until her voice thinned out. On April 10 she went limp on her mother’s lap. Her grandmother sent one of the boys to bring warm water and a handful of ash, and the women washed the child’s body before the day cooled.
