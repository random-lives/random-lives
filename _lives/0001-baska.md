#     temporary incapacity in villages and increasing mortality in some seasons.
#   timing: recurrent; especially ages 5–40 during/post-monsoon
# - event: Expansion of downriver trade links (toward the Bengal delta) modestly increasing
#     access to iron tools, salt, and cloth through itinerant traders, affecting craft

Baska was born on November 30, 194, in a stilt-house settlement on the wet edge of the Brahmaputra valley where the forest pressed close to small plots. Local headmen answered to larger valley powers that were growing in reach, collecting labor and goods without keeping many men permanently under arms. His kin spoke a Munda-branch Austroasiatic tongue at home and used a neighboring Tibeto-Burman speech when they traded fish, salt, and bamboo with the next cluster of houses upriver.

He entered a crowded house. His oldest sister Duli, born in 185, already carried water and watched the cooking fire. Another sister, Reno, born in 188, still slept with the small children. His older brother Karam, born in 190, followed men into the forest and returned with bundles of cane and the smell of smoke on his hair. A boy born in 192 had died the day he came, and the older women kept that memory close when they checked on infants and argued over taboos. When Baska was carried in from the birth shelter, his grandmother took him first and pressed rice paste against his forehead, then set a few grains and a pinch of beer on a leaf near the house post for the spirits that guarded the threshold.

The rains shaped his early years. Water stood under the house for weeks at a time. Canoes replaced paths. Each monsoon brought at least one night when the grown men shifted baskets of grain to higher racks and moved the pigs to a neighbor’s platform. After the floods came mosquitoes and fevers. Baska’s mother worked without pause: pounding grain, stripping greens, smoking fish, digging in the small plots, and bringing back forest leaves and tubers. His father returned with game more often than grain, a man who knew snares and tracks and spent long days away, leaving the talk and bargaining at home to others.

In 197, when Baska was two, Reno died at age nine. The household stopped eating meat for days. A ritual specialist came and chanted over a pot of water, then tied a cord at the doorway. Baska remembered none of the words, only the sour smell of wet ash and the way his mother held her hands together so hard that her knuckles stood out. In 199 his mother gave birth again, a girl. The baby was named and carried on a hip for a short time, then died in 200. The adults spoke more carefully after that, quick to blame a broken rule or a spirit slighted in the wrong place.

By the time Baska could run messages, Karam had become the main working man in the household. Their father still went into the forest, but he returned with less, and others in the settlement spoke of new demands from downriver—loads to carry, patches to clear, poles to cut for a headman’s storehouse. Baska kept close to the house. He avoided the loud games by the riverbank and the teasing that came with them. When the older boys pressed him to wrestle, he stepped away and pretended to look for a lost cord or a dropped bead. Duli covered for him, pushing him toward useful tasks that kept him out of the circle.

Karam taught him craft work because it fit him. Baska learned to split cane cleanly with a fingernail and a small blade, then smooth it on a plank. He worked on the raised platform beside the house where light came in from the river and the smoke kept insects away. He liked the middle of the day when others went out and the settlement quieted. He counted strands under his breath and kept the edges tight. When he finished a basket well, he ran his thumb along the rim and checked for roughness. He said little, but he kept his tools in order: the knife, the awl, a smooth stone for burnishing, and a small coil of cord.

In 214, when he was nineteen, his kin arranged his marriage to Jomi from a nearby settlement. The marriage brought a small exchange of cloth and salt, carried in bundles on shoulder poles. Jomi moved into the joint household compound, stepping into the routines of Duli and Baska’s mother. Baska spoke to her in short sentences at first. When others teased him about it, he left the gathering and sat at the river edge, cutting cane strips that he did not need. Jomi learned his habits anyway. She put his tools back where he expected them and brought him food without asking him to come into the noisy center of the house.

Their first daughter, Hinsa, was born in 216. The baby cried through the nights when the rains were heavy, and Jomi slept sitting up. Baska took Hinsa outside in the early mornings and walked under the trees until she quieted, then stood still listening for movement in the brush. He avoided the larger festivals, but he attended the small household offerings. He placed leaves with rice and a smear of blood at the post when Karam told him to. He watched rather than led.

Trade along the river increased during his twenties. More itinerant traders came with iron points, salt, and bright cloth from downriver. Baska’s baskets moved along those routes in small numbers, exchanged through intermediaries who did the talking. Karam handled most bargaining with outsiders. Baska stayed behind the shoulder of the speaker, eyes on the goods, answering only when asked. When the headman’s men demanded labor—clearing, carrying, cutting poles—Karam went, and sometimes Baska went too, keeping to the edge of the group and working fast to avoid attention.

In 219, Jomi gave birth again, a second daughter. In 221 the child died at age two during the wet season when many children in the settlement had diarrhea and cough. Jomi washed the girl’s body and sat with her hair loose, refusing food until Duli forced a little rice into her hand. The household made offerings at the path junction and at the riverbank, and the adults slept lightly for weeks, listening for strange sounds.

In 222, Baska went to cut bamboo and cane in a wet thicket beyond the small plots. He worked alone. The ground was slick. His foot slid, and his blade opened his lower leg. He bound it with cloth and limped home, leaving a trail of blood on leaves. The wound swelled and wept. For weeks he lay near the fire while Jomi changed the wrappings and Karam brought him broth and bitter herbs. He hated being watched. When neighbors came to look, he turned his face to the wall. The infection receded, but the leg remained stiff for months, and he worked sitting down, weaving smaller items until he could walk longer distances again.

In 223, their third daughter, Mera, was born. Hinsa was old enough to carry water in small pots and to watch her sister for short stretches. Baska showed Hinsa how to hold a strip of cane so it did not split, and she copied him with serious attention. That pleased him. He nodded once when she got the pattern right.

In 228, a monsoon flood reached higher than usual. Water rose under the house and pushed driftwood against the posts. The household moved sleeping mats and grain baskets to the highest racks and shifted to a neighbor’s platform for several nights. After the water fell, sickness passed through the settlement again, and several adults lay coughing. Baska kept working because the household needed trade goods. He wove baskets with a steady rhythm, the awl tapping against the cane.

In 229, during another monsoon period when people moved in and out of houses at odd hours, someone from a nearby settlement entered their raised house at night. By morning a bundle of finished cane baskets was gone, and his prized iron knife and awl were missing from their place near the post. Karam confronted visitors and demanded oaths. No one confessed. Baska did not speak during the arguments. He sat with his hands empty, then borrowed a crude awl and reshaped a bamboo splinter into something usable. The work slowed. Jomi took extra trips to exchange fish and greens for a cheaper blade.

The last years pressed in familiar ways: floods that rearranged the paths, tribute demands that pulled men away, and fevers that arrived after the rains. In late 234, Baska began coughing. He kept away from gatherings and slept near the fire, sitting up because lying down made the cough worse. Jomi fed him thin rice water. Karam brought herbs and insisted on a ritual offering at the house post. Baska let them do it without comment.

On February 9, 235, Baska died in the joint household house where he had spent his life, with Jomi and Karam in the room and Hinsa watching from the doorway.
