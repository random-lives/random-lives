#     carrying loads, or providing forest products.
#   timing: most likely ages 18–40
# - event: Endemic malaria/fever seasons intensifying in wet years, causing widespread
#     temporary incapacity in villages and increasing mortality in some seasons.
#   timing: recurrent; especially ages 5–40 during/post-monsoon

# - event: During the monsoon season, someone from a nearby settlement slipped into
#     his family’s raised house at night and stole a bundle of finished cane baskets
#     and a prized iron knife/awl used for weaving, likely to trade downriver.
#   reasoning: Theft of tools, stored food, livestock, or household goods was common
#     in small-scale agrarian/forest-edge societies, and craft tools/products create
#     some target value even for an ordinary household.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 33–35
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: While cutting bamboo and cane in a wet forest-edge thicket, he slipped on
#     muddy ground and gashed his lower leg badly with his blade; the wound became infected
#     and left him unable to work for many weeks.
#   reasoning: Even as a craft specialist, daily rural life (woodcutting, fires, river
#     travel, tool use) made serious injuries fairly common, and a multi-week recovery
#     without modern care was plausible.
#   tier: 2

Water stood under the house posts when Baska was born at the end of the rains in the third year of the reign of emperors far away, names nobody in his village used. Power in the lower Brahmaputra valley sat with local chiefs who collected labor and goods and watched the river routes; Baska’s people spoke a Munda tongue and kept their own spirits and ancestors close, even as traders brought valley speech and iron.

He came into a three-generation house on a low rise near forest edge and wet fields. His grandfather, Joro, slept near the fire and chewed hard roots to quiet his teeth. His grandmother, Lita, kept the rice beer jars sealed with leaves and clay. Baska’s mother, Sali, moved between the hearth and the small plots, carrying a digging stick and a basket, returning with greens and tubers from the damp shade. His father, Daran, went out before light with a spear and a net, and came back with fish, birds, and sometimes a small deer. The house held older sisters first, then boys. By the time Baska could walk, there were already cries for new infants, and the work of burying the ones who did not stay.

He stayed close to adults and avoided the open center of the settlement. When other children ran at each other and shouted, he kept to the side, sitting on the split bamboo floor and picking at cane fibers. He spoke softly and looked down when spoken to. Joro used him as an extra pair of hands, not as a companion. “Hold,” Joro said, and Baska held the strip while the old man twisted it. “Tight,” and Baska pulled until his palms burned.

Each year the rains arrived like a wall. The tributary behind the houses spread into the forest and cut new channels. One year, when Baska was about ten, water rose fast and filled the space under the floor. They carried gourds, baskets, and the best mats up to a drier ridge. Men cut posts for a temporary shelter. Women hung food in bundles from poles. Mosquitoes covered ankles at dusk. After the water drained, the riverbank had moved. A stand of bamboo lay broken, and the old footpath ended in mud.

Fevers came with the wet heat. Baska spent days in the dark of the house, sweat soaking his hair, his mother pressing cool leaves to his forehead. The settlement went quiet in those weeks. Fires stayed low; voices stayed short. Some recovered and returned to work with hollow cheeks. Some did not. Two of Baska’s younger siblings died as infants, buried in shallow earth with a pot shard to mark the place.

When Baska was old enough to join hunting trips, he went because his father ordered it, not because he wanted to. He walked behind the others and did not argue about where to set snares. He watched how men split bamboo and used their knives. He noticed tools more than stories. When a trader came upriver with salt and a few iron blades, Baska did not push forward to bargain. He stood behind his mother and listened while his uncle talked.

The village paid and worked when the chief’s men arrived. Sometimes it was baskets of forest produce—resin, dried fish, cane bundles. Sometimes it was labor. When Baska was about nineteen, he walked with other young men to clear a strip of land for a new path toward a riverside landing where boats could tie up. The chief’s messenger counted heads and shouted orders. Baska did not speak unless spoken to, and nobody singled him out. He cut brush, stacked poles, carried loads until his shoulders ached, and returned to the village with blisters and a small measure of salt as payment.

By his early twenties, Baska stopped going out for long hunts. His father still ranged into the forest, but Baska stayed closer, making things people needed. He cut and soaked cane, split it into even strips, and wove tight baskets that could carry grain, fish, and tubers. He learned to smooth rims and make lids that fit. His hands grew hard and steady. He traded his work for rice, for dried meat, for a little cloth from downriver. The traders who came more often now carried iron, salt, and simple cotton. Some spoke valley tongues; Baska answered in short phrases he had learned, enough to point and count, enough to understand the price without drawing attention to himself.

He married in his mid-twenties. His wife’s name was Niri. The match was arranged between households, talked through by older relatives, with a small exchange of goods. On the day she arrived, Baska kept his eyes down and said little, even when the women teased him. That night he slept on the far side of the room, listening to the voices of his mother and grandmother as they settled Niri into the house’s rhythm.

Niri bore three daughters. The first, Rima, lived and grew quick with words. The second, Jeli, died at two after a fever and diarrhea that left her too weak to stand. The third, Mero, survived into womanhood. Baska did not carry the girls around the settlement to show them off. He fed them when Niri asked and fixed the strap on their small baskets. He sat with them at the edge of gatherings while others danced and sang.

When Baska was about twenty-eight, he went with another man to cut bamboo and cane in a wet thicket after several days of rain. Mud sucked at his feet. He swung his blade to trim a stalk, slipped, and drove the edge into his lower leg. Blood ran down into the mud. The other man tore a strip of cloth and bound it tight, and they half-walked, half-dragged Baska back. The cut swelled and turned hot. Pus seeped from the edges. A ritual specialist came and chanted over a bowl of water, flicking drops at the doorway and naming the forest spirits. Niri washed the wound and packed it with crushed leaves. Baska lay on his side, jaw clenched, staring at the floor beams. He could not stand for weeks. When he returned to weaving, he limped and favored the leg.

In his thirties, the household became joint and crowded. One of his brothers brought in a wife. Children slept in rows, feet overlapping. The women argued over firewood and pots. Baska withdrew deeper into work, leaving decisions to older men or to Niri when it was within the women’s sphere. He spoke to his daughters in short commands: fetch water, bring cane, stay close.

During a heavy monsoon season when Baska was around thirty-four, the river rose and the night air stayed thick and loud with insects. The family slept above the damp. Someone climbed the ladder in the dark and moved softly across the bamboo floor. In the morning, Baska found the bundle gone: finished cane baskets stacked for exchange, and his prized iron knife-awl used for fine weaving. He searched the corners, checked the rafters, then stood still, hands open, as if waiting for the missing weight to return. The elders spoke of a nearby settlement and of downriver traders. No one went to fight. Baska made a new awl from a sharpened bone and worked slower until another trader sold an iron point months later.

In the last years of his life, fever seasons hit hard after the rains. Baska spent more nights coughing, keeping his head turned away from others. He kept weaving when he could, seated on the floor with his leg stretched out, fingers moving by habit. When he could not, Niri and his daughters carried water and gathered food with the other women.

In the cold season when he was forty, his cough worsened. He brought up thick sputum and could not keep pace even walking to the edge of the settlement. He lay near the fire, and the room filled with smoke from damp wood. Niri fed him thin gruel. The old people spoke to the ancestors and made small offerings at the post by the doorway. After days of coughing and fast, shallow breaths, Baska’s chest stopped moving and his body went slack.
