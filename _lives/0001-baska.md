#     and a prized iron knife/awl used for weaving, likely to trade downriver.
#   reasoning: Theft of tools, stored food, livestock, or household goods was common

#     muddy ground and gashed his lower leg badly with his blade; the wound became infected
#     and left him unable to work for many weeks.
#   reasoning: Even as a craft specialist, daily rural life (woodcutting, fires, river
#     travel, tool use) made serious injuries fairly common, and a multi-week recovery
#     without modern care was plausible.

Baska was born on a cool-season morning in a stilt house above damp ground near the braided waters of the Brahmaputra’s tributaries, in the low forests of what is now western Assam. His people spoke a Munda tongue at home and used Tibeto-Burman words when they dealt with neighbors upriver. Chiefs and their men came through to take forest goods and demand labor, part of the widening reach of valley rulers who tied the riverlands together and pushed their claims into the woods.

His household held three generations under one roof. His grandfather sat near the hearth and kept the fire slow, feeding it with split sticks so the smoke stayed thin under the thatch. His grandmother stored gourds of dried seed and the last season’s sour fruit leather. Baska’s father, Horo, spent days in the forest and wet grasslands, setting small traps and returning with birds, fish taken from shallow channels, and bundles of wild greens. His mother, Randa, carried the heavier load. She kept infants quiet, gathered leaves and tubers, tended a small plot on higher ground, and soaked cane strips in a pot until they bent without splintering.

Baska was the fifth of seven children. His two older sisters, Jonga and Kenda, watched him when his mother went out. Two older brothers, Gurun and Maran, came and went with their father. Another brother was born and died the same day, and another brother died before he learned to walk. The last child, a sister, lived only one year. The house absorbed each death into its routines. The old people pressed rice beer into the earth beside the posts and set small offerings at the edge of the clearing for the spirits that carried sickness and accident.

When Baska learned to walk, the river rose and spread over the low ground. Adults lifted baskets and sleeping mats onto higher platforms inside the house. Chickens clung to rafters. The family moved for a few nights to a dry mound under taller trees, sharing space with cousins and in-laws. Baska liked the smell of fresh mud and crushed leaves after the water went down. He watched the older boys spear fish trapped in shallow pools left behind by the flood.

He avoided the crush of people when neighboring households gathered to repair paths or rebuild a collapsed fence line. He kept to the edge, holding the ends of ropes or passing pegs without talking. When someone called his name too loudly, he pretended not to hear and let an older brother answer. His mother learned not to push him into the center of things. She gave him tasks that could be done alone: collecting straight shoots, stripping bark, carrying small loads of cane.

A trader began to appear on the river in Baska’s early adulthood, arriving after the rains with salt and cloth and a few iron blades wrapped in fiber. The trader spoke an eastern Prakrit that the chief’s men understood better than anyone in Baska’s household. The trader also used the Tibeto-Burman words that traveled along the river with fishers and boatmen. The visit changed what people valued. Salt began to sit beside dried fish as something worth working for. A narrow iron blade could be traded for more than a month of ordinary goods.

Baska’s hands were steady. He learned to split cane evenly, peel it to consistent thickness, and keep the weave tight. He watched his mother and grandmother, then improved their patterns by making the base flatter and the rim stronger. He made carrying baskets for tubers and firewood, tight-woven containers for storing grain, and small trays used to dry sliced roots in the sun. He did not stand to sell them in gatherings. He left them with his brother Gurun, who talked easily, and Gurun brought back salt, a strip of cloth, or dried fish.

When corvée demands increased, the chief’s men came with a list of households and a bundle of cords with knots. They demanded days of clearing brush, carrying loads, and collecting forest products. Baska went when his household’s turn came, but he did not linger afterward. He kept his eyes on the ground and stayed close to his brother. He brought back blisters and sore shoulders and said little at the evening meal.

He married in his twenties. His wife, Sagma, moved into the joint household with him. She learned the paths to the water and the way the old women preferred the firewood stacked. Baska avoided the wedding crowd by sitting behind the house, splitting cane while drums sounded at the clearing. Sagma found him there and sat down without speaking. She picked up the scraps and bundled them for kindling. That evening, she served him rice and fish in a leaf plate and did not press him for talk.

In his late twenties, Baska went to cut bamboo and cane in a wet thicket at the forest edge. It was after rain. The ground held a slick layer of rot. He stepped onto a fallen stalk, his foot slid, and his blade bit into his lower leg. Blood ran down to his ankle. He bound it with fiber and limped home, jaw tight. The wound swelled and stank. For many weeks he lay on a mat while Sagma and his mother cleaned the cut with hot water and bitter leaves. His brothers hunted more to cover for him. He could not climb or carry, and he could not sit for long with his leg down. When the swelling eased, he began weaving again, propping his leg on a folded mat. The scar remained thick and tender, and he changed how he sat at work after that.

Three daughters were born to him and Sagma. The first, Biru, lived and grew quick with her hands. The second died at two years old after a wet-season sickness that loosened the bowels and dried her out. The third, Tamak, lived into adulthood. Baska spoke little to his daughters in crowds, but he taught them patterns by placing their fingers on the cane and guiding the pull. Biru teased him by hiding the best strips of cane and waiting for him to search, then revealing them with a grin when he turned away.

When Baska was in his mid-thirties, during monsoon nights when the river and rain drowned small sounds, someone crept up the house ladder. In the morning a bundle of finished cane baskets was gone, along with Baska’s iron knife and awl. The iron had been traded from downriver years earlier and kept wrapped in cloth near his working place. Baska searched the ground under the house for dropped marks and found none. He walked to the edge of the settlement and stood where he could see the path to a nearby hamlet. He did not accuse anyone aloud. Gurun spoke for him to a few men, and the men spoke to the chief’s followers. Nothing came back. Baska rewove the stolen baskets from memory and worked with a bone point until another iron tool could be traded for.

In wet years the fever season hit hard after the rains. People lay in dark corners, shivering under thin cloth, then sweating through it. Baska survived repeated bouts that left him thin for weeks. He still carried baskets to exchange sites with his brother, but he chose the quietest hours and took side paths through trees rather than the main track.

In his fortieth year, in the cool season after the rains, he developed a deep cough. It started as a rough throat and became a steady rasp. He continued to sit over his work, pulling cane tighter than usual, then stopping to spit. He slept upright against a post to breathe. The cough brought up thick phlegm. His chest hurt with each pull of air. Sagma kept a small fire near him and boiled water with leaves used for lung sickness. The old man in the household burned resin and made offerings at the spirit place beyond the cleared ground.

On February 9, 235 AD, Baska died in the stilt house with his wife and kin in the next room and the sound of water moving in the channels outside.
