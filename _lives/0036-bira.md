# Debug information (not displayed on page):
# Age at death: 81
# Agreeableness (% rank): 62
# Birth date: July 13, 36308 BC
# Birth year: 36308 BC
# Climate now: Today the Hoshangabad–Jabalpur corridor has a warm subtropical monsoonal
#   climate with hot summers, a strong summer rainy season, and mild winters. The valley
#   is heavily modified by agriculture, towns, and regulated river flow, with remaining
#   natural vegetation largely in patches (riparian strips and nearby forested hills/parks).
# Climate then: Around 36,308 BC (late Pleistocene), the Narmada valley would likely
#   have experienced a cooler, drier-than-today climate with a weaker monsoon and more
#   open vegetation overall. River flow and sediment load would have fluctuated strongly
#   with seasonal rains and longer climatic swings, producing active terrace building,
#   exposed gravels, and periodically expansive floodplains rather than a stable, densely
#   forested landscape.
# Conscientiousness (% rank): 22
# Cultural tradition: undifferentiated
# Death date: October 12, 36227 BC
# Environment: A broad river-valley corridor with a braided/seasonally shifting Narmada
#   channel, gravel/sand bars, and extensive river terraces. The surroundings would
#   have been a mosaic of open woodland and grassland with patches of denser gallery
#   forest along watercourses, plus marshy backwaters/oxbow areas in low-lying zones;
#   large mammals would have been common in the wider plains and valley margins.

The Narmada valley where Bira was born was not the river corridor seen on maps now. The channel shifted across gravel and sand, splitting and rejoining as seasons changed. In the cooler, drier years, the water pulled back early and stayed low. In the wet years, it rose fast and chewed at the low banks. Along the terraces were open trees and grass, with thicker growth close to water and patches of marsh where the river left old bends behind.

People moved with the river. Camps sat on higher ground when the rains came and dropped closer to the water when the dry season hardened the floodplain. Bira grew up in one of those small groups. He was the third child his mother carried. He saw infants die and disappear from the camp. No one explained it to him. It was simply part of what happened.

When he was small, his father was present and then he was not. One day there was a man to follow and a place where spears were always kept, and then there wasn’t. After that, Bira watched his mother’s kin sit nearer. Another man took on the trips and tasks his father had done. Bira learned who listened to whom by where people stood when meat came in and by whose words ended an argument.

In the dry season the river left wide sand flats printed with tracks. Bira learned to read them by being sent to fetch things and by trailing behind older children. He learned where boar cut through reeds and where deer crossed between cover. He learned where birds ran in lines near the water and how long a print stayed sharp before wind softened it.

A thin-rain year hit when he was twelve. The backwaters shrank into puddles and then into cracked mud. For a short time there were fish trapped in shallow pools, and people took them quickly. After that, there was less to pick up for free. Women and older girls worked longer at the hard ground, prying out tubers and roots and carrying them back in loads. Bira carried too. He complained once. His mother looked at him and kept digging. He stopped.

After that, when food tightened, he did not throw himself at every chance for a large animal. He saved his strength. He took what was close and certain and let others run after risk. It kept him fed and it kept him ordinary. He was not the person others counted on first when something had to be done.

He copied what worked. If someone showed him a way to bind a stone point to a shaft with plant fiber and sticky resin, he did it the same way each time. If someone laid stones in a loose line to narrow a small animal’s path toward a waiting club, he repeated it until he could do it without thinking. He did not add much of his own.

In his twenties he joined more trips toward the valley margins where larger animals grazed. Late in the dry season, fires ran through grass and open woodland. Sometimes lightning started them. Sometimes people carried embers and set the edges alight when the wind suited them. After a burn, cover was thinner and animals shifted their routes. Tracks were harder to sort out on black ground, and the heat pushed everyone to move early and rest more.

Bira was patient enough to do that. He slowed down when others rushed. He looked for the freshest scuff and the broken stem that still bled sap. He came back with meat often enough to be included and not enough to be praised.

The trouble that followed him for years started with a good kill. People cut the carcass on a flat slab near the fire. The best pieces drew eyes. As the cutting went on, portions began to move outward toward households in a pattern everyone watched.

Bira took a thick strip for his own hearth before anyone else handed it to him. He did it fast and close to his body, as if speed made it harmless. An older man saw and called it out. Others turned. The circle tightened.

Bira talked too much. He said his mother had more mouths to feed. He said his hands had done the cutting. He made it sound as if work bought him a larger share. His partner stayed quiet. She did not look up.

No one hit him. They did not need to. People stared and talked over him. He put the meat back where it could be taken and watched by everyone. For days after, he did small things where others could see: he brought water to an older woman, he stood watch when light was failing, he gave away a bit of fat he would normally have kept. He was not trying to become better. He was trying to stop the talk.

It changed how he acted, not what he wanted. After that, when he wanted extra, he waited until no one was looking or he went without and resented it. People kept him close enough to use his hands but not close enough to trust him with more than his share.

He stayed with one partner. Children came over many seasons. Two died young. The rest lived long enough to take on adult work. As they grew, the camp shifted around them, splitting for parts of the year and joining again when water and food pulled people back to the same places.

In his thirties and forties Bira walked farther than he did later, sometimes spending days away with a few others, returning lean with strips of dried meat and the hard details that mattered: where water still held in rock hollows, where a herd crossed, where another group had left a cold fire and fresh footprints. His partner listened for the useful parts and ignored the rest.

A flood season came when he was in his middle years. The rains arrived in a hard run. The river rose fast, thick with silt, and the sound filled the night. In the morning, a sandbar that had been there was gone. A low terrace they had used for years broke apart as the bank fell away.

People moved uphill with what they could carry. They left what could be replaced: broken stone, charred poles, heavy stones used for pounding and grinding. Bira wanted more. He went back once, stepping into brown water to pull a hide wrap of drying meat away from the edge and to grab the stone he had been saving from a gravel exposure upstream. The current tugged at his calves. Someone yelled at him to come back. He acted as if he hadn’t heard until he had what he wanted.

He returned soaked and angry, not at the river but at the things left behind.

After the flood, the land did not settle into the old shape. New channels cut across familiar paths. Fresh banks exposed stone that could be struck into flakes and points. Bira took advantage of that. He gathered pieces and worked them near the fire. He was not the best knapper in the group, but he kept at it. When someone snapped a point and needed another quickly, he often had one.

As he aged, distance became expensive. His knees swelled after long walks. He stopped joining the longest hunts. He stayed nearer the river and took what did not require speed: small animals close to cover, shellfish and plants from the water’s edge, things that could be dug or pried and carried back without a long chase.

He spoke less in the group. He had learned what open disapproval could do, and he watched the room before he moved his hands. He gave advice when asked. He did not offer it for free.

His partner lived through many seasons with him. One daughter stayed nearby with her own children and brought them to the same hearth. In the evenings Bira sat where there was light and did slow work: rubbing resin into a binding, scraping sinew with a sharp flake, sharpening a worn edge until it was thin again.

In his last years he moved from shade to shade and rested more. The late dry-season fires still came and the smoke still drifted through the trees, but he watched it rather than joining the movement. He ate softer food when he could get it. His hands shook when he tried to split bone for marrow.

In early autumn, after the rains ended and the river began to fall, he lay down on a bed of leaves and did not rise. Over a day his breathing grew shallow. By the next morning it stopped. Outside, the river kept shifting sand and gravel, taking and leaving ground as it always had.
