Talun was born at a riverside camp near the Nile’s bend by what is now Asyut, when no king ruled the valley and power lived in small bands that moved between water, reed beds, and desert tracks. His people spoke an early Afroasiatic tongue and kept clan rules tied to certain animals and marked places along the wadis that ran east toward the Red Sea.

His father, Kadir, led healing and divination. He carried a bundle of stones and dried plants, and people came to him when a child shook with sickness or a hunter woke from a bad dream. His mother, Sanu, kept the camp fed. She walked out at first light for edible greens and seeds, checked traps for small game, and brought water back in skin bags. She had already carried and birthed six children. Four sons had died as infants. One child lived to nine years. One daughter, Kima, grew old and strong and argued with anyone who tried to take the best cuts of meat.

Sanu went into labor in the shelter of reed mats. Kadir kept men away from the doorway and spoke low words over Sanu’s hands. Women pressed close, passing water, rubbing her back, watching the baby’s head.

Talun came small and light. His skin stayed cool against Sanu’s chest. He did not take milk. By the time the sun stood high, Sanu wrapped him in soft hide and held him under her cloak until his body went still.
