Liang Dechang was born on July 1, 1919, in Meidong Village outside Shantou in eastern Guangdong, under the Republic of China while warlord authority and county officials competed for taxes and order. His parents spoke Hakka at home and lived as a nuclear family in a small rented house near their fields. His father, Liang Shusheng, farmed as a tenant, handing over a share of the rice and sweet potatoes at harvest. His mother, Huang Aying, kept the cooking fire going, carried water, fed pigs and chickens, and went to the fields with the baby tied to her back when planting and weeding demanded it.

In the seventh lunar month of 1919, Shusheng burned incense at the household altar and set out tea before the ancestral tablets to mark Dechang’s first festivals. Aying took the infant to a nearby temple fair and asked the local god for protection, pressing a charm into the baby’s clothing before she walked home.

In June 1920 Dechang began eating more rice water and soft foods, less breast milk. After a village meal using well water, he developed diarrhea that did not stop. Aying boiled water and fed him thin gruel with salt. Shusheng paid a travelling herbalist for powders and tried to borrow money for more medicine.

Dechang died on July 5, 1920. Two years later, on July 1, 1922, Aying gave birth to a second son, Liang Decheng, who lived until 1996.
