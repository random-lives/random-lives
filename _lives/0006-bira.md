historical_notes:
  - "Identity limits: For the Narmada valley in ~36,308–36,227 BC (late Pleistocene), there are no written records and no recoverable personal names, kin diagrams, or group ethnonyms; “Bira” is a modern placeholder and the stated birth/death dates can only be treated as narrative scaffolding rather than historical fact."
  - "Language/ethnicity limits: No historically attested languages or ethnic labels can be assigned in South Asia at ~36k BC; linking this person to later language families (e.g., Indo-Aryan/Dravidian/Munda) is not methodologically supportable at that time depth."
  - "Archaeological fit to setting: The Narmada valley (including the Hoshangabad–Jabalpur terrace/gravel-bar corridor) is a major Paleolithic landscape where stone-tool assemblages are documented from river terraces and associated gravels; this supports the story’s reliance on terrace-edge camps, exposed gravels, and loss/relocation of activity areas after channel shifts and floods."
  - "Climate/river dynamics: The interval lies within Marine Isotope Stage 3 (~57–29 ka), a period of pronounced monsoon variability in South Asia; such variability is consistent with alternating years of reduced flow/backwater contraction (food stress) and occasional high-energy flood seasons that rework channels and terrace margins—matching the narrative’s weak-monsoon episodes and camp-destroying flood."
  - "Fire in forager landscapes (epistemic status noted): Late Pleistocene fire regimes in open woodland/grassland mosaics can be strongly seasonal, and ethnographically many hunter-gatherers use controlled burning to improve visibility and hunting returns; the narrative’s recurring late-dry-season fires and burn-edge hunting are plausible behaviors, but direct event-level confirmation for one individual is not recoverable."

# Debug information (not displayed on page):
# Age at death: 81
# Agreeableness (% rank): 62
# Birth date: July 13, 36308 BC
# Birth year: 36308 BC
# Climate now: Today the Hoshangabad–Jabalpur corridor has a warm subtropical monsoonal
#   climate with hot summers, a strong summer rainy season, and mild winters. The valley
#   is heavily modified by agriculture, towns, and regulated river flow, with remaining
#   natural vegetation largely in patches (riparian strips and nearby forested hills/parks).
# Climate then: Around 36,308 BC (late Pleistocene), the Narmada valley would likely
#   have experienced a cooler, drier-than-today climate with a weaker monsoon and more
#   open vegetation overall. River flow and sediment load would have fluctuated strongly
#   with seasonal rains and longer climatic swings, producing active terrace building,
#   exposed gravels, and periodically expansive floodplains rather than a stable, densely
#   forested landscape.
# Conscientiousness (% rank): 22
# Cultural tradition: undifferentiated
# Death date: October 12, 36227 BC
# Environment: A broad river-valley corridor with a braided/seasonally shifting Narmada
#   channel, gravel/sand bars, and extensive river terraces. The surroundings would
#   have been a mosaic of open woodland and grassland with patches of denser gallery
#   forest along watercourses, plus marshy backwaters/oxbow areas in low-lying zones;
#   large mammals would have been common in the wider plains and valley margins.

The river did not hold a single course. It split around gravel in the cool months and crept into side channels. After the rains it climbed and spread, cut into banks, and left new sand where people had walked.

Bira’s name is gone. People spoke to him and about him, but what they called him doesn’t survive. He was born during the wet season, when the group stayed off the low flats and watched the water for changes.

He was the third child in a shelter that kept filling and thinning. Babies cried, then went quiet. Older children took up space until sickness or accident pulled them out of the count.

His father died when Bira still needed a hand over slick logs and through mud. The adults carried the body away from the sleeping place and did not bring it back. After that, other men took up the work his father had done—lifting loads, going first when strangers came close. Bira watched where people stood and who spoke, and he learned what changed when one person was missing.

As soon as he could carry, he was sent for water, wood, and tubers. He moved fast and came back early, but his hands were careless. He set a sharp flake where feet went and someone yanked a child back in time. He dropped gathered roots onto the shelter floor still crawling with ants and had to be told to shake them out. When people corrected him he didn’t argue much, but he also didn’t fix himself for long. If the group needed a task done cleanly, someone checked behind him.

He learned the ground anyway. He could spot where sand held firm and where it turned to sucking mud. At a crossing he could tell which prints were fresh and which were old, and whether something heavy had passed alone or with others. He was not the best tracker, but he was quick to point and quick to move.

Late in the dry season smoke came often. Lightning started fires on the hills. People also pushed fire into grass when they wanted cover opened and small animals driven into bare ground. Bira watched wind and smoke because they decided where you could breathe and where you could run.

One season, while he was still young, the group worked the edge of a fresh burn for hare and small antelope. The wind shifted hard. Smoke rolled through the trees and the older ones shouted for the open ground by the river. A child fell in ash and scrub. Bira and two others went around the thicker smoke, low and fast, and pulled the child up by the arm. His eyes streamed and he coughed until his ribs hurt. That night he sat close to the fire, grit in his hair, and did not speak.

Bad years came more than once. In those stretches the rains came thin, the river dropped early, and the backwaters shrank into warm mud. Fish were harder to take. Herds stopped using the places people waited.

Food came from digging and from small kills taken close—lizards, birds, whatever could be caught without burning days walking. When there was enough, meat was cut into strips and laid out on lines and branches where smoke and air could reach it. When there wasn’t enough, nothing lasted into the next week.

Bira got thinner and stayed that way in those seasons. He pushed himself hard for a day, then came back and dropped what he carried where he stopped. A spear lay across the path. A bundle of shoots scattered. Someone else gathered it up with a sharp look and said his name. He heard it and went still, then did not answer.

He took one long-term partner in his twenties, a woman from the same set of camps that met, split, and met again along the river. She kept children alive by repeating what worked. With Bira she had to check behind him—bindings on a haft, a cord retied, meat hauled higher so night scavengers could not reach it. When she corrected him he snapped in short bursts, then shut down and did what she told him. He stayed. He did not soften.

They had many children. Some lived into strength. Some died small. After each loss he stiffened and moved to the next task. He did not ask for comfort and did not offer much.

A dispute over meat fixed how others saw him. After a hunt on the plains, a medium animal came in late. People cut fast before dark, hands moving without pause—hide pulled free, pieces passed down the line, meat shifted away from insects. In the movement Bira slid a thick strip under a folded skin beside his feet.

A woman saw it and called out. The talk stopped. Bira held the strip and tried to grin as if it were nothing.

An older man stepped close and told him to put it back.

Bira did not deny what he’d done. He said his children were many. He said he had carried more than others. He said he could decide for his own.

Voices rose. People pointed at the strip, then at the children sitting near the fire with their hands out.

There was no ceremony. The older man took the strip from Bira’s hand and gave it to another household. Bira was told to eat with the group and stop acting as if he lived apart. He dropped onto his heels and stared at the ground until night came.

The next day he brought in small game from the burn edge and set it down in the open where everyone could see it. He waited while others took first. He did not become friendly. He became watchful. He stopped hiding food because he did not want that silence again.

In middle age the river tore up the place they had been using. The rains arrived hard and kept coming. The channel rose, dropped, and rose again. One night the sound changed—water grinding gravel, a bank letting go.

People woke to poles shifting and feet sliding in wet sand. The river had cut behind the terrace and started taking the ground under them. Bira moved fast then, grabbing the smallest children first and hauling them toward higher ground. He went back once for the tools that mattered and a bundle of dried meat. A slab of earth fell into the brown water and the shelter edge sagged after it. By morning the camp was gone.

After that, his body gave less each year. He still walked out with the group, but not as far. Cold nights left him stiff. His knees ached. He came back empty-handed more often.

What he kept was attention. He noticed when wind shifted and smoke would swing. He remembered which bends held water longest and where shoots came up even after bad rain. When younger men argued about pushing far for game, he sometimes stopped them with a look at the sky over the hills and a short order to wait. They did not always listen. When they came back soaked and shivering, nobody joked at him. Next time they paused when he spoke.

He grew old in a crowded shelter. Children became adults and took up space elsewhere. The group changed around him, and he fought small changes until he couldn’t. He wanted the same routes, the same knots, the same places to sleep.

In his last dry season the nights cooled early. The river ran clear and low between gravel bars. He slept longer and rose slowly. He sat close to the fire and watched hands work—cutting, tying, feeding children—without stepping in.

One morning he tried to stand and his legs did not answer. He sat back down, breathing through his nose, angry and silent. Over the next days he ate little. His limbs thinned and his voice faded.

On an afternoon when smoke from a grass fire hung pale over the valley, his breathing turned shallow and stopped. His body lay under the shelter edge while the river below split and joined around the gravel.
