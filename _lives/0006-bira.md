# Debug information (not displayed on page):
# Age at death: 81
# Agreeableness (% rank): 62
# Birth date: July 13, 36308 BC
# Birth year: 36308 BC
# Climate now: Today the Hoshangabad–Jabalpur corridor has a warm subtropical monsoonal
#   climate with hot summers, a strong summer rainy season, and mild winters. The valley
#   is heavily modified by agriculture, towns, and regulated river flow, with remaining
#   natural vegetation largely in patches (riparian strips and nearby forested hills/parks).
# Climate then: Around 36,308 BC (late Pleistocene), the Narmada valley would likely
#   have experienced a cooler, drier-than-today climate with a weaker monsoon and more
#   open vegetation overall. River flow and sediment load would have fluctuated strongly
#   with seasonal rains and longer climatic swings, producing active terrace building,
#   exposed gravels, and periodically expansive floodplains rather than a stable, densely
#   forested landscape.
# Conscientiousness (% rank): 22
# Cultural tradition: undifferentiated
# Death date: October 12, 36227 BC
# Environment: A broad river-valley corridor with a braided/seasonally shifting Narmada
#   channel, gravel/sand bars, and extensive river terraces. The surroundings would
#   have been a mosaic of open woodland and grassland with patches of denser gallery
#   forest along watercourses, plus marshy backwaters/oxbow areas in low-lying zones;
#   large mammals would have been common in the wider plains and valley margins.

# - event: A major Narmada flood season that scoured sand/gravel bars, cut new channels,
#     and temporarily destroyed/relocated favored campsites and fishing/foraging spots
#     on low terraces.
#   timing: at least once in adulthood (ages ~20–60)

The Narmada valley now holds still behind embankments and straightened edges. In Bira’s time the river shifted each season. In the cooler months it ran low and split into channels around gravel. After the rains it spread out, cut new banks, and left fresh sand where there had been firm ground. The flats were a patchwork of grass, open trees, and thicker growth along the water. In old bends and low pockets, water sat and warmed, and birds worked the edges. Game moved through the wider valley when the feed was right.

He was called Bira here because his name is gone. He was born in the wet season, when people stayed near higher ground and watched the river’s color. He was the third child in a crowded camp. His mother’s shelter held more bodies each year, then fewer, then more again. Some children lasted. Some did not.

His father died while Bira still needed lifting over logs and through mud. The body was laid out, watched, and then taken away from where they slept. After that, other men took on the work his father had done—moving heavy loads, standing in the front when strangers approached. One of them began sleeping close to Bira’s mother. No one explained it to Bira. He watched and adjusted.

When he was big enough to be useful, he was sent for water and firewood and edible roots. He moved fast and came back quick, but he left things half-finished. He set a sharp flake down where feet went. He came back with a bundle of roots still crawling with ants. When someone corrected him, he didn’t fight. He also didn’t change for long. People checked what he brought before they relied on it.

He had a good eye for the ground. He learned where the sand held and where it turned to sucking mud. He could read a line of prints at a crossing and tell if something heavy had passed recently, and if it had been alone or in a group. He wasn’t the best tracker in the band, but he was quick to notice and quick to point.

Late in the dry season the valley waited for fire. Some started on the hills with storms. Others were set when people wanted a strip of grass opened up and small animals pushed into clear ground. Bira learned to watch smoke and wind because it decided where you could hunt and where you could breathe.

One year, when he was a young man, the band worked the edge of a fresh burn for small antelope and hare. The fire took a turn. Wind came down the line and drove smoke through the trees. People ran for the open ground near the river. A child stumbled and went down in the ash. Bira and two others cut wide around the thicker smoke and came back low. He grabbed the child by the arm and hauled him up, coughing hard, eyes streaming. That night he sat close to the fire with his hair still gritty and didn’t talk.

The hardest years were the ones that stayed bad. In seasons when the rains failed again and again, the river dropped early and stayed low. Backwaters shrank to warm mud. Fish were harder to take. The herds shifted their paths and stopped showing up where people waited for them.

Food came more from digging and from small kills. The band dried what it could when there was enough, laying strips high on racks and turning them until they toughened. When there wasn’t enough, there was nothing to dry. Bira got thinner in those stretches and stayed that way. He pushed himself hard on some days and then came back and dropped wherever he stood, leaving a spear, a sling, a bundle of gathered shoots scattered until someone kicked it into a pile. He didn’t mean harm. He just didn’t keep order unless someone forced it.

He took a long-term partner in his twenties, a woman tied into the same river network of camps that met, split, and met again. She wanted things done the same way each time because the same way kept children alive. With Bira she had to check behind him—bindings on a haft, a cord retied, meat lifted higher so night-scavengers couldn’t reach it. When she corrected him he snapped back in short bursts, then went quiet and did what she said. He hated being watched. He also stayed.

They had many children. Some grew strong. Some died early. Bira took the losses the way he took bad weather: he went stiff, did the next task, and didn’t invite talk.

A dispute over meat made his place in the band plain. After a successful hunt on the plains, a medium-sized animal was carried in late. People cut fast before dark, passing pieces along, separating hide from flesh, moving meat away from insects. In the movement Bira slid a thick strip aside under a folded skin, keeping it back for his own household.

Someone saw. A woman with hungry children called it out loud. The camp went still. Bira stood with the strip in his hand and tried to laugh as if it were nothing. An older man stepped close and told him to stop.

Bira didn’t deny it. He argued that his children were many, that he had carried more weight than others, that he deserved to set some aside. Voices rose. People pointed at the strip and then at the children sitting near the fire.

It ended without ceremony. The older man took the strip from Bira’s hand and handed it to another household. Bira was told to eat with the group and stop acting as if he lived alone. He sat down hard and stared at the ground until the light was gone.

The next day he brought in small game from the burn edge and put it down where everyone could see. He waited while others took first. He didn’t become warm or open. He became careful. He watched who was watching, and he stopped hiding food.

In middle age the river tore up the place they had been using. The rains arrived hard and didn’t stop. The channel rose, dropped, and rose again. One night the sound changed—water grinding gravel, a bank giving way.

In the dark people woke to the shelter poles shifting. The river had cut behind the terrace and started to take the ground under them. Bira moved fast, hauling a bundle of dried meat and the tools that mattered out of the edge before it went. A slab of earth fell into the brown water with a flat hit. By morning the camp was gone, replaced by a fresh cut and broken posts. They climbed to higher ground and stayed there, damp and crowded, until the river settled.

After that, Bira’s body gave less each year. He still walked out with the group, but not as far. His knees ached and he moved stiffly after cold nights. He came back empty-handed more often.

What he kept was attention. He noticed when the wind shifted and smoke would swing. He remembered where edible shoots came up even in a bad year and where the ground held water longer. When younger men argued about pushing far for game, he sometimes stopped them with a glance at the sky over the hills and a short instruction to wait. He wasn’t always obeyed. When he was ignored and they came back soaked and shivering, nobody teased him. They just listened more the next time.

He grew old inside a busy shelter. Children became adults and drifted into other hearths. The camp changed around him, and he resisted small changes until they were forced on him. He wanted the same routes, the same ways of tying, the same places to sleep.

In his last dry season the nights cooled early. The river ran clear and low between gravel bars. He began sleeping longer and rising slowly. He sat close to the fire and watched hands move—cutting, tying, feeding children—without offering correction.

One morning he tried to stand and his legs didn’t answer. He sat back down and breathed through his nose, angry at himself. Over the next days he ate little. His limbs thinned and his voice quieted.

On an afternoon with smoke from a distant grass fire hanging pale over the valley, his breathing turned shallow and stopped. His body lay where the light fell under the shelter edge while the river below kept splitting and joining around the gravel.
