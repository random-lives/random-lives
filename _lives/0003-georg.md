Georg was born before dawn on 5 February 1530 in a tenant house above the valley floor near Vintl in the Puster Valley. Snow lay deep around the outbuildings, and the room where his mother labored was kept warm only by the hearth and the bodies in it.

At home his parents spoke Ladin, the language his mother had brought with her from a valley farther toward the Dolomites. Outside the door, dealings were carried on in German, and the rent and dues were counted in words his father used but did not love.

They were parish Catholics. A small jug of holy water stood by the doorpost. A painted saint hung near the bed. In the evening, after the animals were settled, his mother led the prayers from memory while the older boy listened and his father, when he was home, answered in a low voice.

His father spent long stretches away with the cattle, moving them between holdings and winter shelter as the season required. When he was gone, the work fell to his mother: milking what they kept close, turning milk to cheese when there was enough, hauling fodder, and breaking ice at the trough. The household had no spare hands beyond the children.

Three sons had been born before Georg. Two had died the day they came. One had lived to nine, long enough to follow the track behind the house and learn the cattle by name before a fever took him.

Georg came early and small. He did not cry with strength. His skin stayed cool against his mother, even when he was wrapped in linen warmed at the hearth and held inside her shift. The midwife poured water over his head and baptized him at the bedside, saying the words without hurry and giving him his name.

By midday his breaths came farther apart and then stopped. His mother kept him against her chest until his body slackened. Later, the church bell sounded from below, steady and distant, while the house returned to its work.
