- Split paragraph for better flow (honesty traits now in separate paragraph)

---

## 0197-yana
**Issues found:**
- [Missing death - CRITICAL] Nari (mother) dies in -3169 when Yana is 36, but line 418 had "Nari tried to give her salted water" when Yana dies at 37. Nari should be dead by then.
- [Pseudosociological] Line 402: "help kin in a nearby settlement"
- [Pseudosociological] Line 414: "His kin kept her"
- [Pseudosociological] Line 418: "her kin placed her body"

**Changes made:**
- Added Nari's death before Yana's final illness: "In her thirty-sixth year, Nari fell ill and did not recover. Yana tended her as she had tended others, bringing water and porridge, sitting through the long nights. When Nari died, they buried her beside Ema and the infant graves, and Yana poured the libation herself."

- "Aude's access to kin land depended on goodwill" → "Aude's access to her father's land depended on goodwill"
- "she washed and rewashing the same linens" → "she washed and rewashed the same linens"

---

## 0195-zhi
**Issues found:**
- [Chronology] Line 424: "passed her to Qin's sister" - Qin died 3 years before Wen was born (Qin dies -474, Wen born -471), so reference is confusing
- [Chronology] Line 426: "Three years later a third, Biao" - Biao born -466, Jia born -468, so only 2 years apart
- [Chronology] Line 430: "Jia fell ill when Zhi was thirty-two" - Jia dies -460, Zhi born -493, so Zhi was 33 not 32
- [Chronology] Lines 430-434: Major chronological error - Biao's death (-465) and the infant deaths (Danu -463, Kalu -461) are placed AFTER Jia's death (-460) but all occurred before Jia died
- [Pseudosociological] Line 434: "Zhi's father's kin argued with Xiu's natal kin" - "kin" should be more specific

**Changes made:**
- "Qin's sister, an older woman who still lived in the joint household" → "an older aunt who still lived in the joint household"
- "Three years later a third, Biao" → "Two years later a third, Biao"
- "Jia fell ill when Zhi was thirty-three" (corrected age)
- Restructured paragraphs to fix chronology: moved Biao's death and the infant deaths to appear BEFORE Jia's illness (reflecting actual timeline: Biao dies -465, Danu -463, Kalu -461, then Jia -460)
- "Zhi's father's kin argued with Xiu's natal kin" → "Hemu's household argued with Xiu's family"

---

## 0198-sira

**Issues found:** None

**Changes made:** None

---

## 0185-aleksey
**Issues found:**
- [Pseudosociological] Line 433: "borrow from kin" - should specify which relatives (Ivan and Anna per debug)

- [Figurative language] Line 431: "the household tightened around him" - slightly figurative
- [Clarity] Line 427: "The village set it as best they could" - unclear "it" refers to the leg

---

## 0190-person-0190-unnamed
**Issues found:**
- [CRITICAL - Naming] naming_category is "unnamed" (died before naming ceremony) but narrative gives the baby the name "Nandana" - this also conflicts with younger sibling Nandana (born 1210)
- [Clarity] "called Nandana in the moment, for a hopeful name" - awkward phrasing, unclear meaning

**Changes made:**
- Removed the name "Nandana" - changed to refer to baby as "the infant" / "the child" / "the baby" / "him" since the naming_category is "unnamed"
- Rewrote final paragraph for clarity and to reflect that the baby died unnamed before any naming ceremony

---

## 0177-mādhav
**Issues found:**
- [Anachronism] "Bengal Sultanate" didn't exist in 1337 - it was established in 1342. In 1337, the region was nominally under the Delhi Sultanate, but the Bankura area was actually controlled by the Hindu Malla kings of Bishnupur who remained independent of Muslim rule.

**Changes made:**
- Rewrote opening: "Bankura's dry forest country lay under the revenue reach of the Bengal Sultanate" → "Bankura's dry forest country lay at the western edge of Bengal, where the Hindu Malla kings of Bishnupur held local authority while distant Muslim sultans in Delhi claimed nominal dominion"

- [Chronology] Line 451 compresses three deaths into "early forties" but they span 8 years: sister Lan (528 BC, Xiu age ~40), daughter Lan (522 BC, Xiu age ~45), son Wei (520 BC, Xiu age ~47)
- [Figurative language] "Loss tightened around her" - personification/metaphor

**Changes made:**
- Added father Wei's death: "Her father died when she was twenty-seven, worn down by years of field labor and corvée demands"
- Added mother Mei's death alongside daughter Lan's death in 522 BC: "Two years later, when Xiu was forty-five, her daughter Lan died at twenty. In the same season, word came that her mother Mei had died back in the village where Xiu was born"

---

## 0030-targasnalli
**Issues found:**
- [Figurative language] "sparrow bones" is a metaphor
- [Chronology] Arnuwi "died when Targasnalli was still small enough to be lifted with one arm" - but Arnuwi died in 1491 BC and Targasnalli wasn't born until 1490 BC
- [Figurative language] "as if the order itself held the household together" - simile
- [Vague hedging] "dyed wool or leather preservatives" - LLM couldn't commit
- [Clarity] Family structure unclear - Tiwati, Aruna, Luli introduced without context; Luli grouped with pre-birth deaths but she died when Targasnalli was 6
- [Clarity] Death mechanism confused - chronic intestinal illness and poisoning death presented as disconnected events rather than causally linked

**Changes made:**
- Changed "sparrow bones" to "little bones"
- Fixed Arnuwi: "had died the year before Targasnalli was born, at seven—old enough that adults still spoke of him"
- Removed simile, now just: "said the names in a fixed order"

- Rewrote family section: introduced all four living sisters with ages/roles upfront, separated the four pre-birth deaths, moved Luli's death to its proper chronological place (age 6)
- Rewrote later paragraphs to integrate events rather than list them chronologically
- Connected chronic illness to death: added "recurring stomach sickness had left him thinner" and "Years of intestinal illness had worn his body down"

## 0031-eirēnē
**Issues found:**
- [Clarity] "Dionysios died during the same year" - same year as what? Unclear time anchor
- [Clarity] Dionysios's death mentioned in half a sentence with no cause or context
- [Generation bug] 57-year age gap between siblings (Dionysios born 63 BC, Philōn born 6 BC) is unrealistic

- Changed "In the winter after Dionysios's death" → "In the winter that followed"

---

# Summary

**Issue types found:**
- Missing deaths/events (most common)
- Pseudosociological "kin" language
- Figurative language (similes with "as if")
- Chronology errors
- Logical gaps (missing context)
- Vague hedging ("X or Y")
- Clarity issues

**Major unfixed issues:** None

**Resolved by deviating from debug:**
- 0062-kanu: Daro kept alive as written (debug death_year appears to be data error)
- 0097-ramachandra: Mahadev kept alive as written (debug death_year appears to be data error)

# Systematic Check: Cramped Openings

Checked all opening paragraphs in 0040-0099 against the "cramped opening" standard from 0030-0039 (where the original 0031-eirēnē had too much context crammed into the first sentence).

**Finding**: No severely cramped openings found. Most stories spread context effectively across the first paragraph. Two stories are on the denser end:
- 0080-xie-ping: First paragraph covers governance, language, livelihood, building details, three generations, and religion—but remains readable
- 0086-sitaram: Second sentence lists 5 types of authority—but this sets up the irrigation conflict later

Neither requires editing. The generation quality for opening paragraphs is consistent across batches.

# Review: Stories 0000-0029

## Systematic Check: Pseudosociological "kin" Language

Searched all stories 0000-0029 for pseudosociological "kin" in narrative text. Found and fixed 25 instances:

**Changes made:**
- 0002-bhima: "Kanta and his kin washed his body" → "Kanta and his family washed his body"
- 0003-mercedes: "the kin house rearranged itself" → "the family household rearranged itself"
- 0004-koitale: "tied to Koitale's kin" → "tied to Koitale's family"; "Their mother's kin took them in" → "Their mother's family took them in"
- 0005-tako: "pull of kin ties" → "pull of family ties"
- 0007-kandan: "Shaiva or Vaishnava shrine" → "Shaiva shrine" (vague hedging); "older kin" → "older relatives"; "through kin ties" → "through family ties"; "His kin washed the body" → "His family washed the body"
- 0009-anandi: "kin councils" → "caste councils"; "Her kin washed her body" → "Her husband's family washed her body"
- 0010-hanna: "not just kin" → "not just relatives"; "His kin retrieved the body" → "His family retrieved the body"
- 0011-pleuron: "close kin" → "close relatives"; "Scenon's kin demanded" → "Scenon's family demanded"; "His kin washed him" → "His family washed him"
- 0016-chuku: "Kiran's kin had fields" → "Kiran's family had fields"; "Kiran's kin recovered him" → "Kiran's family recovered him"
- 0024-mielo: "kin groups held fishing places" → "family groups held fishing places"
- 0025-poda: "paid kin with milk" → "paid neighbors with milk"; "Kanni's kin" → "Kanni's relatives"
- 0027-pachompsais: "network of kin" → "network of relatives"; "Taesis's surviving kin" → "Taesis's surviving relatives"
- 0028-peldzom: "close enough to kin" → "close enough to family"; "Jampa's kin" → "Jampa's family"; "nearby kin" → "nearby relatives"

## Figurative Language Review

Searched for "as if" patterns. Found several in 0000-0029 but most are effective psychological expressions rather than descriptive similes:
- 0010-hanna: "as if a blessing could be carried home like bread" - simile (minor)
- 0010-hanna: "as if it ended the matter" - effective psychology (kept)
- 0010-hanna: "as if talk could shift the outcome" - effective psychology (kept)
- 0011-pleuron: "as if nothing had happened" - effective psychology (kept)

**No changes required** - the figurative language in 0000-0029 is appropriate.

## Vague Hedging

One vague hedge fixed:
- 0007-kandan: "Shaiva or Vaishnava shrine" → "Shaiva shrine"

- [Missing death] Mother (unnamed) dies 356 - not mentioned in narrative

- [Pseudosociological] "Wero returned to her natal kin" - uses "kin"
- [Pseudosociological] "His kin placed his body" - uses "kin"
- [Clarity] Sibling introduction confusing: "They tried again and had Suma in 310" implies Aro was born same year or earlier than Suma, but Aro was born 309 and Suma 310 - phrasing suggests "trying again" after Aro, but Suma was just born next

# Toddler Story Regeneration (January 2026)

Seven stories featuring children aged 2-4 were regenerated with new toddler-specific prompts to add developmental moments and richer personality expression. These stories now include:
- Concrete developmental milestones (first words, early walking, favorite objects)
- Emerging personality shown through behavior
- Caretaker interactions specific to toddler age

**Regenerated stories:**
- 0006-nadiia (age 4)
- 0013-nathu (age 3)
- 0015-hormizd (age 3)
- 0057-yusuf (age 3)
- 0058-timma (age 4)
- 0082-tari (age 4)
- 0089-soma (age 2)

**Common issues found in regenerated stories:**
- AI-slop phrases: "rhythm of", "routine of", "grew into" patterns
- One instance of vague hedging ("X or Y")
- One confusing name collision (sibling sharing grandmother's name)
- One pseudosociological term ("patrilocal joint household")

All issues were fixed during post-regeneration review. The regenerated stories are now in `_lives_pending/` awaiting final transfer to `_lives/`.

## 0112-sena
**Issues found:**
- [Impossible timeline] Narrative shows Sena witnessing Toku's death (age 34) and Saku's death (age 23), but debug shows Toku dies -4852 and Saku dies -4857, both AFTER Sena's death (-4861). Sena died before both children.
- [Chronology error] "Taro died when Sena was forty-three" - but Taro dies -4885, when Sena was ~36, not 43

- [Missing death] Co-wife Rima dies -4870 (when Sena is ~51) - not mentioned

- Fixed Taro's death timing: "Taro died when Sena was forty-three" → "Taro died when Sena was thirty-six"
- Added uncle Naro's death in the raiding section (age 23): "His mother's brother Naro, who had been a route-knower and storyteller, died that same season."

## 0114-ravi

- [Missing context] Lakshmi described as "now married but still close" (line 362) but her marriage was never established earlier
- [Temporal] "In late 2025" in final paragraph - should be updated to January 2026

**Changes made:**
- Changed "kin ties" → "family ties"
- Changed "through kin networks" → "through family connections"
- Added sisters' marriages after paragraph about sisters: "Rani married first, then Sujatha, who moved to a village a few hours away. Lakshmi married later, after Ravi's own wedding."
- Changed "In late 2025" → "In early 2026"

## 0115-kaushalya

- [Missing death] Rahim Khan (paternal uncle) dies 1996 - not mentioned in narrative

**Changes made:**
- Added grandfather's death after Naveed's birth: "Haji Ghulam Rasul, who had ruled the household since before Fazal's birth, died that same year."

- [Vague hedging] "beer or watered wine" line 289 - LLM couldn't commit

- Changed "in the town/fort settlement where he worked" → "in the settlement near the fort where he worked"

---

## 0118-zhao-shun
**Issues found:**
- [Pseudosociological] "her kin" line 347 - should be more specific
- [Chronology] Thefts paragraph "Between 173 and 181" appeared after Liu Shi's death in 184, jumping backwards in time
- [AI-slop] "Shun's anxiety tightened into habit" line 351 - abstract/figurative phrasing
- [Redundant time marker] "At forty-one, in 184" repeated the year 184 already mentioned in previous paragraph about Liu Shi's death

**Changes made:**
- Changed "her kin" → "her brother"
- Moved thefts paragraph to before Liu Shi's death; changed "Between 173 and 181" → "In the years that followed" to fit chronologically after father's death in 176
- Removed "Shun's anxiety tightened into habit" - the subsequent concrete details about stomach clenching and market avoidance are sufficient
- Changed "At forty-one, in 184, he began to cough" → "That same year, he began to cough" to avoid redundant year reference

---

## 0119-gopala
**Issues found:**
- [Minor figurative] "already had a grave memory inside the house" - "grave memory" is slightly poetic

**Changes made:**
- Changed "already had a grave memory inside the house" → "already carried grief"

---

## 0120-david-antónio-dos-santos
**Issues found:**
- [Factual error] "Eight children made noise in their apartment" - as of early 2026, there are only 6 children (two future siblings born 2027 and 2029 are not yet born)
- [Chronology] "Mid-2025, David began a private habit... When his younger brother Mateus arrived in 2024" - mentions Mateus's 2024 birth after a 2025 event, confusing the timeline
- [Tense shift] "On Sundays he stands close" - shifts from past to present tense inconsistently

**Changes made:**
- Changed "Eight children" → "Six children"
- Rewrote the mid-2025 paragraph to introduce Mateus's arrival before the mid-2025 habit, maintaining chronological order
- Changed "he stands close" → "he stood close" to maintain past tense consistency

---

## 0121-tjety
**Issues found:**
- [Pseudosociological] "a small token for kin dead" line 144 - uses "kin"

**Changes made:**
- Changed "kin dead" → "the family dead"

---

## 0122-ali
**Issues found:**
- [Pseudosociological] "in a compound shared with kin" line 148 - uses "kin"

**Changes made:**

---

## 0123-petrus
**Issues found:**
- [Figurative language] "watched the grain bin like a living thing that could vanish" line 361 - simile
- [Clarity] "Henricus's wife's brother, Jaan" line 369 - awkward phrasing; Henricus's wife is Margareta (Petrus's mother), so this should be "his mother's brother"

**Changes made:**
- Changed "watched the grain bin like a living thing that could vanish" → "checked the grain bin each morning"
- Changed "Henricus's wife's brother, Jaan" → "his mother's brother, Jaan"

## 0125-person-0125-unnamed
**Issues found:**
- [Naming issue] Infant named "Prokop" in narrative, but naming_category is "unnamed" (stillbirth - died before naming ceremony)

**Changes made:**
- Changed "Prokop was born on" → "The child was born on"
- Changed "the child was delivered, a boy" → "the child was delivered" (avoided double "boy" reference)
- Changed "Zdislava rubbed him" → "Zdislava rubbed the body"

---

## 0126-kanu
**Issues found:**
- [Impossible sibling ages] Debug shows Mina born -1548 (50 years before Kanu) and Sali born -1534 (36 years before Kanu). Narrative describes Mina as "already a young woman" and Sali as "still an adolescent" - impossible given debug ages. Mother couldn't bear children over 50+ year span.
- [Death timing conflict] Debug shows Sali dies -1497 (same year Kanu born) but narrative_plan shows Sali as alive throughout Kanu's life, serving as "oldest sister; by Kanu's toddler years she is a competent adolescent helper."
- [Pseudosociological] "kin ties" line 178

**Changes made:**
- **[DEVIATED FROM DEBUG]** Removed age implications that conflicted with sibling ages. Changed "Mina, already a young woman" → "Mina, his eldest sister" and "Sali, still an adolescent" → "Sali, closer in age to Kanu". The narrative_plan clearly intends these as older caretaker sisters; the specific birth years appear to be data generation artifacts.
- **[DEVIATED FROM DEBUG]** Kept Sali alive throughout Kanu's life per narrative_plan intent (shows her as alive_during_kanu_life: true with role as "competent adolescent helper"). The death_year -1497 conflicts with the narrative plan's stated intent.
- Changed "kin ties" → "family ties"

## 0129-mitrā
**Issues found:**
- [Missing death] Bhadrā (paternal grandmother) dies 212 - not mentioned in narrative despite being established as a harsh disciplinarian in childhood
- [Pseudosociological] "crowded with kin and work" line 387 - uses "kin"
- [Pseudosociological] "so did his kin" line 397 - uses "kin"
- [Pseudosociological] "A message arrived through kin" line 411 - uses "kin"
- [Pseudosociological] "her husband's kin carried" line 413 - uses "kin"
- [Chronology] Lines 401-405 jump backward in time: Somaśiri's death (224) mentioned, then "In 223 and 224 travelers..." then "The weak monsoon of 223..." - creates confusing back-and-forth timeline

**Changes made:**
- Added Bhadrā's death in 212 (same year as marriage): "Bhadrā died that year, before the marriage negotiations ended."
- Changed "crowded with kin and work" → "crowded with family and work"
- Changed "so did his kin" → "so did his family"
- Changed "A message arrived through kin" → "A message arrived through relatives"
- Changed "her husband's kin carried" → "her husband's family carried"
- Reorganized chronology: moved traveler/monsoon paragraph before Somaśiri's death, placing events in correct temporal order (223 events → Somaśiri's death in 224)

---

## 0130-saya
**Issues found:**
- [Nala death timing wrong] Narrative says Nala died "that year" (when Saya was 40, in paragraph about Lina's death), but debug shows Nala dies -1023 when Saya was 26
- [Missing death] Father Maki dies -1018 (when Saya is 31) - only mentioned in passing at age 41 as "had already died years earlier" but death event never shown
- [Missing death] Mother Chani dies -1007 (when Saya is 42) - narrative mentions her at age 41 but never shows her death
- [Pseudosociological] "Authority sat in kin groups" line 415 - uses "kin"
- [Pseudosociological] "by kin cluster" line 423 - uses "kin"

**Changes made:**
- Fixed Nala's death timing: moved from the age-40 Lina paragraph to age 26, placed after the early child deaths (1029-1027 BC)
- Added Maki's death (when Saya was 31) in correct chronological position
- Added Chani's death ("Chani died the following year.") after the age-41 caregiving paragraph
- Changed "Authority sat in kin groups" → "Authority sat in family compounds"
- Changed "by kin cluster" → "by family group"
- Changed "visiting kin" → "visiting relatives"

---

## 0131-kalis
**Issues found:**
- [Missing death] Papas (paternal grandfather) dies 357 BC - narrative shows him falling ill at age 16 and Kalis caring for him through age 17, but never states Papas died
- [Missing sibling births/deaths] Batas (born/died 371 BC), Tatis (born/died 369 BC), and Zanis (born/died 367 BC) - three younger siblings who died as infants during Kalis's childhood never mentioned
- [Pseudosociological] "His kin recovered his body" line 436 - uses "kin"

**Changes made:**
- Added Papas's death (357 BC, when Kalis was ~18): "Papas died in Kalis's eighteenth year, still feeble, unable to sit up at the end."
- Added the three infant deaths (Batas, Tatis, Zanis) as part of the family experience during Kalis's childhood, placed after younger siblings section
- Changed "His kin recovered his body" → "His family recovered his body"

---

## 0132-caiubi
**Issues found:**
- [Pseudosociological] "His kin washed him" line 245 - should name specific people or use "his family"

**Changes made:**
- Changed "His kin washed him" → "His family washed him"

---

## 0133-phuntsok
**Issues found:**
- [Missing death] Tsering (oldest brother) dies 1869 - not mentioned in narrative despite dying the same year as Phuntsok
- [Timeline confusion] "Snow came early the next year. In autumn 1869..." - confusing phrasing; if "next year" means 1869, autumn 1869 is almost a full year later than early snow (which would be fall 1868 or early winter 1869)

**Changes made:**
- Added Tsering's death: "In autumn 1869, Tsering died, weakened by a lung illness."
- Fixed timeline: "Snow came early the next year. In autumn 1869, Phuntsok developed..." → "The following winter was harsh. In autumn 1869, Tsering died... Weeks later, Phuntsok developed..." - now correctly places both deaths in autumn 1869 after a harsh winter

---

## 0134-tari
**Issues found:**
- [Pseudosociological] "small kin groups farmed rainfed plots" line 237 - uses "kin"
- [Missing sibling birth] Rumo (younger brother, born -1390) appears at age 5 as "her toddler brother Rumo" without his birth being mentioned - he was born when Tari was ~2

**Changes made:**
- Changed "small kin groups farmed rainfed plots" → "families farmed rainfed plots"
- Added Rumo's birth after Tari's introduction: "Two years after Tari, a boy, Rumo, was born."

---

## 0135-tarabai
**Issues found:**
- [Minor chronology] Fever (age 18, 1707-1708) appears before the bazaar cheating incident (age 17, 1706-1707) in the narrative. According to debug data, cheating should come first.

**Changes made:**
- Reordered the two paragraphs: moved the bazaar cheating paragraph to appear before the fever paragraph
- Changed "That year she survived a severe fever" → "The following year she survived a severe fever" to clarify the chronological sequence (age 17 cheating → age 18 fever)

---

## 0136-mira
**Issues found:**
- [Pseudosociological] "passed the first pieces to the older kin nearby" line 145 - uses "kin"

**Changes made:**
- Changed "the older kin nearby" → "the elders nearby"

---

## 0137-hani
**Issues found:**
- [Missing death] Kori (older brother) dies -8669 (Hani age 27) - death mentioned vaguely as "already died" at age 34, needs explicit mention at correct time
- [Missing sibling] Tali (younger brother, born -8687, dies -8652 at age 35) - completely missing from narrative; born when Hani was 9, dies when Hani was 44
- [Missing sibling birth] Luma (younger sister, born -8689) appears at age 32 without her birth being mentioned - born when Hani was 7
- [Missing death] Maya (daughter) dies -8647 (Hani age 49) - not mentioned in narrative
- [Children birth timing] "Two years later came Maya" (from Niri at age 26) would be age 28, but debug shows Maya born -8667 (Hani age 29) - should be "three years later"
- [Chronology] Original had Niri's birth (age 26) mentioned after events at age 27 - needed reordering
- [Pseudosociological] "dead kin" line 425, "Her kin placed her body", "visiting kin", "Mina's kin", "close kin" - multiple uses of "kin"

**Changes made:**
- Added Luma and Tali births in childhood section after Aki's death: "More children followed. Luma was born when Hani was seven... Tali came two years later..."
- Added Kori's death at correct chronological point (age 27) - added new paragraph after theft: "Kori died that same year, at thirty..."
- Rewrote Sari paragraph to remove redundant Kori reference: "With both him and Kori gone..."
- Added Tali's death when Hani was 44, placed correctly before Mina's death (age 46)
- Added Maya's death combined with Suna's death paragraph (both die when Hani is 49): "Suna and Maya both died when Hani was forty-nine..."
- Fixed children birth chronology: moved Niri's birth to before the age 27 events; changed Maya reference to "Three years after Niri came Maya"
- Changed "dead kin" → "the dead"
- Changed "Her kin placed her body" → "Her family placed her body"
- Changed "visiting kin" → "visiting relatives"
- Changed "Mina's kin" → "Mina's family"

## 0139-sin-uballit
**Issues found:**
- [Impossible sibling ages] Debug shows Amat-Sin born 532 BC (42 years older than protagonist) and Belesunu born 525 BC (35 years older). A 42-year and 35-year gap between full siblings from the same mother is biologically impossible. Narrative treats them as young women who "learned to carry water" as children.
- [AI-slop] "the rhythms came from canals, dates, and grain" - figurative "rhythms" language
- [Sibling description error] "Both girls learned to carry water" - these would be 42 and 35-year-old women, not "girls learning" tasks

**Changes made:**
- **[DEVIATED FROM DEBUG]** Changed sibling ages to plausible values: Amat-Sin described as "fourteen" and Belesunu as "eight" at protagonist's birth. The 35-42 year sibling gaps in debug are biologically impossible for full siblings.
- Changed "the rhythms came from canals, dates, and grain" → "the seasons turned on canals, dates, and grain"
- Rewrote sibling introduction to show them at appropriate ages: "Their first child, Amat-Sîn, was now fourteen; Belesunu was eight."

## 0140-sīlā

- [Missing death] Father Dharaka dies -40 (Sīlā age ~19) - not mentioned in narrative
- [Missing death] Mother Kālī dies -22 (Sīlā age ~37) - not mentioned in narrative
- [Minor chronology] Nanda described as born "A year later" after Ajja but debug shows 2-year gap (-39 to -37)
- [Pseudosociological] "affinal kin household" line 461, "affinal kin" line 463, "with kin nearby" line 455
- [Minor figurative] "Pain locked her hip" - slightly figurative

**Changes made:**
- Added Dharaka's death after Sīlā's marriage to Rudda: "Dharaka died the next year, worn by labor and fever."
- Added Kālī's death in the paragraph about midlife: "Her mother Kālī had died some years earlier, after seasons of recurring fever."
- Changed "A year later she carried another pregnancy" → "Two years later she carried another pregnancy"
- Changed "his kin household" → "her late husband's family"
- Changed "Her affinal kin washed her body" → "Her husband's relatives washed her body"
- Changed "with kin nearby" → "with family nearby"

## 0141-bhadrā
**Issues found:**

- [Pseudosociological] "joint household" line 250 - uses "joint"

**Changes made:**
- Added Datta (paternal grandfather) in the second paragraph: introduced alongside Devī as the household authorities
- Changed "father's joint household under his parents' authority" → "father's household, shared with his parents"

---

## 0142-devi
**Issues found:**
- [Chronology] Line 375-376: "By 2022 Radha's health began to fail... In 2021 the family's money troubles worsened" - jumps backward in time within the same paragraph
- [Minor figurative] "brought the house inward" line 365 - slightly figurative phrasing

**Changes made:**
- Fixed chronology: changed "In 2021 the family's money troubles worsened" → "From the pregnancy onward, the family's money troubles worsened" to avoid backward time jump after Nikhil's 2022 birth paragraph
- Changed "brought the house inward" → "kept everyone inside"

- [Missing death] Uncle Bora dies -1330 (Leni age 34) - mentioned at age 29 piglet dispute but death never shown
- [Dead character error] Narrative said "Tina died when Leni was thirty-four" but debug shows Tina dies -1326, THREE YEARS AFTER Leni's death in -1329. Tina outlives Leni.
- [Consistency error] Karo mentioned as available at age 30 ("through her brother Karo or her uncle Bora") but Karo died at age 28
- [Pseudosociological] "kin ties" line 400
- [Pseudosociological] "Her kin washed her body" line 438

**Changes made:**
- Added Wari's death (age 27): "Wari died when Leni was twenty-seven, during an outbreak of fever that swept through several hamlets."

- Added Bora's death (age 34): "Bora, her father's brother who had helped settle disputes and speak on her behalf, died when Leni was thirty-four."
- Removed false Tina death - replaced with "Tina still came by sometimes, though the two sisters never grew warm." (Tina survives Leni per debug)
- Removed Karo from age-30 paragraph (he was dead): "through her brother Karo or her uncle Bora" → "through her uncle Bora"
- Changed "kin ties" → "family ties"
- Changed "Her kin washed her body" → "The women of the hamlet washed her body"

- [Missing death] Mary (sister) dies 1992 - not mentioned in narrative
- [Missing death] Eileen (sister) dies 1997 - not mentioned in narrative
- [Missing death] Seán (brother) dies 2000, same year as Arthur - not mentioned in narrative
- [Chronology error] Pub fight paragraph (1948) appears AFTER 1956 events (Bernard's death, daughter Eileen's birth), jumping backwards in time
- [Clarity] Daughter named "Eileen" (1956) same as sister "Eileen" (1919) - potentially confusing for reader

**Changes made:**
- **[DEVIATED FROM DEBUG]** Changed "fifth of six children" → "third of six children" - debug had birth_order_position: 5 but sibling birth years clearly show Arthur as 3rd born
- Added Mary's death (1992) in the later life section
- Added sister Eileen's death (1997) - placed alongside Rita's death in 1996
- Added Seán's death (2000) - mentioned in the final paragraph as dying earlier that same year

- [Developmental implausibility] "By 2025, Aditya reads and writes Marathi easily" and "copies prayers from a small notebook" - at age 4 (born May 2021), this is developmentally implausible. Most children don't read and write fluently until age 5-7. The debug "Functionally literate" describes his eventual literacy, not his current state.

**Changes made:**
- Changed "By 2025, Aditya reads and writes Marathi easily. He copies prayers from a small notebook, and he helps Mahesh count change at the shop, sometimes losing focus and needing reminders." → "By 2025, Aditya recognizes a few Marathi letters and can trace his name. He helps Mahesh count change at the shop, sometimes losing focus and needing reminders."

## 0150-zhao-yong
**Issues found:**
- [Missing character presence] Grandmother "Madam Zhao" mentioned once in paragraph 1 setting out bowls, then essentially disappears. Per debug, she was "hands-on caretaker, especially during illnesses" - should appear during ditch accident recovery and chronic illness scenes.
- [Chronology unclear] "That spring his cough returned" - unclear which spring (1645 or 1646) since Teacher Qian appears "In 1645" just before.
- [Redundant death mention] "His grandfather died in 1645" as standalone sentence in final paragraph - redundant since grandfather's death can be better integrated into the illness narrative.
- [Missing grandmother in illness] Ditch accident recovery only mentions mother feeding him; grandmother should be present per her debug role.

**Changes made:**
- Named grandmother "Grandmother Zhao" in paragraph 1 and added her presence throughout
- Added grandmother to illness/recovery scenes (ditch accident recovery, chronic fever care)
- Clarified chronology: "That spring" → "In spring 1645" and clarified the winter cough return
- Integrated grandfather's death into the illness narrative instead of standalone sentence in final paragraph
- Added grandmother's presence at death scene

- [Minor figurative] "Each death tightened the compound" - slightly figurative
- [Clarity] Acatl described as "his mother's brother" but Coatl was already introduced as mother's brother; debug shows Acatl is "older male relative" not necessarily mother's brother

**Changes made:**
- Added grandmother Iztac's death (1207) with context showing her nurturing role and how the compound changed after
- Added uncle Coatl's death (1228) with brief funeral scene and transition of household authority

## 0160-ismail

- [Missing sibling context] Yahya (older brother) died in 1266 at age 1, before Ismail's birth - this loss would have shaped the family's anxiety about male infants and should be mentioned for context
- [Clarity] Amina's age not specified - Fatima is described as "ten years old" but Amina (seven) just appears as "her sister Amina"

**Changes made:**

## 0152-miri

- [Major chronology error] Tana's death: narrative says "Tana died that season" during Miri's "fourth year," but debug shows Tana died in 1690 BC when Miri was less than 1 year old (born December 1691 BC). Miri would have no memory of this.
- [Missing sibling] Koru mentioned only at burial scene despite debug describing him as "Main older brother figure" who "brings him small treats (roasted fish bits)"
- [Missing sibling] Hako (younger brother, born 1689 BC, dies 1686 BC at age 3) completely missing from narrative - died when Miri was ~4-5

- [Missing character introduction] Mama Halima (household worker/nanny) appears serving tea at the end without any introduction; should be established earlier as a regular presence
- [Vague illness] "fell seriously ill" - debug indicates this was during a "rainy-season vector-borne outbreak period" in the coastal zone; could be more specific about the illness (likely malaria or dengue)

**Changes made:**

- [Missing sibling] Orkpe (younger sister, born 1842, outlives protagonist) - completely missing from narrative despite surviving him
- [Chronology error] Yam theft (1873-1874) placed AFTER 1879 events (Terfa's death, the move, the assault) - creates confusing backward timeline

---

## 0170-thushari

- [Clarity] Line 365: "a close relative died suddenly, leaving a young child without a stable home. Thushari brought the child into her parents' house" - unclear whether "the child" is the deceased relative's child or the relative themselves; debug says "one of the deceased's young children" so should clarify

**Changes made:**
- Changed `lifestyle: "FLAG: Urban"` → `lifestyle: "Rural"`
- Changed "a close relative died suddenly, leaving a young child without a stable home. Thushari brought the child into her parents' house" → "a close relative died suddenly, leaving a young child orphaned. Thushari brought the orphan into her parents' house"

- [Missing death] Suma (second partner) dies -53605 (Yonu age 48) - relationship mentioned to end but her death never shown; narrative_plan says "lasts until Suma later dies as an older adult"
- [Chronology error] Narrative says "At thirty-five Kori died" but debug shows Kori dies -53624, which is when Yonu was 29 (born -53653). Kori should die BEFORE Ena's death (at 31).
- [Dead character as alive] Tuma appears helping with Gamu's death (age 42) but Tuma died when Yonu was 35
- [Pseudosociological] "Mira left with her kin" line 381, "Suma's kin" line 393, "His kin wrapped him" line 409 - three uses of "kin"

**Changes made:**
- Fixed Kori's death timing: moved from age 35 to age 29, placed correctly before Ena's death paragraph (since Ena dies at 31)
- Added Tuma's death (age 35): "Tuma, who had helped raise him after his mother died and whose bitter-leaf remedies had eased his bruises after the beating, died that same year."

## 0180-zi
**Issues found:**
- [Chronology error] Narrative says "Soon after [Zi's death], Mu delivered another daughter, Mo, who died at birth." But per debug data, Mo was born in 1431 BC and Zi died in September 1432 BC. Mo was born AFTER Zi's death and should not be mentioned in Zi's narrative at all—Zi never knew about Mo.

**Changes made:**
- Removed the sentence about Mo's birth/death entirely: "Soon after, Mu delivered another daughter, Mo, who died at birth." (Mo was born after Zi died per debug data)

---

## 0178-nara
**Issues found:**
- [Clarity] "Nara's older sister Mina had already died" - Mina died in 696 BC when Nara was about 2 years old, not before Nara's birth; phrasing makes it sound like a pre-birth death

**Changes made:**

---

## 0175-akwele
**Issues found:**

- [Missing death] Mother Afi Lartey died in 1996 - last mentioned at father's death in 1988, death never mentioned
- [Sibling clarity] "Ama came after Akwele, then the brothers and sisters in a long line" - too vague; later paragraph says Kofi/Nii/Yaw came "in quick succession" but skips Esi and Adjoa entirely
- [Chronology] Thefts paragraph says "In 1988 a coin purse went missing" and "In 1992 someone took a bag of onions" but follows the 1990s paragraph - backward chronology

**Changes made:**
- Rewrote sibling introduction: "Ama came two years after Akwele, then more: Kwame in 1962, who died before his first birthday; Kofi in 1963; Nii in 1965; Esi in 1967; Adjoa in 1970; and Yaw, the youngest, in 1972"
- Removed redundant sibling listing from early 1970s paragraph (now just mentions Esi)
- Added Esi's death: "In 1974, Esi fell sick with a fever and died at seven. The household absorbed the loss as it had absorbed Kwame's death years before—quietly, with prayer and then work."
- Added mother's death: "Afi died in 1996. Akwele had expected it—her mother had been slowing down for years—but the funeral still drained what savings she had, and the compound felt quieter afterward."
- Fixed chronology: "Thefts started as small humiliations. In 1988 a coin purse..." → "Thefts had been part of life since the late 1980s. A coin purse..." (removed specific years to avoid backward jumps)

---

## 0173-zhou-guorong
**Issues found:**
- [Missing death] Mother Lin Xiuying dies in 2024 per debug data, but death never stated in narrative. Story ends in late 2025 and mentions keeping her photo on the shelf, implying death, but the death event itself was omitted.

**Changes made:**

---

## 0172-karna
**Issues found:**
- [CRITICAL - Missing death] Mother Sita dies in 842 per debug data, but narrative has her alive in 843 caring for dying Karna ("Padma and Sita gave him thin rice water")
- [Vague hedging] "a lump of jaggery or roasted gram" - LLM indecision
- [Pseudosociological] "before she could be properly named by the wider kin" - awkward phrasing with "wider kin"
- [Chronology] Paragraph starts with "In 836 and 837 the rains had already turned uncertain" after previous paragraph covered events through 840 - temporal backtrack

**Changes made:**
- Added Sita's death: "That same year Sita died. She had grown thin and slow through the debt years, and a fever took her before the harvest. The household felt emptier without her quiet routines—the pinch of rice at the courtyard edge, the early mornings at the quern."
- Fixed final scene: "Padma and Sita gave him thin rice water" → "Padma gave him thin rice water" (Sita already dead)
- Changed "jaggery or roasted gram" → "jaggery"
- Changed "before she could be properly named by the wider kin" → "within a week"
- Reorganized paragraphs: moved "The rains turned uncertain in 836 and 837" to start of children paragraph, fixing chronological flow

---

## 0189-sena
**Issues found:**
- [Clarity] Line 217 says "Four older sisters were alive in the yard" then names only three (Suma, Mira, Rani) plus "the memory of Dasi" who died before Sena's birth. Confusing phrasing—a memory is not a person alive in the yard.

**Changes made:**
- Rewrote: "Four older sisters were alive in the yard when Sena arrived: Suma, Mira, and Rani, and the memory of Dasi" → "Three older sisters were alive when Sena arrived: Suma, ten years old; Mira, six; and Rani, two. A fourth, Dasi, had died in infancy years earlier."

## 0191-kima
**Issues found:**

- [Figurative] Line 338: "as if shame was a tool to get results" - unnecessary metaphor

## 0199-yama
**Issues found:**
- [Chronology] Line 362: "Ruma died when Yama was twenty-nine" - debug says Ruma dies -6778, Yama born -6805, so age 27 not 29
- [Repetition] Line 360 and 362 both start with "When Yama was twenty-seven" after fixing the above
- [Pseudosociological] Line 360: "greeting every adult by kin term" - academic jargon

**Changes made:**
- "Ruma died when Yama was twenty-nine" → "Ruma died that same year" (connects to preceding assault at age 27)
- "by kin term" → "by name or relation"

## 0041-nathono
**Issues found:**
- [Pass 1] Kawunza (senior aunt/mediator) mentioned in narrative plan as prominent ages 15-45 was completely absent from narrative
- [Pass 2] Nathima's death (daughter, age 19) mentioned too briefly given narrative plan says it "destabilizes Nathono emotionally"
- [Pass 2] Sick relative (1411-1412) unnamed when could be specific
- [Pass 3] Breathing-checking anxiety from childhood not connected to later episodes
- [Pass 4] Chronology error: father's death (1412) paragraph placed before nursing sick relative (1411) paragraph
- [Pass 6] "Heavy rains returned in some seasons" - vague timing
- [Pass 7] "close kin" - pseudosociological jargon
- [Pass 8] "The absence opened something in her that would not close" - figurative language

**Changes made:**
- Added Kawunza to marriage disputes: "Her mother's sister Kawunza, who held weight in the compound, had to step between them more than once."
- Added Kawunza after assault: "Kawunza came afterward to negotiate with Sarima's people and arranged terms to prevent further violence."
- Added Kawunza during economic crisis: "Kawunza backed her decisions in front of the elders, though privately she told Nathono to soften her tone."
- Expanded Nathima's death paragraph with fever, nursing, rituals, and deeper grief reaction
- Identified sick relative as "Kawina's older sister, who had come to stay in the compound after her own husband's death"
- Added callback to breathing-checking: "The old habit returned—waking in the night to check that Nakhulo was still breathing"
- Reordered paragraphs: sick relative (1411) now comes before father's death (1412)
- "Heavy rains returned in some seasons" → "Heavy rains returned in 1413 and 1414"
- "close kin" → "her daughters"
- "The absence opened something in her that would not close" → "This grief did not lift"

**Additional issues found (second pass):**
- [AI-slop] "Deaths came early in the family" - generic opener
- [Confusing structure] Siblings introduced piecemeal and out of order - Namalya and Nankula appear without prior introduction
- [Vague] Namutolo's "shield" unexplained
- [Awkward] "The care lasted into 1412" - unclear duration and emotional impact
- [Duplicate markers] Multiple instances of "In YEAR, at age X" redundant dating
- [Vague] Sarima appears with no introduction
- [Weird dating] "1415 and 1416", "1416 and 1417" - pick one
- [Underdeveloped] Affair too brief and vague
- [Missing character] Kawina disappears after the affair

**Additional changes made:**
- Rewrote sibling paragraph to introduce all five surviving siblings upfront with relationships: Namutolo (eldest, handled disputes), Nankula (quiet, practical), Nampita (playmate), Namalya (sister she followed)
- Removed redundant "She was the seventh child" and "Her closest sibling was Nampita" after sibling intro
- Rewrote Namutolo's death to explain his role: "He had been the one who dealt with outsiders—tribute collectors, men from other lineages with grievances"
- Named sick relative Nalupe, gave emotional landing: "Nathono felt the loss less as grief than as exhaustion finally allowed to end"
- Removed Nankula's birth year (already introduced)
- Introduced Sarima properly: "a woman from a neighboring compound who also managed stores"
- Changed "Sarima's kin" to "Sarima's brothers" for clarity
- Fixed dating: "Two years later, in 1415 and 1416" → "By 1415"; "In 1416 and 1417" → "In 1416"
- Expanded affair: added characterization of Chimwala, how meetings progressed, and aftermath with Kawina
- Added resolution of Kawina relationship: "Kawina knew or suspected—it was hard to say which—but he stayed. They settled into something quieter than their early years, less fighting, less warmth."
- Added Kawina to death scene: "while Nankaya and Kawina tried to feed her thin gruel"
- Fixed duplicate temporal markers throughout ("At thirty-eight, in 1417" → "Around her thirty-eighth year"; "forty-one, in 1420" → "In 1420"; "In 1425, at forty-six" → "The following year")
