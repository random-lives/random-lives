## 0248-hsiao-hsiu-chen.md

**Reviewed:** 2026-01-22

**Summary:** Contemporary Taiwanese woman born December 8, 1972 in Taichung, Taiwan. Still alive at age 52. Han Taiwanese (Minnan/Hoklo-speaking), upper-middle class background. Migrated overseas in 1998, runs a Taiwan-linked import/specialty foods business. Very high extraversion (94th percentile), moderately high neuroticism (65th), below-average honesty-humility (37th), very low physical attractiveness (10th). Domestic violence during marriage (ages 29-33), major business achievement (ages 36-41). One daughter (Grace, b. 2006). Father died 2016, grandmother died 1994.

### Issues Found

**Missing trait visibility (1 issue fixed):**
1. Very low physical attractiveness (10th percentile) was not shown anywhere in the narrative—this is a "must be visible" extreme trait

**Figurative Language (2 instances fixed):**
1. "a laugh that carried a warning inside it" - figurative (laughs can't carry warnings)
2. "response time turned curiosity into sales" - abstract/figurative

### Changes Made

1. Added passage showing low physical attractiveness after migration description: "Hsiu-chen was not a woman people looked at twice on the street—her face was plain, her features unremarkable—but she drew attention anyway by talking first and loudest, by remembering names and making people feel noticed."
2. Replaced figurative language: "to change the subject with a laugh that carried a warning inside it" → "to change the subject with a laugh and a quick pivot to the child"
3. Replaced abstract phrase: "response time turned curiosity into sales" → "customers who got a fast reply came back"

### Review Checklist

- [x] **Timeline**: All periods from 0-52 covered with appropriate density
- [x] **Household composition**: Birth household (nuclear with parents, grandmother as frequent caretaker) and current overseas household both clear
- [x] **Sibling introduction**: N/A (only child, 0 siblings)
- [x] **Character tracking**: All named characters from plan appear appropriately (Chih-ming, Li-juan, Huang A-ma, David Chen, Grace, Lina Wu, Mr. Kuo, Auntie Mei, Ms. Patel)
- [x] **Death audit**: Both deaths covered (grandmother Huang A-ma 1994, father Hsiao Chih-ming 2016)
- [x] **Event weight**: Both structured incidents well-integrated (domestic violence ages 29-33, major business achievement ages 36-41)
- [x] **Paragraph coherence**: Each paragraph has one clear theme
- [x] **Chronology markers**: Dates and ages consistent throughout; no redundant year+age
- [x] **Vague language**: None found
- [x] **Abstract claims**: None found
- [x] **Historical grounding**: Excellent period detail for Taiwan 1972-present: martial law ending 1987, SARS 2003, 2008 financial crisis, COVID-19 pandemic; appropriate material culture (household altar, temple visits, Lunar New Year practices)
- [x] **Jargon/naming**: Names appropriately Taiwanese (Hsiao surname, Hsiu-chen given name, Hokkien grandmother name Huang A-ma); David Chen appropriate for overseas Taiwanese
- [x] **AI-slop**: Two figurative phrases removed
- [x] **Trait visibility**: All notable traits now shown
  - Very high extraversion (94th): talking to everyone, organizing events, remembering names, drawing attention through social presence
  - Moderately high neuroticism (65th): looping thoughts, sleep trouble, SARS anxieties, COVID checklists
  - Below-average honesty-humility (37th): managing impressions, selective self-presentation, keeping things inside the family
  - Very low physical attractiveness (10th): now explicitly shown
- [x] **Length**: ~2,400 words, appropriate for still-living adult age 52

### Notes

Strong narrative with excellent integration of personality traits through concrete actions. The very high extraversion is shown throughout via social behaviors (talking first, organizing gatherings, building customer networks) rather than being labeled. The domestic violence period is handled matter-of-factly, showing the pattern of abuse, her coping strategies (staying with friend, seeking community advice), and her practical response (controlling finances, maintaining public face) without melodrama. The business arc from small trading to established storefront is well-paced and connected to the diaspora community networks. Historical grounding is excellent: the democratization after martial law, SARS, the 2008 financial crisis, and COVID-19 all appear at appropriate points and affect her life in concrete ways. The bilingual code-switching (Mandarin/Hokkien/English) is well-integrated. The religious practice (household altar, temple visits, ancestor rites) is presented as routine family practice rather than formal observance, appropriate for the "Chinese folk religion blend" noted in debug data. Only issues were missing visibility for the very low attractiveness trait and two minor figurative phrases.

## 0249-sola.md

**Reviewed:** 2026-01-22

**Summary:** Pre-Columbian woman from the Andean foothills (modern Bolivia), born 5007 BC, died 4966 BC at age 41 from accidental fall. Horticulturalist in a small community practicing ancestor veneration. Very high neuroticism (100th percentile), very low honesty-humility (4th percentile), high attractiveness (90th percentile), moderately high agreeableness (71st), low conscientiousness (32nd). Anxiety disorder. First of six daughters in a polygynous household. Long-distance migration at 19. Ten children (three infant deaths, one son dies at 7). Widowed at 34, repartnered into violent blended household. Chronic illness from repeated fevers. Known for productive garden management despite illness.

### Issues Found

**Missing Deaths (3 issues fixed):**
1. Father Teka's death (age 18, before migration) not mentioned
2. Mother Wira's death (age 24) not mentioned—narrative plan noted this as "removing Nomi's main emotional anchor"
3. Son Oka's death at age 7 (when Sola is 27) not mentioned—narrative plan noted this as "core grief that intensifies her anxiety"

**Missing Named Characters (2 issues fixed):**
1. Daughter Nala (born year after Ima, survives to 65) not mentioned despite being specified in narrative plan
2. Leka (gardener woman, prominence ages 28-38) not mentioned despite being specified as teaching seed-saving techniques

**Missing Trait Visibility (1 issue fixed):**
1. High attractiveness (90th percentile) was not shown—this is a "must be visible" trait

**Figurative Language (3 issues fixed):**
1. "became her shadow" - metaphor
2. "Lean seasons made her sharp" - abstract figurative
3. "She rose with a tight, anxious energy" - abstract

**Chronology Issues (2 issues fixed):**
1. Rina's death listed as "when Sola was twenty-three" but per narrative plan she dies -4977 when Sola is 29
2. "Teka met visitors with gifts" appeared after Teka's death had been established

### Changes Made

1. Added Teka's death before migration: "Teka died during Sola's eighteenth year, before she left. He had been the center of the household's alliances, the one who met visitors and arranged exchanges. Without him the household lost standing."
2. Added Wira's death at age 24: "When Sola was twenty-four, word came that her mother Wira had died. A visiting kinsman brought the news along with a small bundle of woven fiber and a handful of dried seeds... She had no one now who remembered her as a child."
3. Added Oka's death at age 27: "When Sola was twenty-seven, Oka fell sick with a fever that would not break. He was seven years old, bold and energetic, her first child... After that, Sola's checking grew worse. She woke in the night to press her hand to her other children's chests, counting their breaths."
4. Added Nala: "Nala, born the year after Ima, grew into a steady worker who helped with the seed-saving and watched the younger ones."
5. Added Leka: "An older woman named Leka, who had gardened that stretch for years, showed her where water held longest and which seeds did best in the thin soil."
6. Added attractiveness passage: "Sola had grown into a woman others noticed. Her face was well-shaped, her body strong and proportioned in ways that drew attention. Her father Teka used this when arranging the marriage exchange; the terms favored their household."
7. Fixed "became her shadow" → "followed her everywhere"
8. Fixed "Lean seasons made her sharp" → "Lean seasons taught her to watch and take"
9. Fixed "She rose with a tight, anxious energy" → "She woke anxious"
10. Fixed Rina's death age from 23 to 29 (moved paragraph to correct chronological position)
11. Fixed "Teka met visitors" → "The household heads met visitors"

  - Honesty-humility (4th): taking food, making up stories about animals/spoilage
  - Attractiveness (90th): now shown in marriage negotiation passage
- [x] **Length**: ~2,450 words after edits, appropriate for adult who lived to 41 with many structured incidents

### Notes

Strong narrative overall with excellent integration of personality traits through concrete actions. The very high neuroticism manifests through counting, checking, hypervigilance, and worsening anxiety after each loss—shown not told. The very low honesty-humility is demonstrated through the systematic pattern of taking from others' stores and lying about it. The achievement (successful garden management despite illness) is well-balanced against the domestic violence and accumulated grief. The ancestor veneration practices provide good cultural grounding throughout. The main issues were missing deaths (particularly Wira and Oka, which were specified as critical in the narrative plan) and missing trait visibility for attractiveness. Note: The narrative_plan lists the protagonist as "Nomi" but the generated narrative correctly uses "Sola" throughout—this is a naming discrepancy in the metadata, not the story itself.

## 0242-mahammad.md

**Reviewed:** 2026-01-22

**Summary:** 19th-century Azerbaijani man from Quba district in the Russian Caucasus. Born July 3, 1828, died February 18, 1859 at age 30 from respiratory infection. Illegitimate son of village headman Haji Rahim, raised by mother Gülsüm. Estate manager.

Married to Nabat, four children (two died in infancy). Five siblings (three died before adulthood). Chronic malaria-like fevers from age 19; riding accident at 23.

### Issues Found

**Missing trait visibility (1 issue fixed):**
1. Very low Openness (11th percentile) was not shown—narrative plan specified "dismisses novel farming suggestions and insists on 'how it's always been done'"

**Figurative Language (9 instances fixed):**
1. "fixed a ceiling over him in public" - metaphorical
2. "The household filled and thinned quickly" - figurative (households don't fill/thin)
3. "Those deaths tightened the family's attention around Mahammad" - figurative
4. "the stain of his birth" - metaphorical
5. "The empire's rules pressed in" - figurative
6. "Marriage repaired parts of his standing" - figurative
7. "the child fixed his place in the household" - figurative
8. "until his thoughts steadied" - abstract/figurative
9. "poor harvests tightened grain supplies" - figurative

### Changes Made

1. "fixed a ceiling over him in public" → "but it also meant he would never be acknowledged as a son"
2. "The household filled and thinned quickly" → "Children came and died"
3. "Those deaths tightened the family's attention around Mahammad" → "After those deaths, the family watched Mahammad more closely"
4. "the stain of his birth" → "though he was illegitimate"
5. "The empire's rules pressed in" → "The empire's rules grew stricter"
6. "Marriage repaired parts of his standing" → "Marriage gave him some respectability"
7. "the child fixed his place in the household more firmly than any spoken promise" → "having a son to carry the household forward"
8. "until his thoughts steadied" → "until he could speak again"
9. "poor harvests tightened grain supplies" → "poor harvests left less grain in the stores"
10. Added passage showing very low openness: "When a younger man suggested trying a new crop rotation he had heard about from a trader, Mahammad refused. He wanted the old ways, the tried paths, the tenants his household had always dealt with."

### Review Checklist

- [x] **Timeline**: All periods from 0-30 covered with appropriate density
- [x] **Household composition**: Birth household (mother's kin compound with grandmother) and death household (stem family with mother, wife, children) both clear
- [x] **Sibling introduction**: All five siblings introduced as they appear (Zeynab 1830, Fatma 1832, Khadija 1836, Aghabala 1839, Iskandar 1842)
- [x] **Character tracking**: All named characters from narrative plan appear (Karbalayi Musa, Mullah Suleyman, Rashid, Bibi-Peri, Ivan Petrov, Nabat)
- [x] **Death audit**: All deaths covered (grandmother Sakina 1841, Fatma 1835, Aghabala 1839, Iskandar 1844, daughter Zahra 1851, Zeynab 1854, Haji Rahim 1856, daughter Sakina 1858)
- [x] **Event weight**: Structured incidents (chronic illness, riding accident) both well-integrated with consequences
- [x] **Paragraph coherence**: Each paragraph has one theme
- [x] **Chronology markers**: No redundant year+age; dates consistent throughout
- [x] **Vague language**: None found
- [x] **Abstract claims**: None found after edits
- [x] **Historical grounding**: Good period detail for 1820s-1850s Russian Caucasus (administrative tightening, cholera waves, local intermediaries, Shi'a Muslim practice)
- [x] **Jargon/naming**: Names appropriate for Turkic Azerbaijani context (Mahammad, Gülsüm, Nabat, Zeynab); Persian phrases mentioned; Russian clerk Ivan Petrov appropriate
- [x] **AI-slop**: Nine instances of figurative language removed
- [x] **Trait visibility**: All extreme traits now shown (attractiveness through remarks, low extraversion through withdrawal, low honesty-humility through skimming, very low openness now shown through rejecting new farming methods)
- [x] **Length**: ~2,050 words, appropriate for adult who lived to 30

### Notes

Strong narrative with excellent historical grounding in the Russian Caucasus administrative context. The illegitimacy stigma and its effects on his social position are well-threaded throughout. The chronic illness (recurring fevers) and riding accident create meaningful constraints on his working life and show his vulnerability within the kin hierarchy. The death of Haji Rahim in 1856 is a clear turning point that changes his status. Good concrete details: cholera-era water precautions, Russian paperwork requirements, estate management rounds, local patronage networks. The main issue was missing visibility for the very low openness trait and multiple instances of figurative language.

## 0238-françois.md

**Reviewed:** 2026-01-22

**Summary:** Contemporary Chadian boy born July 25, 2019 in Dobem, Logone Occidental region. Sara-speaking (Ngambay variety). Still alive at age 7 (as of 2026). Third of four children in a poor/vulnerable subsistence farming household. Very low extraversion (16th percentile), higher neuroticism (63rd), lower conscientiousness (34th), lower openness (29th), lower honesty-humility (39th). Infant brother Michel died in 2021. Family moved to nearby town around age 4. Basic literacy achieved.

### Issues Found

**Missing named character (1 issue fixed):**
1. Awa (market stallholder) from narrative plan was not mentioned despite being specified as prominent ages 3-6, showing "how household cash pressures shape daily choices"

**Missing trait visibility (3 issues fixed):**
1. Lower conscientiousness (34th percentile) - plan specified "starts copying letters carefully but drifts, forgets his slate/chalk, or abandons the task if corrected sharply" but this was not shown
2. Lower openness (29th percentile) - plan specified "prefers familiar songs and routines... skeptical of new games or unfamiliar foods; watches first before trying" but this was not shown
3. Lower honesty-humility (39th percentile) - plan specified "may blame a sibling for a broken cup or keep a small treat for himself before sharing" but this was not shown

**Figurative language (2 issues fixed):**
1. "Marie's voice went thin" - figurative (voice can't literally go thin)
2. "When prices jumped" - figurative (prices don't jump)

### Changes Made

1. Added Awa to the move/price crisis passage: "A stallholder named Awa sometimes extended Marie small credit or told her which goods were cheapest that week."
2. Added lower openness trait: "When other children brought new games or unfamiliar snacks, he watched first before trying."
3. Added lower conscientiousness trait: "François started carefully but drifted; he sometimes forgot his slate or abandoned the task if corrected sharply."
4. Added lower honesty-humility trait at end: "When food is short, he keeps a small portion for himself before sharing with Paul."
5. Replaced figurative "voice went thin" → "spoke less for months, her words short and flat"
6. Replaced figurative "prices jumped" → "prices rose sharply"

### Review Checklist

- [x] **Timeline**: All periods from 0-7 covered (birth, COVID period ages 0-2, Michel's death age 2, floods/price shock ages 3-4, move age 4, schooling ages 5-7, present age 7)
- [x] **Household composition**: Birth household (father Joseph, mother Marie, grandmother Marguerite, siblings Jean/Paul, infant Michel) clearly specified
- [x] **Sibling introduction**: All siblings introduced appropriately (Jean 2013, Paul 2016, François 2019, Michel 2021)
- [x] **Character tracking**: All named characters from plan now appear (Joseph, Marie, Marguerite, Catéchiste André, Maître Daniel, Awa)
- [x] **Death audit**: Michel's 2021 infant death covered
- [x] **Event weight**: COVID-19 disruption, flooding, price shock, family move all mentioned with appropriate detail
- [x] **Paragraph coherence**: Each paragraph has one theme
- [x] **Chronology markers**: Dates consistent (2019 birth, 2021 Michel's death, 2022 floods, 2023 price crisis/move, 2025 literacy)
- [x] **Vague language**: None found
- [x] **Abstract claims**: None found
- [x] **Historical grounding**: Good detail for contemporary rural Chad (Sara language, rainfed farming, market trading, church/catechist role, COVID disruptions, flooding, inflation)
- [x] **Jargon/naming**: French Christian names appropriate for Sara Catholic family (François, Joseph, Marie, Jean, Paul, Michel, André, Daniel)
- [x] **AI-slop**: Figurative language removed
- [x] **Trait visibility**: All notable traits now shown (very low extraversion through quietness/letting Paul answer; higher neuroticism through waking at coughs; lower conscientiousness through drifting/forgetting; lower openness through watching before trying; lower honesty-humility through keeping food for himself)
- [x] **Length**: ~550 words, appropriate for still-living 7-year-old

### Notes

Clean narrative overall with good contemporary historical grounding (COVID-19, commodity price shocks, regional flooding). The family's precarity is well-established through concrete details: hoe and worn machete, salt and oil sold in reused bottles, measuring millet carefully. Michel's death is handled with appropriate restraint. The personality traits were mostly shown through the extraversion and neuroticism, but needed additions for conscientiousness, openness, and honesty-humility. The move from Dobem to nearby town is well-motivated by the price shock. Good integration of religious practice (church, catechist, hymns) alongside traditional practices (protective charms, grandmother's taboos).

## 0231-unnamed-infant.md

**Reviewed:** 2026-01-22

**Summary:** Unnamed male infant born and died June 23, 3001 BC on the White Nile (modern Sudan). Hunter-gatherer family. Died at birth from birth asphyxia/obstructed labor. Third child in a mother-centered household with absent father.

### Issues Found

**Naming (3 issues fixed):**
1. "Older Brother" was a placeholder, not an actual name
2. "Older Sister" was a placeholder, not an actual name
3. "Senior Midwife/Healer" was a placeholder, not an actual name

**Minor prose (1 issue fixed):**
1. "child three of three" - awkward phrasing

### Changes Made

1. Renamed "Older Brother" → "Koro" (appropriate for Nilo-Saharan context)
2. Renamed "Older Sister" → "Amina" (appropriate for Nilo-Saharan context)
3. Renamed "Senior Midwife/Healer" → "Naja" (appropriate for context)
4. Changed "Maternal Grandmother" → "Her own mother" (cleaner prose)
5. Changed "child three of three" → "her third child"

### Review Checklist

- [x] **Family structure**: Mother, absent father, maternal grandmother, two older siblings (Koro and Amina) all present
- [x] **Chronology**: Timeline consistent (same-day birth and death)
- [x] **Death coverage**: Stillbirth handled appropriately—baby never drew breath, so no "living infant moment" expected
- [x] **Named characters**: All placeholder names replaced with actual names; Naja (midwife) appears
- [x] **AI-slop**: No figurative language or personification found
- [x] **Naming**: Names now appropriate for proto-Nilotic/Nilo-Saharan context; good phonetic variety
- [x] **Length**: ~260 words, appropriate for infant (guideline 150-300)
- [x] **Historical context**: Good grounding in 3rd millennium BC White Nile forager culture: animistic beliefs, spirit appeasement, acacia savanna ecology, burial practices

### Notes

Clean infant narrative with appropriate cultural detail. The birth complications and death are handled with restraint. The mother-centered household structure is well-established. Burial practice (shallow scrape above flood line with beads and dried fish offering) reflects plausible regional practices. The main issue was placeholder names for family members and the midwife, which have been corrected with names appropriate for a Nilo-Saharan linguistic context.

## 0227-unnamed-infant.md

**Reviewed:** 2026-01-22

**Summary:** Ming dynasty infant girl born January 17, 1602 in Nantong, Jiangsu, China. Fourth of eight children in a tenant cultivator family. Died January 23, 1602 (6 days old) from neonatal infection/umbilical sepsis. Two older sisters died in 1595; one older sister (Zhang Yulan, 18) helped with the birth.

### Issues Found

**Minor prose improvements (2 issues fixed):**
1. Previous infant losses could be better connected to ongoing family grief/ritual
2. "murmured a request" was slightly indirect phrasing

### Changes Made

1. Added detail about continued mourning: "and Li shi still burned paper for them at Qingming" after mentioning the 1595 deaths
2. Changed "murmured a request for the baby's safety" → "asked the ancestors to watch over the child" (more direct)

### Review Checklist

- [x] **Family structure**: Parents (Zhang Shunhe, Li shi), older sister (Zhang Yulan age 18), two deceased sisters (ages 6 and 3, died 1595), midwife all present. Future siblings correctly omitted.
- [x] **Chronology**: Timeline consistent (Jan 17 birth, Jan 23 death; 1595 sibling deaths)
- [x] **Deaths coverage**: Prior sibling deaths mentioned appropriately; infant's death handled directly
- [x] **Named characters**: Father, mother, older sister, and midwife all have clear roles
- [x] **Living infant moment**: Baby shown being wrapped, kept warm, cared for before illness
- [x] **AI-slop**: No figurative language or personification
- [x] **Naming**: Names appropriate for late Ming dynasty rural China (Zhang surname, Yulan for older sister)
- [x] **Length**: ~200 words, appropriate for infant (guideline 150-300)
- [x] **Historical context**: Good grounding in Ming dynasty Jiangsu (county yamen, village headmen, Jianghuai Mandarin, Tudi earth god, ancestral tablets, kang heated bed, paper money burning)

### Notes

Clean, well-crafted infant narrative with strong historical and cultural detail. The family context is economically established: tenant farmer, rented strips plus small owned patch, chickens and greens near the door. The prior infant losses (two girls in 1595) are mentioned early to establish context. The older sister Yulan is given concrete actions (hauling water, mending shoes, warming bricks). The neonatal sepsis progression (umbilical infection, foul cord stump) is medically appropriate. Burial customs (small coffin, rice, incense, paper money) are culturally accurate for Ming-era rural China. Only minor prose polishing needed.

- [x] **Household composition**: Birth household (laboureur parents, 5 siblings) and marriage household (husband, children) both clear
- [x] **Sibling introduction**: All siblings introduced in Para 3 before individual deaths
- [x] **Character tracking**: Marguerite Lemaire now appears during crisis; all named characters have appropriate arcs
- [x] **Death audit**: All 11 deaths during her lifetime covered (2 infant siblings before birth, Louis 1753, Catherine 1764, stillbirth 1770, infant Louis 1775, father 1778, mother 1782, husband 1790, daughter Marguerite 1806, brother Jacques 1814)
- [x] **Event weight**: All major events (premarital sex, miscarriage, elder care, husband's illness/death, Revolution, economic crisis) have plausible mechanisms
- [x] **Paragraph coherence**: Each paragraph has one theme
- [x] **Chronology markers**: Events now in chronological order; no redundant year+age
- [x] **Vague language**: None remaining
- [x] **Abstract claims**: All converted to concrete descriptions
- [x] **Historical grounding**: Good period detail for 18th-century rural France; Louis XV reference added
- [x] **Jargon/naming**: Names appropriately French; "laboureur" kept as historical term
- [x] **AI-slop**: All figurative language and patterns fixed
- [x] **Length**: ~2,300 words, appropriate for elder who lived to 80

### Notes

Strong narrative overall with excellent integration of personality traits (high conscientiousness shown through household order and sharp corrections, low agreeableness through blunt confrontations, high neuroticism through anxious checking and controlling behavior). The life arc from comfortable laboureur's daughter through childbearing, elder care, widowhood, Revolution, and old age is well-paced. Good historical grounding in 18th-century rural France: Picard dialect, folk Catholicism alongside formal practice, laboureur social position, Revolutionary religious conflict, wartime requisitions. The main issues were chronological ordering and missing character presence for Marguerite Lemaire and Jacques in later life.

## 0209-zoe.md

**Reviewed:** 2026-01-22

**Summary:** Byzantine peasant woman born 998 AD in central Anatolia (modern Turkey). Peasant farmer and midwife/healer. Very high extraversion (95th percentile), very low agreeableness (6th), very low openness (4th), low honesty-humility (18th), depressive disorder. Domestic violence victim during marriage. Property theft victim in widowhood. Five siblings (3 infant deaths, 1 childhood death, 1 survives to 47). Two children (both die young—son at 0, daughter at 2). Widowed at 68, dies at 77 from dysentery.

### Issues Found

**Missing trait visibility (3 issues fixed):**
1. Very high attractiveness (91st percentile) was not shown anywhere—this is a "must be visible" trait
2. Very low openness (4th percentile) was not clearly demonstrated through concrete action
3. Low honesty-humility (18th percentile) was not distinctly shown—narrative plan specified leveraging private knowledge and exaggerating others' faults

**Missing named characters (2 issues fixed):**
1. Eudokia (neighbor/birth-assistant, ages 18-45) from narrative plan never appeared despite being specified as prominent
2. Leon (better-off peasant/creditor, ages 30-70) from narrative plan never appeared despite being specified as key in debt/poverty arc

**Figurative Language (2 instances fixed):**
1. "sadness settled into a long season" - metaphor
2. "low spells returned in waves" - metaphor

### Changes Made

1. Added passage showing Zoe's physical attractiveness before marriage: "Zoe had grown into a woman men looked at twice. Her face was well-proportioned, her body strong and curved in ways the village noticed. Mothers pointed her out to sons, and Manouel used this when arranging a match."
2. Added Eudokia and showed very low openness: "A neighbor called Eudokia sometimes assisted at births, and the two women worked together and quarreled in turns. Zoe insisted on the methods her mother had taught: the same prayers, the same herbs, the same way of tying the cord. When Eudokia tried a different poultice she had heard of from a trader's wife, Zoe refused it. She did not want new ways. She wanted the proper way, the way that had always been done."
3. Added passage showing low honesty-humility (leveraging birth secrets): "In disputes she used what she knew from attending births—who had screamed for their mother, whose husband had wept, whose child had come out the wrong way—and wielded these secrets to win arguments or embarrass rivals. People called her sharp, and not kindly."
4. Added Leon to establish the debt/creditor relationship: "Leon, a peasant with more land than most, had lent Stephanos seed grain in a lean year; Zoe resented the debt and the way Leon spoke to her husband, and she resented more that she could say nothing about it."
5. Replaced figurative language: "sadness settled into a long season" → "sadness did not lift"
6. Replaced figurative language: "low spells returned in waves" → "low spells returned"

### Review Checklist

- [x] **Timeline**: All periods from 0-77 covered with appropriate density
- [x] **Household composition**: Nuclear birth household (parents + children) and single-person death household both specified
- [x] **Sibling introduction**: Siblings introduced as they appear chronologically (acceptable for this narrative structure)
- [x] **Character tracking**: Eudokia and Leon now appear; all named characters from plan accounted for (Martha, Petros, Kyriakos, Stephanos)
- [x] **Death audit**: All 10 deaths covered (Maria 997, Niketas 1000, Eleni 1005, Theodoros 1015, father 1038, mother 1044, son 1021, daughter 1026, Georgios 1049, Stephanos 1066)
- [x] **Event weight**: Structured incidents (domestic violence, property theft) both well-integrated with plausible mechanisms
- [x] **Paragraph coherence**: Each paragraph has one clear theme
- [x] **Chronology markers**: Dates and ages consistent throughout
- [x] **Vague language**: None found
- [x] **Abstract claims**: None found
- [x] **Historical grounding**: Byzantine Orthodox practice, village life, peasant agriculture, midwifery all appropriate for 10th-11th century Anatolia
- [x] **Jargon/naming**: Greek names appropriate (Zoe, Manouel, Anna, Stephanos, Kyriakos, Eudokia, Leon, Martha, Petros); Rhomaioi self-identification correct
- [x] **AI-slop**: Two figurative phrases removed
- [x] **Trait visibility**: All extreme traits now shown (extraversion through pushiness/loudness, low agreeableness through quarrels, low openness through rejecting new methods, low honesty-humility through leveraging secrets, high attractiveness through marriage negotiations, depressive disorder through withdrawal/neglect)
- [x] **Length**: ~2,200 words, appropriate for elder (77)

### Notes

Strong narrative with well-paced lifespan coverage. The domestic violence is handled matter-of-factly without melodrama, showing the pattern without dwelling on it gratuitously. The midwifery role is well-integrated and provides natural opportunities to show personality traits. The depressive episodes are shown through concrete behaviors (not eating, lying on mat, staring) rather than labeled. The property theft in old age is effectively connected to her social isolation caused by her abrasive personality. Minor additions needed for missing traits and characters from the narrative plan.

## 0203-suri.md

**Reviewed:** 2026-01-22

**Summary:** 4th-century BC Eastern Sudanic agro-pastoralist woman from the Red Sea hills (modern Sudan). Very high openness (90th), very high extraversion (85th), high neuroticism (70th), very low agreeableness (8th), low honesty-humility (21st). Very short height (3rd percentile). Anxiety disorder. Married to Kori, separated at 40. One child (died at birth). Dies at 56 from respiratory infection.

### Issues Found

**Missing Family Deaths (3 issues fixed):**
1. Grandmother Rina's death (360 BC, when Suri ~21) not mentioned
2. Father Lema's death (345 BC, when Suri ~36) not mentioned
3. Mother Sena's death (334 BC, when Suri ~47) implied but not explicit

**Figurative Language (3 instances fixed):**
1. "Her fear ran alongside her boldness" - personification/figurative
2. "The dry years arrived" - personification
3. "Accusations sharpened" - figurative (accusations don't sharpen)

**Negative Phrasing (1 instance fixed):**
1. "The reunion was not tender" - describes what it wasn't rather than what it was

### Changes Made

1. Added Rina's death after pregnancy complications: "That same year, Rina died. The old woman had been slowing for seasons, and now she was gone. Suri made the offerings at the hearth as Rina had taught her."
2. Added Lema's death in new paragraph: "Her father, Lema, died when Suri was in her mid-thirties. He had never been central to her life—more a voice at disputes than a daily presence—and his death changed little in her household. His kin mourned him and buried him according to custom. Suri attended the rites and then returned to her own compound."
3. Rewrote caregiving section to explicitly show Sena's death: "By her mid-forties, Sena had grown frail..." through "Sena died when Suri was forty-seven. The burial rites were done properly, and Suri scattered flour at the hearth and spoke the names of ancestors, as Rina had once taught her."
4. "Her fear ran alongside her boldness" → "She was bold in daylight and afraid at night"
5. "The dry years arrived when she was in her mid-thirties. Rain failed" → "The rains failed around that same time"
6. "Accusations sharpened" → "People accused each other more often and more harshly"
7. Removed "The reunion was not tender." (redundant; following sentence shows the tension)

### Review Checklist

- [x] **Timeline**: All periods from 0-56 covered
- [x] **Household composition**: Birth household (mother Sena, grandmother Rina, absent father Lema) clearly specified; adult household with Kori; return to Madi's compound after separation
- [x] **Sibling introduction**: All five siblings introduced in childhood (Tamu deceased, Kena, Bori deceased, Madi, Dika)
- [x] **Character tracking**: Named characters Hara (healer), Etem (trader), Jalo (sister-in-law), Guma (elder), Kori (husband) all have clear roles
- [x] **Death audit**: All 7 family deaths now covered (Tamu infant, Bori age 7, Rina ~360 BC, Nari same day as birth, Lema ~345 BC, Sena ~334 BC, Kena late 40s)
- [x] **Event weight**: Pregnancy complications, infant death, domestic violence, separation all have plausible mechanisms
- [x] **Paragraph coherence**: Each paragraph has one theme
- [x] **Chronology markers**: Ages and timing consistent with narrative plan
- [x] **Vague language**: None found
- [x] **Abstract claims**: None found after edits
- [x] **Historical grounding**: Material culture, trade routes, ancestral rites appropriate for 4th-century BC Eastern Sudanic region
- [x] **Jargon/naming**: Names appropriate for inferable Eastern Sudanic context
- [x] **AI-slop**: Figurative language removed
- [x] **Length**: ~2,050 words, appropriate for adult who lived to 56
- [x] **Trait visibility**: All extreme traits shown through concrete actions

### Notes

Strong narrative with excellent integration of personality traits through concrete actions. The very low agreeableness shows through constant conflicts and accusations without being labeled. The high neuroticism + anxiety disorder manifests in night watching and hypervigilance. The caregiving section now properly culminates in Sena's death, creating narrative closure. The structural incidents (pregnancy complications, elderly parent care) are well-integrated. The trade network details (Etem, salt/iron routes) add historical texture. Good pacing across the long lifespan with appropriate attention to marriage, separation, and dependence on kin.

## 0173-zhou-guorong.md

**Reviewed:** 2026-01-21

**Summary:** Contemporary Taiwanese man born 1967, still alive at age 57-58. Factory worker in Changhua/Taichung belt. Very low neuroticism (0th percentile), very low extraversion (9th percentile), low openness (11th), low conscientiousness (12th), high agreeableness (70th), very low honesty-humility (3rd). Substance use disorder (alcohol). Very tall (96th percentile). Widowed in 2016, now living alone after caring for aging parents until their deaths (2021, 2024).

### Issues Found

**Character Tracking (1 issue fixed):**
1. [Pass 4] Li Shengde introduced as "regular companion" but never appeared again despite debug data indicating he was prominent in Guorong's 20s-40s

**Chronology (1 issue fixed):**
1. [Pass 8] "At seventeen, when his grandmother died in 1986" - redundant year + age in same clause

**Abstract Claims (1 issue fixed):**
1. [Pass 10] "The injury made him slower and meaner about small frustrations" - abstract claim without concrete mechanism

**Figurative Language (1 issue fixed):**
1. [Pass 13] "as if caregiving were another machine to run" - simile

### Changes Made

1. Added Shengde to the factory accident scene: "Shengde was the first to reach him, yelling for someone to cut the power"
2. Removed redundant age: "At seventeen, when his grandmother died in 1986" → "When his grandmother died in 1986"
3. Made post-injury behavior concrete: "The injury made him slower and meaner about small frustrations" → "The injury left his grip weak and his temper shorter; he cursed at dropped tools and slammed cabinet doors when things didn't fit"
4. Replaced simile with plain prose: "as if caregiving were another machine to run" → "doing what needed doing and nothing more"

### Review Checklist

- [x] **Timeline**: All periods from 0-57 covered or bridged
- [x] **Household composition**: Three-generation birth household and adult household both clearly specified
- [x] **Sibling introduction**: All three siblings introduced together in Para 3 before any conflicts
- [x] **Character tracking**: Li Shengde now appears twice; all named characters have appropriate arcs
- [x] **Death audit**: All 6 deaths (grandfather 1978, grandmother 1986, brother 2013, wife 2016, father 2021, mother 2024) covered with narrative purpose
- [x] **Event weight**: All major events (accident, brother's death, wife's cancer, taking in Yuting) have plausible mechanisms
- [x] **Paragraph coherence**: Each paragraph has one theme
- [x] **Chronology markers**: No redundant year+age; no hedging dates
- [x] **Vague language**: None found
- [x] **Abstract claims**: "meaner about small frustrations" now concrete
- [x] **Historical grounding**: Material culture, politics (martial law, democratization, COVID), and religion all appropriate for 1967-2025 Taiwan
- [x] **Jargon/naming**: No pseudosociological jargon; Chinese names have good variety (only 1/11 CVCV)
- [x] **AI-slop**: Simile removed
- [x] **Length**: ~1,950 words, appropriate for living adult

### Notes

Strong narrative with well-integrated personality traits. The very low neuroticism is shown through his flat affect during crises (accident, wife's illness) without being labeled. The substance use disorder threads through his life without dominating it. The family dynamics with siblings are clear and consistent. The childless marriage, taking in Yuting, and elder caregiving create a coherent arc of unexpected responsibilities falling to someone with low conscientiousness but high agreeableness. Good historical grounding in martial law era Taiwan and subsequent democratization. Minor note: debug data lists family as "waishengren" (Mainlander) but narrative presents them as typical benshengren (local Taiwanese) speaking Hokkien; the narrative is internally consistent.

## 0190-unnamed-infant.md

**Reviewed:** 2026-01-21

**Summary:** Unnamed infant boy born and died March 9, 1201 AD in Mithila region (modern Bihar, India). Died within hours of birth from birth asphyxia/obstructed labor. Sixth of ten children in a land-poor tenant cultivator family living in a joint household.

### Issues Found

**Household Composition (1 issue fixed):**
1. Uncle Bhola and aunt Phūlanī were missing from household description despite debug data indicating joint/extended household

**Final Read (2 issues fixed):**
1. "Rāmā, already a grown man" - incorrect for a 12-year-old
2. "lay in the ground since 1192" - awkward phrasing

### Changes Made

1. Added Bhola and Phūlanī to household description: "Keshava's brother Bhola and his wife Phūlanī shared the same courtyard"
2. Changed Rāmā's description from "already a grown man who handled ploughing teams and bargaining with landlords" to "twelve years old and already working the ploughing teams"
3. Changed "Sītā, the first, lay in the ground since 1192" to "Sītā, the first, had died at four and been buried in 1192"

### Review Checklist

- [x] **Family structure**: Joint household fully described (grandparents Dīnarāyaṇa/Jasodā, parents Keshava/Sundarī, uncle Bhola/aunt Phūlanī, siblings Sītā deceased, Mallikā deceased, Rāmā/Gaurī/Mādhava living)
- [x] **Chronology**: Timeline consistent (prior deaths 1192 and 1199, birth and death March 9, 1201)
- [x] **Trait visibility**: N/A for infant
- [x] **AI-slop**: Prose is direct and plain, no figurative language
- [x] **Naming**: Names appropriate for 13th-century Mithila region (Sanskrit/Maithili names)
- [x] **Length**: ~280 words, appropriate for infant (guideline 150-300)
- [x] **Historical context**: Good grounding in Mithila region, Eastern Indo-Aryan speech, village headman/revenue collection structure, Hindu infant burial practices (river)

### Notes

Clean infant narrative with appropriate historical and cultural detail. The birth asphyxia and death are handled with restraint. Previous infant losses (Sītā, Mallikā) contextualize this death as part of a household pattern. The midwife Nirmalā and Brahmin Deva Miśra both fulfill their expected roles. The funeral practice (body given to river) is appropriate for Hindu infant death. Only issues were minor: missing household members and an age discrepancy for one sibling.

## 0199-yama.md

**Reviewed:** 2026-01-21

**Summary:** Hunter-gatherer woman born 6806 BC in what is now Hunan, China. Fourth child, dies at 38 from childbirth/postpartum hemorrhage. Very high extraversion (98th percentile), very high agreeableness (100th), very high neuroticism (100th), very short stature (2nd percentile height). Childhood abuse by father during lean seasons. Physical assault at age 27 during inter-camp dispute. Four children (one dies in infancy, one stillborn at her death).

### Issues Found

**Name variety (12→5 CVCV pattern):**
All 12 names in the story followed the CVCV (consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel) pattern, making them sound repetitive and artificially generated.

### Changes Made

| Original | Changed to | Pattern |
|----------|------------|---------|
| Kiri (healer) | Kirran | CVCCVC |
| Hanu (father) | Ont | VCC |
| Kenu (brother) | Kett | CVCC |
| Lina (friend) | Oba | VCV |
| Senu (partner) | Sennu | CVCCV |
| Tala (daughter) | Tall | CVCC |
| Tomi (son) | Tommu | CVCCV |
| Mina (daughter) | Minn | CVCC |
| Nari (stillborn) | Narr | CVCC |
| Pira (assailant) | Pirr | CVCC |

Names kept as CVCV: Yama (protagonist), Ruma (mother) - 2/12 = 17% CVCV retained

### Review Checklist

- [x] **Family structure**: All family deaths covered (father Ont mid-narrative, mother Ruma age 27, daughter Tall age 2, stillborn Narr at Yama's death). Surviving children Tommu and Minn present; brother Kett survives her.
- [x] **Chronology**: Timeline consistent with narrative plan - abuse ages 4-9, pair-bond age 16, first child age 18, assault age 27, mother's death age 27, father's death age 33, death at 38
- [x] **Trait visibility**: Very high extraversion (greeting visitors, organizing, voice carrying); very high agreeableness (taking blame, giving away shares); very high neuroticism (hypervigilance, waking to check children, flinching at voices); very short stature (explicitly shown as "very small child—short-legged, easily knocked sideways")
- [x] **AI-slop**: No figurative language or personification found
- [x] **Naming**: Names now have phonetic variety; 2/12 CVCV pattern vs 12/12 originally
- [x] **Length**: ~1,950 words, appropriate for adult who lived to 38

### Notes

Strong narrative with well-integrated personality traits shown through concrete actions. The childhood abuse sequence effectively explains her adult hypervigilance and people-pleasing without being gratuitous. The physical assault at the inter-camp meeting is well-motivated by resource competition. The death scene handles the stillbirth and hemorrhage with appropriate directness. Good cultural details about forager life (seasonal moves, shamanic healing, inter-camp diplomacy). Only issue was the repetitive naming pattern.

## 0167-iorwase.md

**Reviewed:** 2026-01-21

**Summary:** 19th-century Tiv man from Benue valley, Nigeria. Subsistence farmer who becomes a locally prominent figure through medicine-making and dispute arbitration. Very high extraversion (88th), very high agreeableness (86th), low honesty-humility (20th), low openness (23rd), tall (83rd height), attractive (87th), homosexual orientation. Married to one woman, five children. Dies at 81 from cardiovascular event.

### Issues Found

**Missing trait visibility (3 issues fixed):**
1. Height (83rd percentile - quite tall) was not shown anywhere in the narrative
2. Attractiveness (87th percentile - quite handsome) was not shown anywhere in the narrative
3. Sexual orientation (homosexual) - the narrative plan specified "emotional distance at times due to Iorwase's concealed same-sex interests" in the marriage, but this was not reflected in the narrative

### Changes Made

1. Added physical description showing height and attractiveness: "Iorwase grew tall and was noticed for it. By the time he was fully grown he stood above most men in the compound. His face was broad and pleasant, and women looked at him when he passed, though he rarely held their eyes."
2. Added passage showing emotional distance in marriage (addressing concealed homosexual orientation without anachronistic labeling): "The marriage was practical. Iorwase was warm with visitors and easy with male companions, but with Mbaor he kept a certain distance that neither of them named. She bore his children and managed his household, and he provided, but there was no tenderness between them when the day's work was done."

### Review Checklist

- [x] **Family structure**: All family deaths covered (9 siblings: Terfa 1879, Mbayange 1856, Kwaghdoo infant, Mnger infant, Aondohemba infant, Iortyom 1902, Orkpe/Shagher survive him; parents: Terdoo 1888, Mnguhemba 1898; wife: Mbaor 1910; child: Iorkyaa 1878; uncle: Gbaahemba 1892)
- [x] **Chronology**: Timeline consistent with narrative plan, all dates verified
- [x] **Trait visibility**: Extraversion (speaking first, teasing, laughing), agreeableness (accepting compensation, framing disputes as restoration), low honesty-humility (sharp bargaining), low openness (resisting colonial changes), height and attractiveness (now shown), sexual orientation (now addressed through marital distance)
- [x] **AI-slop**: Prose is clean and direct, no figurative language issues
- [x] **Naming**: Names appropriate for Tiv-speaking people (Ior- prefix, -hemba suffixes); Mr. Hart plausible for colonial interpreter
- [x] **Length**: ~2,100 words, appropriate for elder (81) with many structured incidents

### Notes

Strong narrative overall with excellent historical grounding in 19th-century Tiv society. The life events are well-paced across the long lifespan: childhood loss of siblings, young adulthood marriage and children, midlife conflicts (theft, assault, perpetrating assault), later prominence as medicine man and arbitrator, colonial encounter, widowerhood, and death. The detail about protective medicines and the bundle of dead children's cloths is evocative. The structured incidents (property crime, assault victim, assault perpetrator, major achievement, chronic illness) are all naturally integrated. Minor additions needed for physical attributes and marital dynamics.

## 0165-veko.md

**Reviewed:** 2026-01-21

**Summary:** Forest Nenets man born 1897 in West Siberian taiga. Hunter-trapper and trade intermediary with basic Russian literacy. Dies by suicide at 41 in 1939 after cumulative grief (parents' deaths, child losses) and strain. High agreeableness (86th), high honesty-humility (85th), low neuroticism (34th), tall (87th height), lower intelligence (29th), bisexual.

### Issues Found

**Figurative Language (2 instances fixed):**
1. "He entered the world after loss" - euphemistic
2. "The camp work tightened" - figurative

### Changes Made

1. Line 449: "He entered the world after loss" -> "He was born after loss"
2. Line 469: "The camp work tightened" -> "The work fell harder on those who remained"

### Review Checklist

- [x] **Family structure**: All family deaths covered (5 infant/child siblings: Yarko 1896, Savo 1901, Toko 1903, Peko 1908, Nado 1912; sister Mando 1920 age 16; Uncle Old Neko 1931; son Miko 1927 age 6; infant son Yando 1928; father Haryo 1937; mother Lempo 1938)
- [x] **Chronology**: Timeline consistent with narrative plan, all dates match
- [x] **Trait visibility**: High agreeableness shown through mediation and not retaliating to theft; high honesty-humility shown in confronting theft honestly; low neuroticism shown through calm under pressure; height shown explicitly; lower intelligence shown through literacy struggles and reliance on helpers
- [x] **AI-slop**: Two figurative phrases fixed
- [x] **Naming**: Names appropriate for Forest Nenets (Veko, Nyanya, Haryo, Lempo, etc.) and Russian contacts (Pavel, Stepan, Daniil, Yevdokiya)
- [x] **Length**: ~2,000 words, appropriate for adult who lived to 41

### Notes

Excellent narrative with strong historical grounding in the Forest Nenets context and Russian Civil War era. The suicide is handled with restraint and dignity. The story effectively shows how cumulative losses (childhood sibling deaths, child deaths, parental deaths) wore down someone who appeared outwardly competent and stable. The bisexual orientation is appropriately left offstage per the narrative plan, as it "remains offstage and hidden, never displacing his marriage." The property crime (pelt theft) incident is well-integrated and shows his character through his honest response. The structured incidents (warfare impact, sick relative, elderly parents) are all naturally woven into the narrative.

## 0195-zhi.md

**Reviewed:** 2026-01-21

**Summary:** 5th-century BC farmer from Chu state (Hunan, China). Very low Openness (4th percentile), very high Conscientiousness (97th), very high Agreeableness (96th), low Honesty-Humility (10th), high attractiveness (93rd). Mild-moderate antisocial/narcissistic personality features. Married, five daughters (four die young). Dies at 55 from stroke.

### Issues Found

**Missing trait visibility (1 instance fixed):**
1. High attractiveness (93rd percentile) was not shown anywhere in the narrative—this is a "must be visible" trait.

### Changes Made

1. Added passage showing Zhi's physical attractiveness and how it affected his marriage negotiations: "Zhi had grown into a good-looking man—even features, strong shoulders, the kind of face that made women from visiting families glance twice. Hemu had used this when negotiating the match, and the terms had favored their household."

### Review Checklist

- [x] **Family structure**: All family deaths covered (grandfather Mao age 16, grandmother Qin age 19, father Hemu age 42, mother Yan age 47, brother Nuo infant, sisters Aru/Shao in midlife, children Jia/Biao/Danu/Kalu)
- [x] **Chronology**: Timeline consistent with narrative plan (marriage age 21, children's births/deaths, structured incidents at correct ages)
- [x] **Trait visibility**: Very low Openness (resists new methods), very high Conscientiousness (meticulous routines), very high Agreeableness (soft speech, gift-giving), low Honesty-Humility (tax evasion), high attractiveness (now shown), antisocial features (manipulation, controlling)
- [x] **AI-slop**: No figurative language or personification found
- [x] **Naming**: Single-character names appropriate for 5th-century BC Chu
- [x] **Length**: ~2,150 words, appropriate for an elder (55) with complex family and structured incidents

### Notes

Strong narrative with good integration of personality traits through concrete actions rather than labels. The tax evasion pattern with Zan effectively shows low honesty-humility while contrasting with his public agreeableness. The antisocial/narcissistic features manifest through controlling behavior and reputation management rather than overt cruelty. Child deaths handled matter-of-factly. The perpetrator property crime (under-reporting loads) and victim property crime (grain theft) are both well-integrated into the household's economic life.

1. "under the open sky" - slightly poetic phrasing

### Changes Made

1. Line 162: Removed "under the open sky" from final sentence

**Summary:** 12th-century Nahua man from central Mexico. Congenital epilepsy, very low intelligence (1st percentile), very low openness (5th percentile), very high honesty-humility (100th percentile). Dies at 40 from famine-related weakness.

**Figurative Language (3 instances fixed):**
1. "rain decided almost everything" - personification
2. "the compound felt colder" - figurative emotional coldness
3. "Hunger narrowed everything" - abstract figurative

### Changes Made

1. Line 374: "rain decided almost everything" -> "the harvest depended on the rains"
2. Line 384: "the compound felt colder" -> "no one in the compound spoke to him gently"
3. Line 402: "Hunger narrowed everything" -> "Everyone ate less"

### Review Checklist

- [x] **Family structure**: All family deaths covered (father pre-birth, mother 1220, 3 infant siblings, grandmother 1207, uncle 1228)
- [x] **Chronology**: Timeline consistent with narrative plan
- [x] **Trait visibility**: Epilepsy, low intelligence, low openness, high honesty-humility all clearly shown
- [x] **AI-slop**: Figurative language removed
- [x] **Naming**: Names appropriate for era/region
- [x] **Length**: ~1,750 words, appropriate for adult who lived to 40

### Notes

Strong narrative overall. Good integration of epilepsy throughout the story, showing how it affected his relationships and standing. The honesty-humility trait scene (returning overpayment to Tecpatl) is effective. The property crime (trespassing for wood) is well-motivated by famine and contrasts meaningfully with his high honesty-humility, showing how desperation overrode his principles.

## 0180-zi.md

**Reviewed:** 2026-01-21

**Summary:** Shang-period male infant born 1433 BC in Hunan, China. Dies at age 1 from respiratory infection. Second child in a garrison guard family; older sister died in infancy before his birth.

### Issues Found

**Figurative Language (1 instance fixed):**

## 0187-munyaneza.md

**Reviewed:** 2026-01-21

**Summary:** Infant male born September 3, 1818 in rural Rwanda (Kingdom of Rwanda). Dies at 2 days old from neonatal infection/sepsis. Fifth of eight children in a Hutu cultivator family; two older siblings died in infancy before his birth.

### Issues Found

**Living infant moment (1 instance fixed):**
1. Story moved directly from birth to illness to death without showing the baby alive. Added a brief moment of Munyaneza nursing and sleeping to make him a living presence before the loss.

### Changes Made

1. Added after "keeping the baby close to warmth and smoke": "He nursed that first night, small and warm against Rukundo's chest, and slept through the morning rain."

### Review Checklist

- [x] **Family structure**: Living siblings at birth correctly identified (Karemera age 10, Sebatware age 4). Two deceased infant siblings mentioned (Rwabukumba 1811, Nyirampuhwe 1813). Future siblings correctly omitted.
- [x] **Chronology**: Timeline consistent - born Sept 3, cord infection on day 2, died Sept 5
- [x] **Trait visibility**: N/A for infant

Solid infant narrative with good historical and cultural grounding. The burial ritual with sorghum beer and flour offering is authentic. The narrative appropriately shows the family's previous infant losses shaping their anxiety. Diviner-healer Rwitekerezo from narrative plan is included. The only improvement needed was adding a brief moment showing the baby alive before the infection.

## 0189-sena.md

**Reviewed:** 2026-01-21

**Summary:** 4th-century male toddler (age 2) from the Thar desert margin, modern-day Punjab/Pakistan. Fifth of seven children in a dependent herding family. Low agreeableness (26th percentile), low honesty-humility (18th percentile), low intelligence (24th percentile). Dies of fever March 8, 330 AD.

### Issues Found

**Missing content (2 issues fixed):**
1. Younger brother Vira (born 330, lives to 75) not mentioned - narrative plan specified he should be mentioned as "the brother who didn't grow" in family memory
2. Low intelligence trait not shown - plan specified "slower to follow multi-step requests; relies on pointing and fussing"

**Trait visibility (1 issue fixed):**
1. Low honesty-humility (18th percentile) not distinctly shown - plan described "trying to sneak a bite or grab a shiny bead when adults are distracted"

### Changes Made

1. Added multi-step request failure to show low intelligence: "When Gauri told him to come to her, then bring a cup, he stared and fussed; he could follow one request but not two in sequence."
2. Added sneaky grabbing behavior to show low honesty-humility: "When the adults looked away, he grabbed at food or reached for a bright bead Suma had set down."
3. Added closing paragraph about Vira's birth and Sena's place in family memory: "Later that year, Gauri gave birth to another boy, Vira. He lived to old age. In the household's memory, Sena became the brother who didn't grow."

### Review Checklist

- [x] **Family structure**: All family members now covered (parents Deva/Gauri, grandparents Bhoja/Nani, 6 siblings including deceased Dasi, deceased Lali, and surviving Vira)
- [x] **Chronology**: Timeline consistent with narrative plan
- [x] **Trait visibility**: Low agreeableness, low honesty-humility, low intelligence now all shown
- [x] **AI-slop**: Prose is direct and plain, no figurative language
- [x] **Naming**: Names appropriate for 4th-century Indo-Aryan region
- [x] **Length**: ~500 words, appropriate for toddler (2-4)

### Notes

Solid toddler narrative with good concrete details (goat interaction, protective thread, shrine-tree offerings). The developmental moments from the narrative plan (walking, first words) are well-integrated. Infant sister Lali's death adds appropriate historical realism about child mortality. Named characters Kala (herdsman) and Sodhi (healer) both appear as specified. The cause of death (fever/febrile illness) is handled with appropriate period practices (fumigation, warmed oil).

## 0169-gautier.md

**Reviewed:** 2026-01-21

**Summary:** 9th-century Frankish infant boy from rural Burgundy (West Francia). Died at 4 days old from neonatal infection/sepsis. Free smallholder family, Romance-speaking with Frankish identity.

### Issues Found

**Abstract Language (1 instance fixed):**
1. "steady with the newborn and strict about warmth and cleanliness" - abstract characterization rather than concrete action

### Changes Made

1. Replaced abstract description of Gisla with concrete actions: "wrapping the newborn in wool and checking that cloths were washed and dried"

### Review Checklist

- [x] **Family structure**: Parents (Ragenald, Adela), grandmother (Gisla), deceased sister (Ermentrude) all present; future brother Hildebert correctly omitted (born after death)
- [x] **Chronology**: Timeline consistent (born Oct 13, infected day 2, died Oct 17)
- [x] **Deaths coverage**: Ermentrude's 867 infant death mentioned appropriately
- [x] **Named characters**: All characters from plan present (Ragenald, Adela, Gisla, Father Anselm, Aldric)
- [x] **AI-slop**: No figurative language or AI-slop phrases found
- [x] **Naming**: Germanic/Frankish names appropriate for 9th-century West Francia
- [x] **Length**: ~300 words, appropriate for infant (0-1)

### Notes

Clean story with good historical grounding. The emergency baptism for a dying infant and church burial reflect 9th-century Christian practice accurately. The neonatal sepsis progression (umbilical infection on day 2, death on day 4) is medically plausible. The mention of older sister Ermentrude's death provides emotional context without being overwrought.

## 0193-aude.md

**Reviewed:** 2026-01-21

**Summary:** 13th-century French peasant woman from the Velay/Vivarais uplands (Haute-Loire). Very high agreeableness (85th), high honesty-humility (77th), very low conscientiousness (14th), very low physical attractiveness (5th). Married once to Bernat, 4 children (2 died in infancy, 1 at 40, 1 survived). Dies at 76 from age-related frailty.

### Issues Found

**Figurative Language (1 instance fixed):**
1. "Old age narrowed Aude's world" - abstract figurative language

### Changes Made

1. Line 363: "Old age narrowed Aude's world." -> "In old age Aude stayed close to the house."

### Review Checklist

- [x] **Family structure**: All family deaths covered
  - Parents: Raimon (d. 1268), Ermessenda (d. 1276)
  - Siblings: Azalaïs (d. 1253 at 25), Pons (d. 1241 at 7)
  - Children: Raimon (d. 1254 at 4), Pons (d. 1253 as infant), Bernat jr (d. 1296 at 40), Agnès survives
  - Husband Bernat survives her
- [x] **Chronology**: Timeline consistent with narrative plan; marriage 1248, births 1250-1260, deaths appropriately spaced
- [x] **Trait visibility**:
  - High agreeableness: mediating quarrels, quick peace offerings, giving extra yarn
  - High honesty-humility: insists on fair measures at market, uncomfortable with lying about wood-taking
  - Low conscientiousness: mending piles up, forgets promised barters, keeps accounts in her head
  - Low attractiveness: "treated as 'useful' rather than admired"
- [x] **AI-slop**: One instance of figurative language fixed
- [x] **Naming**: Names appropriate for medieval Occitan France (Raimon, Ermessenda, Azalaïs, Bernat, Agnès, Sibilla, Hugon, Guilhèm, Pèire)
- [x] **Length**: ~2,100 words, appropriate for elder who lived to 76
- [x] **Incidents**: Property theft (victim, age 34) and wood-taking (perpetrator, age 41) both well-integrated

### Notes

Excellent narrative with strong period detail. The Occitan/Velay setting is well-evoked with specific references to Latin Mass, market barter, and the Capetian administrative reach. The domestic violence scene (Bernat striking her) is handled matter-of-factly without melodrama, and the community response through Sibilla is realistic. The low conscientiousness trait creates good tension with the household management demands. The two structured incidents (theft and wood-taking) are both well-motivated and integrated into the broader economic pressures of the era. The three-generation household ending provides satisfying closure.

## 0163-rahma.md

**Reviewed:** 2026-01-21

**Summary:** Contemporary Tanzanian girl (b. 2016), still alive at age 9. Very high intelligence (97th percentile), very low openness (3rd percentile), low agreeableness (10th percentile), high extraversion (81st percentile), high conscientiousness (77th percentile), low honesty-humility (22nd percentile). Swahili coastal family in Dar es Salaam, affluent household.

### Issues Found

**Figurative Language (2 instances fixed):**
1. "Islam marked the calendar" - metaphorical
2. "sat on the edge of family decisions" - metaphorical

**Missing named character (1 instance fixed):**
1. Safiya (classmate/rival from narrative plan) not mentioned

### Changes Made

1. "Islam marked the calendar more than the daily schedule" → "Islamic holidays structured the year more than daily prayers"
2. "Bibi Zainabu sat on the edge of family decisions, correcting..." → "Bibi Zainabu corrected children's greetings and the angle of a headscarf, and voiced her opinions on household matters though they were not always followed."
3. Added Safiya as classmate/rival after the Mwalimu Rehema sentence, showing the academic competition and Rahma's bluntness damaging the friendship

### Review Checklist

- [x] **Family structure**: Parents, grandmother, household worker, siblings (including infant Yahya's death) all covered
- [x] **Chronology**: Timeline consistent (birth 2016, Amina 2019, Yahya 2021, dengue 2023, present 2026)
- [x] **Trait visibility**: All seven traits clearly demonstrated through specific scenes
- [x] **AI-slop**: Figurative language removed
- [x] **Naming**: Names appropriate for contemporary Swahili coastal Tanzania
- [x] **Length**: ~450 words, appropriate for still-living 9-year-old
- [x] **Historical context**: COVID-19, inflation/rising prices, urban development all mentioned
- [x] **Health incident**: Dengue fever covered with concrete details (Nurse Joyce, clinic, recovery)

### Notes

Strong narrative overall. Good integration of high intelligence with low agreeableness—Rahma's academic success and bluntness create a coherent character. The dengue fever incident is well-placed and leads naturally to the neuroticism trait (checking thermometer). The low honesty-humility trait (taking credit, exaggerating about chores) is subtly shown without making her unsympathetic. Imam Hamisi from the narrative plan was not included, which is appropriate given the family's low religious observance.

## 0200-kira.md

**Reviewed:** 2026-01-22

**Summary:** Female infant born July 25, 2108 BC in Gujarat, India (Harappan civilization sphere). Third of five children in a mother-centered household (father absent). Dies at 5 days old from birth complications/asphyxia. Older brother Juna died at 2 two years prior; older sister Tali (24) helps with labor.

### Issues Found

**Prose style (1 issue fixed):**
1. Opening sentence was dense and encyclopedic: "within the wider Harappan world of standardized pots, shell and stone ornaments, and village exchange with larger market towns"

**Living infant moment (1 issue fixed):**
1. "Kira lived five days, fed only a little, and died in Sani's arms" compressed her entire life into a single sentence. Per review guidelines, infant narratives should show the baby alive before the death.

### Changes Made

1. Split dense opening: Removed listy phrase about "wider Harappan world" and moved material culture reference to a separate sentence: "Pots and ornaments from larger market towns passed through the village by barter."
2. Expanded Kira's five days of life into a sequence: "Kira breathed, finally, but weakly. She nursed a little that first night and slept against Sani's chest. Over five days she took less and less milk. On the fifth morning she stopped breathing in Sani's arms."

### Review Checklist

- [x] **Family structure**: Mother Sani, absent father Kavi, grandmother Hali, midwife Vena, older sister Tali (24), deceased brother Juna all present. Future siblings correctly omitted.
- [x] **Chronology**: Timeline consistent (Tali 24 years older, Juna died 2110 BC)
- [x] **Trait visibility**: N/A for infant
- [x] **AI-slop**: No figurative language; one encyclopedic phrase simplified
- [x] **Naming**: Names appropriate for unrecoverable naming category (simple, pronounceable)
- [x] **Length**: ~290 words, appropriate for infant (guideline 150-300)
- [x] **Historical context**: Harappan material culture, burial practices (pit burial with grain and bead) appropriate for 2108 BC Gujarat

### Notes

Clean infant narrative with good cultural grounding. The birth complications and death are handled with appropriate directness. Previous child loss (Juna at age 2) contextualizes the family's anxiety and protective rites. The mother-centered household structure is well-established. Burial practice (pit at dwelling edge, grain and bead offering) reflects plausible regional practices. Only issues were minor prose improvements.

## 0207-toru.md

**Reviewed:** 2026-01-22

**Summary:** 5th-6th century man from central India (Madhya Pradesh), born 487 AD, died 526 AD at age 38 from respiratory infection. Fourth of four children in a mixed subsistence cultivator-forager family on the forest edge. Very low extraversion (7th percentile), very low openness (4th percentile), low agreeableness (19th), low conscientiousness (29th), low honesty-humility (14th), very high neuroticism (85th). Anxiety disorder (generalized anxiety/hypervigilance). Married to Hani (d. 519), one son Giru who died in infancy (513). Became a dependent lodger after wife's death; beaten in forest-edge dispute at 34; repeated petty theft victim in his 30s.

### Issues Found

**Missing Death (1 issue fixed):**
1. Mother Vena's death (520) was specified in the narrative plan but not mentioned in the narrative. The plan noted: "Relationship: Toru is attached to her and becomes more unstable and suspicious after her death."

### Changes Made

1. Added Vena's death after Hani's death: "Vena died the following year. She had grown weaker each monsoon, and that cool season her cough did not stop. Toru sat outside her door while Kora tended her. When it was over, he walked to the forest edge and stayed there until dark."

### Review Checklist

- [x] **Family structure**: All family deaths now covered
  - Parents: Dema (d. 515), Vena (d. 520)
  - Siblings: Kora (d. 523), Madi (survives him), Naka (d. 506)
  - Wife: Hani (d. 519)
  - Child: Giru (d. 513 in infancy)
- [x] **Chronology**: Timeline consistent with narrative plan (Naka 506, marriage 507, Giru 513, Dema 515, monsoon failure 517, Hani 519, Vena 520, assault 521, death 526)
- [x] **Trait visibility**:
  - Very low extraversion: short answers, avoids gatherings, leaves markets early
  - Very low openness: same paths/routines, resists new suggestions, "the old way"
  - Low agreeableness: arguments, grudges, snapping at siblings, shouting accusations
  - Low honesty-humility: shirking work, lying about hours, accusing others
  - Very high neuroticism: checking behaviors, hypervigilance, startling at sounds, breathless spells
  - Anxiety disorder: persistent throughout, worsens after losses
- [x] **AI-slop**: No figurative language, personification, or AI-slop phrases found
- [x] **Naming**: Names appropriate for non-Sanskritic forest-edge community (Dravidian influence); names have good variety
- [x] **Length**: ~1,950 words, appropriate for adult who lived to 38
- [x] **Named characters**: All from narrative plan present (Ravu, Pala, Soma, Kema)
- [x] **Structured incidents**: Property crime (recurring theft) and physical assault (521) both well-integrated

### Notes

Strong narrative with excellent character development. The anxiety disorder is shown through concrete behaviors (checking lashings, scanning paths, startling at sounds, breathless spells) rather than being named or explained. The decline from independent household to dependent lodger is well-paced and motivated by the accumulated losses and conflicts. The forest-edge setting is evocatively rendered with specific cultural details (tendu leaves, mahua flowers, fermented drink offerings, local spirits). The low personality traits (agreeableness, honesty-humility) create a coherent portrait of someone whose difficult personality contributed to his marginalization, while the anxiety disorder and accumulated grief provide sympathetic context. The only issue was the missing death of mother Vena, which has been corrected.

## 0218-kusum.md

**Reviewed:** 2026-01-22

**Summary:** Bengali infant girl born August 31, 1913 in Kanurampur village, Mymensingh District, Bengal (now Bangladesh). Died September 8, 1913 (8 days old) from birth asphyxia/complications. Sixth of six children in a joint household of tenant cultivators. One sibling (Gopal) died at age 3 before her birth.

### Issues Found

**Living Infant Moment (1 issue fixed):**
1. The story moved from difficult birth directly to "Kusum never fed strongly" and death without showing the baby alive. Added a passage showing her nursing weakly, sleeping against her mother, and being seen by sister Kamala.

**Idiomatic Phrasing (1 issue fixed):**
1. "kept the hearth going" - replaced with concrete actions

### Changes Made

1. Added living infant moment after the birth scene: "For the first two days Kusum took the breast, though weakly. She slept against Sushila's chest and opened her eyes when the courtyard grew loud. Kamala crept to the doorway to look at her. Then the feeding slowed."
2. Changed "Annapurna, sixteen, kept the hearth going when Sushila lay in confinement" → "Annapurna, sixteen, cooked and carried water when Sushila lay in confinement"

### Review Checklist

- [x] **Family structure**: All family members covered (father Madhab, mother Sushila, grandmother Bhagirathi, grandfather Narayani, siblings Haridas/Annapurna/Sukeshini/Kamala, deceased brother Gopal)
- [x] **Chronology**: Timeline consistent (birth Aug 31, death Sept 8, 1913)
- [x] **Deaths coverage**: Kusum's death and Gopal's prior death both covered
- [x] **Named characters**: All essential characters from plan present (Dasi Moyna the midwife included; Pandit Bholanath and Rahim Miah omitted as low-prominence optional characters)
- [x] **Living infant moment**: Now shows Kusum alive for two days before decline
- [x] **AI-slop**: No figurative language or personification
- [x] **Naming**: Names appropriate for early 20th-century Bengali Hindus
- [x] **Length**: ~320 words, appropriate for infant (guideline 150-300, slightly over but justified)
- [x] **Historical context**: Good grounding in British Raj Bengal, tenant cultivation, Hindu practices (Lakshmi worship, cremation rites)

### Notes

Clean infant narrative with good historical and cultural details. The joint household structure is well-established with clear roles for each family member. The difficult birth and subsequent failure to thrive are handled with appropriate directness. The mention of deceased brother Gopal provides context for the family's prior experience with child death. The cremation scene with rice and flower offerings is culturally appropriate for Hindu practice. The only significant issue was the missing moment showing the baby alive before her decline.

## 0215-parbati.md

**Reviewed:** 2026-01-22

**Summary:** 11th-century rural woman from a Munda-speaking tribal community near Kalpi, India. Born 1063, dies 1104 at age 40 from postpartum hemorrhage. Very high extraversion (93rd), very high agreeableness (93rd), very low openness (5th percentile), short stature (18th percentile height), homosexual orientation. Seven children (two die as newborns, one dies at 14 from chronic illness). Chronic recurring fevers, economic crisis from failed monsoons, takes in orphaned nephew, cares for elderly mother-in-law.

### Issues Found

**Missing trait visibility (2 issues fixed):**
1. Sexual orientation (homosexual) was not addressed anywhere in the narrative despite being marked in debug data
2. Short stature (18th percentile) was not shown

**Figurative Language (1 instance fixed):**
1. "Parbati's body had started to betray her" - metaphorical personification

### Changes Made

1. Added physical description showing short stature: "Parbati was short—her head came to his shoulder—but she moved quickly and carried loads without complaint."
2. Added passage showing emotional distance in marriage (addressing concealed homosexual orientation without anachronistic labeling): "The marriage was practical. Parbati was warm with other women and easy with visitors, but with Keshav she kept a certain distance that neither of them named. She bore his children and managed his household, and he provided, but there was little tenderness between them when the day's work was done."
3. Replaced figurative language: "By then Parbati's body had started to betray her in the rainy season. In 1086, with the first standing water in the low places and mosquitoes thick at dusk, the fevers began." → "By then Parbati had started falling sick each rainy season. In 1086, with the first standing water in the low places and mosquitoes thick at dusk, she woke shaking with chills."

### Review Checklist

- [x] **Family structure**: All family deaths covered
  - Parents: Hira (d. 1098), Suri (d. 1096)
  - Siblings: Kanha (d. 1060 as infant), Ganga (d. 1064 age 3), Madan (d. 1070 age 2), Chanda (d. 1070 as infant), Sona (d. 1074 age 2), Tulsi survives
  - Children: Nand (d. 1083 as newborn), Sita (d. 1089 as newborn), Bhima (d. 1101 age 14); Gauri, Harilal, Kamla, Madhav survive
  - Husband Keshav survives her
- [x] **Chronology**: Timeline consistent with narrative plan; marriage 1078, births 1079-1092, deaths appropriately spaced
- [x] **Trait visibility**:
  - Very high extraversion: "liked bustle," chose well at busiest hour, walked in middle of groups, talked easily
  - Very high agreeableness: smoothed quarrels, coaxed husband out of sulks, took in orphan without debate, soft voice correction
  - Very low openness: did things "the way her mother did," repeated same prayers, disliked being corrected
  - Short stature: now shown
  - Sexual orientation: now addressed through marital distance
- [x] **AI-slop**: Figurative language fixed
- [x] **Naming**: Names appropriate for 11th-century North Indian tribal community (Munda + Indo-Aryan bilingual context)
- [x] **Length**: ~2,250 words after edits, appropriate for adult who lived to 40 with many structured incidents

### Notes

Strong narrative with excellent integration of personality traits through concrete actions. The very high agreeableness manifests in multiple ways: taking blame, smoothing disputes, quick to apologize, taking in orphan. The very low openness shows through resistance to change and adherence to maternal traditions. The extraversion is shown through social patterns rather than abstract description. All structured incidents (chronic illness, economic crisis, sick child, orphaned nephew, elderly care) are naturally woven through the narrative. The death scene (postpartum hemorrhage) is handled with appropriate restraint. Good cultural grounding in 11th-century Gangetic plains: revenue measurers, village goddess shrines, bilateral bilingualism (Munda/Indo-Aryan). The only issues were missing trait visibility for height and sexual orientation.

## 0211-nikolaos.md

**Reviewed:** 2026-01-22

**Summary:** 6th-7th century Byzantine man from Paphlagonia (inland Anatolia, modern Turkey). Born 559 AD, died 624 AD at age 65 from stroke. Greek-speaking Chalcedonian Christian. Very high agreeableness (97th percentile), high neuroticism (85th), very low honesty-humility (10th), high extraversion (70th). Free peasant who lost independence and became an estate retainer after economic crisis. Married twice (Eirene d. 603, remarried Theodora 605). Six children (three died in infancy, one son Markos died at 27, two daughters survived).

### Issues Found

**Figurative Language (3 instances fixed):**
1. "a sharp laugh" - figurative
2. "War talk grew louder" - personification
3. "tightened every season into obligation" - figurative

**Naming Collision (1 issue fixed):**
1. Second wife and youngest daughter were both named "Helena" - confusing for readers. Renamed second wife to "Theodora" (appropriate Byzantine name).

### Changes Made

1. "Anna grew into a sturdy child with a sharp laugh" → "Anna grew into a sturdy child who laughed easily"
2. "War talk grew louder when Nikolaos reached his teens" → "Men spoke more about war when Nikolaos reached his teens"
3. "The arrangement kept his household fed, but it tightened every season into obligation" → "The arrangement kept his household fed, but each season brought more obligations"
4. Renamed second wife from "Helena" to "Theodora" throughout (5 occurrences)

### Review Checklist

- [x] **Family structure**: All family deaths covered
  - Parents: Theodoros (d. 586), Euphemia (d. 621)
  - Siblings: Georgios (d. 563 at 2), Anna (d. 571 at 8), Maria (d. 572 at birth), Eirene (d. 615 at 40)
  - First wife Eirene (d. 603)
  - Children: Theodoros (d. 585 at birth), Georgios (d. 588 at birth), Anna (d. 597 at 1), Markos (d. 617 at 27); Euphemia and Helena survive
- [x] **Chronology**: Timeline consistent from 559-624 with appropriate life phases covered
- [x] **Trait visibility**:
  - Very high agreeableness: "agreed quickly, then bargain in small steps," avoiding open quarrels, "smoothing disagreements with small concessions"
  - High neuroticism: checking children's breathing, sleeping lightly, waking at noises, watching for signs
  - Very low honesty-humility: skimming grain and oil, speaking piously about fairness in public while stealing, calculating warmth with orphan
  - High extraversion: enjoying talk with traders and collectors, sitting with friends, trading jokes
- [x] **AI-slop**: Three instances of figurative language removed
- [x] **Naming**: Names appropriate for 6th-century Byzantine Anatolia; collision resolved
- [x] **Length**: ~2,100 words, appropriate for elder who lived to 65
- [x] **Incidents**: All five structured incidents naturally integrated (economic crisis, property crime victim, property crime perpetrator, orphan adoption, elderly parent care)

### Notes

Strong narrative with excellent historical grounding in late antique Byzantine provincial life. The trajectory from free peasant to dependent retainer is well-motivated by the 592 crisis and creates a natural arc. The very low honesty-humility trait is shown through actions (skimming, hiding stores) contrasted with public piety, which is effective. The high agreeableness manifests as conflict avoidance and soft negotiation. Father Stephanos, Komēs Leon, Doros, and Aikaterine all appear with appropriate narrative roles. The death scene is handled with restraint. Only issues were minor figurative language and a naming collision between wife and daughter.

Arabic-speaking Sunni Muslim. Very high conscientiousness (98th percentile), very low extraversion (2nd), high neuroticism (69th), high agreeableness (87th), low honesty-humility (25th), low intelligence (19th).

Married to Fatimah (d. 1658). Eight children (two infant deaths, three died before him). Committed homicide in grazing dispute at age 28.

### Issues Found

**Missing Deaths (4 issues fixed):**
1. Brother Salih (d. 1640, age 48) not mentioned despite being eldest sibling and described in plan as "early model of adult responsibility" and "key mediator"
2. Brother Uthman (d. 1651, age 55) not mentioned despite being "the one who negotiates with patrons"
3. Brother Abdallah (d. 1661, age 63) not mentioned despite being "closest in age and the most constant companion in youth"
4. Daughter Maryam (d. 1646, age 20) not mentioned despite being first daughter

**Missing Trait Visibility (1 issue fixed):**
1. Height (87th percentile - quite tall) was not shown anywhere in the narrative

**Figurative Language (1 instance fixed):**
1. "obligations that tightened like a rope" - simile

**Prose Quality (1 issue fixed):**
1. "He did it with strict order" - unclear referent after Uthman's death sentence

### Changes Made

1. Added height to physical description: "He grew tall—taller than his brothers by the time he was fully grown—and was attractive..."
2. Added Salih's death and Maryam's death in 1640s paragraph: "His brother Salih, the eldest, died that same year at forty-eight; the household lost a mediator and a voice that had always spoken for caution. Maryam, the first daughter, died in 1646 of a fever that lasted a week."
3. Added Uthman's death: "Uthman died in 1651 at fifty-five; he had always been the one to bargain with patrons, and his absence forced Nasser to speak more in negotiations, though he did it badly."
4. Added Abdallah's death: "The following year Abdallah, the brother closest to him in age and his companion since childhood, died at sixty-three."
5. Replaced figurative language: "obligations that tightened like a rope" → "obligations that grew heavier each season"
6. Fixed unclear referent: "He did it with strict order" → "He compensated with strict order"

### Notes

Strong narrative with excellent integration of personality traits through concrete actions. The very high conscientiousness shows through relentless counting and checking without being labeled. The trauma-related disorder develops naturally from the witnessed violence in childhood and the homicide at 28, then worsens with bereavements. The homicide and subsequent diya settlement are handled matter-of-factly with good cultural grounding. The economic arc from dependent client to trusted manager is well-paced and tied to his conscientiousness. The main issues were missing sibling and child deaths—all significant family members who died during Nasser's lifetime are now accounted for. Good period detail throughout: Ottoman Hijazi administration, pastoral economy, patron-client relationships, Islamic funeral practices.

## 0239-erdeni.md

**Reviewed:** 2026-01-22

**Summary:** 17th-century Jurchen/Manchu man from the Sanjiang Plain (modern Heilongjiang, China). Born 1606, died 1657 at age 51 from acute respiratory infection. Mixed hunter-fisher-cultivator in a small community during the rise of the Later Jin and Qing conquest. Very low neuroticism (1st percentile), high conscientiousness (76th), low openness (23rd), moderate extraversion (56th). Depressive disorder (episodic). Married to Alun; one daughter Ejen who died in infancy. Involved in property crime (trespass trapping ages 28-34), physical assault perpetrator (age 31), physical assault victim (age 33), religious intensification (ages 39-42), chronic illness (ages 44-51).

### Issues Found

**Missing trait visibility (1 issue fixed):**
1. Low openness (23rd percentile) was not explicitly shown - narrative plan specified "skeptical of unfamiliar techniques or distant customs; prefers established seasonal routes and resists experimenting"

**Figurative Language (3 instances fixed):**
1. "Power in the region shifted" - abstract phrasing
2. "the heaviness stayed" - abstract/figurative description of depression
3. "The pressure on hunting grounds tightened" - personification/figurative

**Minor geographic issue (1 issue fixed):**
1. "east of the Songhua" - coordinates (46.31, 133.0) are in the Sanjiang Plain area near the Ussuri, not the Songhua

### Changes Made

1. Fixed geography: "in the mixed forests and river country east of the Songhua" → "in the mixed forests and river country of the Sanjiang Plain"
2. Removed abstract phrasing: "Power in the region shifted during his childhood as Nurhaci's Later Jin drew clans into new obligations" → "During his childhood, Nurhaci's Later Jin drew clans into new obligations"
3. Fixed figurative depression description: "the heaviness stayed" → "the slowness and the silence did not lift"
4. Fixed figurative language: "The pressure on hunting grounds tightened" → "Men argued more often about who could trap where"
5. Added passage showing low openness: "Some hunters tried new routes or traded with unfamiliar middlemen from farther south, but Erdeni kept to the paths his father had shown him. He trusted what he knew. When Mergen suggested a different approach to the winter camps, Erdeni refused. Only when the old ways failed entirely did he begin crossing lines that he understood well."

### Review Checklist

- [x] **Timeline**: All periods from 0-51 covered with appropriate density
- [x] **Household composition**: Birth household (parents Hūwangga/Aisin, siblings) and death household (elder-support with wife Alun, brother Mergen nearby) both clear

- [x] **Death audit**: All 6 family deaths covered
  - Paternal grandmother (d. 1614)
  - Sargan (d. 1603, remembered through offerings)
  - Bujantai (d. 1627 at 23)
  - Ejen (infant daughter, d. 1633)
  - Aisin (mother, d. 1648)
  - Hūwangga (father, d. 1652)
- [x] **Event weight**: All structured incidents well-integrated with plausible mechanisms
- [x] **Paragraph coherence**: Each paragraph has one theme
- [x] **Chronology markers**: Dates and ages consistent throughout
- [x] **Vague language**: None found
- [x] **Abstract claims**: None remaining after edits

- [x] **Jargon/naming**: Names appropriate for Jurchenic/Manchu context (Erdeni, Hūwangga, Aisin, Mergen, Alun)
- [x] **AI-slop**: Three instances of figurative language fixed
- [x] **Trait visibility**:
  - Very low neuroticism: calm during danger ("checked the lashings on the sled, packed the dried fish into hide bags, and waited for instructions"), calm response to being beaten
  - High conscientiousness: meticulous tool care, inventorying supplies, early repairs
  - Low openness: now shown through resistance to new routes and methods
  - Depressive disorder: shown through withdrawal, eating little, staring into fire, slowness
- [x] **Length**: ~2,650 words, appropriate for elder who lived to 51 with many structured incidents

### Notes

Excellent narrative overall with strong historical grounding in 17th-century Manchurian frontier life. The Later Jin/Qing context is well-integrated without being heavy-handed. The depressive disorder manifests naturally through behavioral descriptions rather than clinical language. The property crime arc (trespass trapping) is well-motivated by lean winters and leads naturally to the violence cluster. The religious intensification after the infant's death and accumulated grief is psychologically plausible. The very low neuroticism (1st percentile) is effectively shown through multiple crisis scenes where Erdeni remains calm and methodical. The main issues were minor figurative language and missing explicit demonstration of low openness, both now corrected.

1. Mubia (river landing trader/boatman) from narrative plan was not present despite being specified as prominent during raid period and post-separation landing incident

**Missing Trait Visibility (2 issues fixed):**
1. Very low openness (0th percentile) was shown in childhood but not demonstrated in adulthood—narrative plan specified refusing new methods during married life
2. Very high honesty-humility (92nd percentile) was not shown anywhere—narrative plan specified refusing to take from shared stores without permission

3. Added very low openness in marriage: "When Ndumba suggested a different way to prepare cassava or a different spot for planting, Nabale refused and did it the way Mangala had taught her. She would not try anything new. Ndumba called her stubborn; Nabale said nothing and kept to the old ways."
4. Added very high honesty-humility in post-separation: "When food was short, she would not take from shared stores without asking, even when others hinted she could. She returned a misplaced knife to a neighbor who had accused her of stealing it, though she could have kept it and no one would have known."

### Review Checklist

- [x] **Timeline**: All periods from 0-30 covered with appropriate density
- [x] **Household composition**: Extended kin compound at birth (parents Mokali/Mangala, grandmother Kondé, siblings); living alone/with non-kin at death

- [x] **Event weight**: All 8 structured incidents covered (sexual violence, domestic violence, physical assault, serious accident, extramarital sex, pregnancy outside marriage, civilian war exposure, witnessed atrocity)
- [x] **Paragraph coherence**: Each paragraph has one theme
- [x] **Chronology markers**: Dates consistent throughout; no hedging

  - Low intelligence: unable to follow complex kin-negotiation talk, relying on others to speak
- [x] **Length**: ~2,100 words, appropriate for adult who lived to 30

### Notes

Strong narrative with well-paced coverage of a difficult life. The domestic violence and sexual violence are handled matter-of-factly without melodrama. The trajectory from protected eldest daughter to marginalized separated woman is well-motivated through accumulated losses (children's deaths, father's death, marital breakdown). The raiding episode at age 16-17 is effectively rendered with the witnessed killing. The post-separation period shows resilience without romanticizing her circumstances. Good cultural grounding in 17th-century Congo basin river communities: lineage compounds, ancestor offerings, ritual specialists, river trade networks, inter-community raiding. The main issues were missing trait visibility for openness and honesty-humility in adulthood, the missing Mubia character, and figurative language that needed removal.
