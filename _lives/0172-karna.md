# ethnicity: Indo-Aryan agrarian (Middle Indo-Aryan/Hindi-belt plains culture, non-specific)
# father_occupation: Peasant farmer (cultivating family land or tenancy; grain/legume
#   cropping, household subsistence)
# historical_context:
# - event: Gurjara-Pratihara consolidation in north India (Kannauj-centered power) leading
#     to changing local overlords/retainers and periodic re-assessment of land revenue
#     and obligations collected through village intermediaries
#   timing: ages 0–28 (815–843), most noticeable in adulthood
# - event: One or more poor monsoon years causing regional crop shortfalls, seed scarcity,
#     and elevated grain prices (typical north Indian monsoon variability rather than
#     a single named famine)
#   timing: most likely ages 18–28
# - event: Endemic and periodically heightened malaria/fever seasons after monsoon (years
#     with heavier vector load leading to reduced labor availability and higher mortality
#     in villages)
#   timing: recurring annually; most impactful ages 10–28
# household_social_status: Ordinary peasant cultivators (smallholders or tenants with
#   modest security; not elite)
# household_structure_at_birth: 'Nuclear household: both parents present with children
#   only (no other close kin co-resident)'
# household_structure_at_death: Fraternal joint household without father (father deceased;
#   brothers co-resident with their wives/children)

#   local village speech)'
# literacy: Cannot read or write (functionally illiterate)

#   - birth_year: 817
#     death_age: 46
#     death_year: 863
#     name: Govinda
#     narrative_role: Younger brother; grows into a competent worker who often ‘covers’
#       Karna during fever bouts and after the leg injury. Their relationship mixes
#       loyalty with simmering resentment over Karna’s boundary-pushing.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 819
#     death_age: 85
#     death_year: 904
#     name: Radha
#     narrative_role: Much younger sister; remembers Karna vividly as charismatic and
#       sharp-tongued. She becomes the emotional link between Karna’s widow/children
#       and the brothers after his death.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Erodes trust with brother Nanda and neighbors; prompts elder-mediated
#       restitution and makes creditors harsher during the debt period.
#     scene: Karna quietly keeps back a portion of harvested grain to trade for personal
#       wants and later insists it was 'lost to rats,' then justifies edging the boundary
#       as what any man would do.
#     timing: Adolescence through adulthood (ages 14–28)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (very low)
#   - consequence: Reputation as quarrelsome; increases household strain and makes cooperative
#       labor exchanges harder to secure in bad years.
#     scene: At the irrigation turn-taking, he curses and shoves another cultivator’s
#       son, escalating a minor dispute into a village-elder hearing.
#     timing: Later childhood onward, especially ages 12–26
#     trait: Agreeableness (very low)
#   - consequence: Lower yields and more dependence on brothers; amplifies the impact
#       of poor monsoon years and debt.
#     scene: He neglects maintenance of a bund and delays weeding until pushed, then
#       works in bursts; when sick, he uses illness as cover to avoid less desirable
#       tasks even on good days.
#     timing: Adolescence and adulthood (ages 15–28)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (low)
#   - consequence: Less adaptation during climatic stress; household remains tied to
#       traditional practices and local authority.
#     scene: He dismisses new seed or cultivation advice from a traveling trader/priest
#       as 'town talk' and prefers familiar methods and local sayings about weather
#       and omens.
#     timing: Adulthood (ages 20–28)
#     trait: Openness (low)
#   - consequence: Fewer durable alliances; scandals (affairs, disputes) have less social
#       buffering.
#     scene: He socializes at festivals and markets but is not a community-joiner; he
#       keeps a tight circle and tends toward private deals and secret meetings.
#     timing: Adolescence to adulthood (ages 16–28)
#     trait: Extraversion (somewhat low)
#   - consequence: More quarrels at home; decisions skew toward immediate relief (borrowing,
#       petty encroachment) over long-term repair.
#     scene: During fever spells and debt months, he becomes short-tempered and fatalistic
#       rather than openly anxious; moods swing with bodily health and food security.
#     timing: Adulthood (ages 19–28)
#     trait: Neuroticism (mid)
# number_of_children: '8'
# number_of_siblings: '8'
# occupation: 'Cultivator/peasant farmer (primary work: plough agriculture on family

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During a drought-lean season he repeatedly shifted his plough line and irrigation
#     bunds a little into a neighbor’s strip and cut fodder from common-margin trees
#     at night, claiming it was ‘waste land’ when challenged. The dispute was handled
#     by village elders with warnings and small restitution in grain rather than any
#     state court.
#   reasoning: Petty theft, boundary encroachment, illicit grazing/woodcutting, cheating
#     in measures, and tax/dues evasion were widespread; his extremely low honesty-humility
#     makes at least one such act fairly likely.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Recurring pattern, ages 22–26
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime
# - event: After one failed monsoon and a poor rabi yield, his household ran short of
#     seed grain and took a high-interest loan from a local moneylender/merchant to
#     pay dues and keep oxen fed; they had to mortgage part of their tenancy rights
#     and work extra days for others to service the debt. The family’s diet narrowed
#     to thin gruel and wild greens for weeks at a time.
#   reasoning: Peasant households were highly exposed to harvest failure, debt to local
#     creditors, and livestock loss; remaining 'ordinary but secure' suggests crises
#     were not constant, but at least one severe episode was plausible.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Sustained period, ages 23–25
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: He developed recurrent fever bouts with chills and exhaustion that returned
#     every few weeks, especially after the rains, leaving him weak during peak fieldwork
#     and forcing his brothers to cover his turns behind the plough. Between attacks
#     he worked, but with reduced stamina and frequent headaches.
#   reasoning: Endemic infections (e.g., recurrent fevers/malaria), chronic parasitic
#     burden, and poorly healed conditions could create long-running limitation, though
#     many died before chronic disease was clearly established.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Sustained/recurrent illness, ages 19–28
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: A badly infected cut on his lower leg from fieldwork (sickle/thorn) healed
#     slowly and left a persistent limp and stiffness, making long days walking the
#     bunds and carrying loads painful. He could still farm, but he avoided some tasks
#     and relied more on younger kin for heavy hauling.
#   reasoning: Permanent disability (loss of an eye, bad limp from fracture, significant
#     hearing loss) occurred but was less common than recovery; surviving to marry/farm
#     suggests not totally incapacitated.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Single event with lasting effects, age 21 onward
#   type: acquired_disability
# - event: In his late teens, before his marriage negotiations were finalized, he had
#     secret sexual encounters with an unmarried girl from a nearby hamlet while meeting
#     at the edge of fields and during festival gatherings. The relationship ended when
#     her family arranged her marriage and rumors began to circulate.
#   reasoning: Many men had some premarital experience despite norms, especially if
#     marriage was not extremely early; this is the most common 'nonstandard' pattern
#     in such contexts.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Recurring pattern, ages 16–18
#   type: premarital_sex
# - event: After he was married, he had intermittent affairs—one with a married woman
#     from a neighboring household when their spouses were away at market or in the
#     fields, and another brief liaison during a pilgrimage-season visit to a larger
#     settlement. These were kept quiet but contributed to quarrels in his home once
#     suspicion arose.
#   reasoning: Affairs were constrained by surveillance and risk but did occur; his
#     low honesty-humility/agreeableness raises likelihood of opportunistic or coercive
#     infidelity.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Recurring pattern, ages 24–27
#   type: extramarital_sex

Karna was born in August 815 in a farming hamlet on the flat land between scrub and patches of moist deciduous forest, where the fields depended on the timing of the rains and shallow wells. The village answered to local men who collected dues in the name of larger powers that claimed the northern plains, and talk of Kannauj and the Gurjara-Pratihara kings came as rumor carried by traders. In Karna’s household, the prayers were simpler and closer: a small earthen lamp at dusk, a smear of cow dung on the threshold, and offerings of grain and milk to Shiva and to the village’s guarding spirit at a stone set under a neem.

His mother, Sita, had already buried too many babies. Before Karna, five daughters had been born and lost—Gauri and Uma in their first days, Lali within a week, and two others, Sona and Chanda, who lasted long enough to toddle and talk. The family did not speak their names often, but Sita kept a habit of placing a pinch of cooked rice at the edge of the courtyard before she fed the living children, then wiping her fingers on her sari and turning back to the cooking fire.

Karna grew between his older brother Nanda, born the year before him, and the children who came after: Govinda in 817 and Radha in 819. Their father Bhima worked a modest holding on tenancy terms, driving the oxen and bargaining with the village headman when assessments changed. Sita weeded and harvested with the women, carried water, and crushed grain on the quern. The household was nuclear then: Bhima, Sita, and their surviving children in one yard, with neighbors close enough that arguments carried through the mud walls.

As a boy Karna ran with other children along bunds and through stubble after harvest. He learned to keep goats out of sprouts and to throw stones at parakeets. He also learned early that he could take what he wanted if he took it quickly. When Sita sent him with a brass pot to the well, he drank first and let the water slosh out on the path, then swore the rope had slipped. He shoved other boys at the water point and laughed when they complained. Nanda grabbed him once by the wrist and twisted until Karna spat and promised to stop; the next day he did it again when Nanda was in the fields.

By ten he followed Bhima behind the plough, barefoot, guiding the oxen by voice and the flick of a switch. He liked the first cool hour after dawn, when he could sit on the bund with a lump of jaggery stolen from the storage jar and watch egrets in the wet patches. At midday he grew restless, avoided tedious weeding, and looked for an excuse to go to the village edge where the potter’s yard and the shade trees were. He traded jokes and insults there with Jata, a hired hand older than him, who could make Karna laugh by imitating the headman’s pompous walk.

In 833, when he was seventeen, Karna began meeting Malli from a nearby hamlet. It started at a fair day when traveling sellers set out bangles and salt and the villagers clustered around a storyteller. After that they found each other at the edge of the fields in the late afternoon, when women carried fodder and no one watched closely. They were careful until a cousin saw them vanish behind a stack of thorn branches. Talk moved fast through Rukmi, a woman who helped at births and carried news as easily as she carried water. Bhima reacted by pushing a marriage negotiation hard, offering grain and labor to Padma’s family to secure the match quickly.

Karna married Padma in 834. She came with a small chest of cloth, a brass plate, and the skills of a working household. In the first months Karna acted the husband in public, bringing a garland of marigolds to the village shrine and standing beside Padma during household offerings. In private he snapped when she corrected him or asked him to fetch water. He kept his own small hoard of grain and spent it on drinks during festival days—thin fermented liquor shared behind a wall with Jata and two other men, followed by dice on a cloth spread in the dust.

The same year his body began to fail him in a pattern the village understood. After the rains he shivered at night, then sweated and rose in the morning with a headache and a sour mouth. He pushed through it, but the fevers came back, leaving him weak during transplanting and harvest. Nanda took the oxen more often. Govinda carried loads that should have been Karna’s. Karna answered their looks with anger, then tried to cover it by boasting about how much he could do when he felt right.

Padma’s first baby, Hari, was born in 835 and died within days. Sita burned mustard seeds and waved smoke around the infant’s head, then placed a small offering of milk outside the door. Padma conceived again quickly. In 836 a son lived, and they named him Nanda after Karna’s elder brother, an attempt to bind the household together.

That same year Bhima died. A fever took him after a short illness, and the household changed shape overnight. Nanda became the man who spoke to Somadeva the village elder. The brothers kept the fields together, sharing seed and oxen, eating from one pot. Karna chafed at taking orders from a man only a year older. When Nanda assigned him to repair a bund, Karna delayed until the water broke through and flooded a corner of the field. Nanda slapped him hard in front of Govinda. Karna did not answer then; he waited until night and took extra grain from the storage jar, hiding it in a clay pot under the sleeping mat.

The rains turned uncertain in 836 and 837. Children kept coming and kept dying. Deva, born in 837, lived two years and died in 839 during a season of stomach sickness that swept the hamlet. In 838 a daughter, Gauri, died the day she was born. In 839 a son named Govinda died almost immediately, and in 840 another daughter, Radha, did the same. Padma's grief took practical forms: she cleaned the hearth again and again, and she insisted on offerings of sesame and rice at the neem tree, pressing Karna to pay the priest for a simple rite. Karna agreed, then spent the payment on drink and told her the priest had demanded less.

By 839 and 840 the monsoon had failed badly enough that seed grain ran short and fodder thinned. In 839 Karna cut his lower leg on a sickle in the fields. The wound swelled, oozed, and stank before it closed. When it healed it left him stiff and limping. Govinda took over long walks to distant plots. Karna sat more, chewing on a twig, glaring at anyone who looked at his leg.

Debt followed. In 839, when Karna was twenty-four, Nanda and Somadeva arranged a loan from Lakha, a merchant who moved between market villages. The terms were hard: grain and coin repaid with heavy interest after the next harvest. Karna hated the bargaining and made it worse by calling Lakha a vulture to his face, then pretending it was a joke. The household ate thin gruel and wild greens in 840 and again in 841, saving anything decent for seed. Karna used the hardship as an excuse to take. He shifted the plough line a handspan into Bharat’s neighboring strip and rebuilt an irrigation bund to favor their side. At night he cut fodder from trees on the common margin, dragging branches home and claiming they had fallen. Bharat confronted him in the path. Karna shoved him and dared him to fight; Somadeva called an elders’ hearing instead. Karna paid restitution in grain and received warnings, then repeated the behavior when the next lean week came.

Padma finally had a daughter who lived in 841, Chanda. In 842 she bore a son, Bhima, who survived his first months. That same year Sita died. She had grown thin and slow through the debt years, and a fever took her before the harvest. The household felt emptier without her quiet routines—the pinch of rice at the courtyard edge, the early mornings at the quern.

By then Karna's fevers returned with each rainy season, and his limp never eased. He also took risks that threatened what little stability remained. In 839 he began an affair with Kesi, a married woman nearby. They met when her husband went to market or worked distant fields. In 841 Karna traveled with others toward a larger settlement during pilgrimage season; he returned with a brief, careless story and a new ease at lying. Padma confronted him once, slapping his chest. Karna laughed, then struck her back hard enough to leave a bruise. After that, quarrels became quieter, kept within the yard so Nanda would not intervene.

In early November 843, after the post-monsoon period, Karna fell ill with violent diarrhea and vomiting. He could not keep water down. Padma gave him thin rice water with salt and tried to cool him with damp cloth. He died on November 8, 843, in the joint household yard. The men carried his body to the cremation place outside the village, burned it on a wood pyre, and scattered the ashes near running water, with a small offering of rice balls and a lamp set on the ground.
