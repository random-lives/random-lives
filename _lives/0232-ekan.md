#     role: father
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Sela
#     narrative_role: Primary day-to-day caretaker; runs hearth and food processing

#       is vigilant and quick to respond to signs of sickness.
#     role: mother
#   developmental_moments:
#   - age: about 2 years
#     detail: Ekan insists on doing the same small task every morning—carrying a tiny
#       bundle of kindling to the hearth and placing it in a particular spot. If someone
#       moves it, he protests, puts it back, and only then relaxes. He chatters loudly
#       while doing it, wanting his mother to watch.
#     moment: ‘Helper’ routine at the hearth
#   - age: about 2 years 6–9 months
#     detail: When his father comes back from checking animals, Ekan runs out calling
#       and tries to ‘herd’ chickens or a small goat by waving a stick, laughing and
#       showing off. A sharp bleat or a flap too close to his face makes him freeze,
#       then cry hard and cling—after which he returns to the game as soon as he’s soothed.
#     moment: First ‘herd’ game and sudden fright

#   personality_manifestations:
#   - behavior: 'Likes fixed routines and ‘doing it right’: lines up pebbles or bits

#       to copy adult work rather than purely free play.'
#     trait: Very high conscientiousness (96th percentile)
#   - behavior: 'Noisy and attention-seeking: runs to greet returning adults, vocalizes
#       to be noticed, and pulls at sleeves to show what he’s holding or doing.'
#     trait: High extraversion (88th percentile)
#   - behavior: 'Strong reactions to discomfort and surprise: cries quickly when startled,
#       resists unfamiliar tastes, and needs reassurance after minor bumps or loud sounds.'
#     trait: High neuroticism (88th percentile)
#   - behavior: Grabs and refuses to share small valued items (a smooth stone, a scrap
#       of leather); may shove a child who gets too close, then looks back to see if
#       an adult noticed.
#     trait: Lower agreeableness (36th percentile)
#   - behavior: 'Tests boundaries: hides a favored object behind his back when asked
#       for it, or snatches something and acts innocent until confronted.'
#     trait: Low honesty-humility (7th percentile)
#   - behavior: Quick to learn simple cause-and-effect and words for tools/animals;
#       points insistently and uses short repeated phrases to get what he wants or to
#       label things he’s interested in.
#     trait: Above-average intelligence (74th percentile)
#   - behavior: 'Curious within familiar spaces: explores the yard and edges of the
#       work area, but hesitates at truly unfamiliar places (dark doorway, deep water,
#       dense brush) unless an adult leads.'

Ekan was born in a small farming settlement in the wooded hills above the Pannonian plain, where households lived under the customs archaeologists later grouped into the Central European Tumulus world. No writing marked his family's speech; they used an Indo-European vernacular. Authority sat close by: elders, lineages, and men who could gather others for seasonal work and rites. At planting time and harvest, the community met at a clearing with food, drink, and fire, asking for steady weather and healthy animals.

His father, Marwyn, worked mixed fields and stock. His mother, Sela, kept the hearth, ground grain, cooked, hauled water, and spun fiber when her hands were free. Ekan was the third child. The firstborn, a boy named Brost, had died soon after birth. Lina, a sister born two years before Ekan, died at three just months before he arrived. Her name stayed in the adults' talk when they checked a child's skin or wiped a mouth too quickly.

By two, Ekan ran between the house and the yard and wanted eyes on him. Each morning he carried a small bundle of kindling to the hearth and set it in the same spot. If Sela moved it, he yanked it back and put it straight, then chattered until she looked. He kept smooth stones in a row along a timber and shoved Vyn, a neighbor boy, away when Vyn reached for one.

When Marwyn came back from the animals, Ekan ran out calling and grabbed a stick to push chickens and a young goat toward the pen, laughing and looking over his shoulder for approval. A sudden flap or sharp bleat made him stiffen and wail, and he held tight to Sela's skirt before he tried again.

A younger brother, Trost, was born when Ekan was two. Three months later, in midsummer, Ekan drank water from a fouled spring and ate food that had turned. Diarrhea began and did not stop. He weakened over four days and died, aged three. His family wrapped him in linen and placed him in the community's burial ground with a small clay cup and a pinch of grain. At the next seasonal gathering, his name was spoken aloud over the fire.

**Review changelog:**

**Issues found:**
- [Pass 12] All names were CVCV pattern (Maro, Baro, Vano, Taro), making the story feel procedurally generated
- [Pass 8] "Soon after" Taro's birth was vague—needed specific timing
- [Pass 14] "He died at three" was abrupt; death scene lacked physical detail
- [Pass 14] "speaking his name into the fire" was slightly figurative
- [Pass 3] "same year Ekan arrived" for Lina's death could be clearer about timing

**Changes made:**
- Changed father's name from Maro to Marwyn (non-CVCV)
- Changed firstborn sibling from Baro to Brost (non-CVCV)
- Changed neighbor from Vano to Vyn (non-CVCV)
- Changed younger brother from Taro to Trost (non-CVCV)
- Changed "Soon after" to "Three months later" for specific timing
- Expanded death scene: added "from a fouled spring," "He weakened over four days," and "wrapped him in linen"
- Changed "speaking his name into the fire" to "his name was spoken aloud over the fire"
- Clarified Lina's death timing: "born two years before Ekan, died at three just months before he arrived"
- Minor: "Each year" → "At planting time and harvest" for specificity
