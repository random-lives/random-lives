# Era: Holocene
# Lifestyle: Rural
# Name: Asha
# Naming category: inferable
# Sex: F
# birth_order_position: 4
# cause_of_death: Maternal illness or severe postpartum hemorrhage leading to loss of
#   newborn care/feeding in first day
# ethnicity: Tibeto-Burman-speaking Himalayan hill/foothill communities (proto-Kiranti/Lepcha-related,
#   broadly)
# father_occupation: Mixed subsistence cultivator (smallholder farming/horticulture
#   plus livestock; primary livelihood)
# household_social_status: Ordinary free household (typical smallholder/forest-edge
#   cultivator; neither notably wealthy nor poor)
# household_structure_at_birth: Extended with wife's parent(s)/matrilocal or uxorilocal
#   arrangement (couple and children living with wife's kin)
# language: Tibeto-Burman (Himalayan-branch local vernaculars; primary home language)

#   significant regular activity

#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: 14
#     name: Luma
#     narrative_role: Mother in a matrilocal household; worked in farming/horticulture
#       and textile production. Suffered severe postpartum hemorrhage or acute maternal
#       illness at Asha's birth, likely dying the same day or within days; relationship
#       quality would have been warm but largely unrealized due to Asha's immediate
#       death.
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Timi
#     narrative_role: Father was a mixed subsistence cultivator living with his wife's
#       kin (uxorilocal). Present at the household but not the primary household anchor;
#       during the crisis he would have deferred to the wife's mother/elders and sought
#       ritual/medical help. Emotional bond with Asha would have been largely anticipatory
#       rather than lived.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Mina
#     narrative_role: Senior woman of the matrilocal household and likely key organizer
#       of birth practices, postpartum care, and emergency responses. After the mother’s
#       collapse, she would have directed the household and the mourning/ritual handling
#       of Asha; steady, authoritative presence.
#     role: maternal grandmother
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Juma
#     narrative_role: Elder male of the wife’s natal household; managed external relations
#       (land use, disputes, exchanges). In the birth emergency he may have been tasked
#       with summoning a healer/shaman or negotiating help; relationship with Asha is
#       indirect but he shaped the household’s security.
#     role: maternal grandfather
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Chimi
#     prominence: medium
#     relationship: local ritual healer/shaman (called during difficult birth)

#   - birth_year: -16
#     death_age: 24
#     death_year: 8
#     name: Tama
#     narrative_role: Eldest brother; by the time Asha was born he was a grown man with
#       adult responsibilities (field labor, herding, route errands). Likely protective
#       in a practical way rather than playmate; his early adult death later becomes
#       a remembered blow to the household's labor and standing.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: -10
#     death_age: 33
#     death_year: 23
#     name: Bima
#     narrative_role: Second brother; an adult at Asha's birth, often present in the
#       household economy and in dealings outside the homestead. Would have been part
#       of the immediate circle responding to the birth crisis; later his death in his
#       thirties reinforces the family's sense of fragility and loss.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: -20
#     death_age: 57
#     death_year: 37
#     name: Sumi
#     narrative_role: Older sister; substantially older than Asha and likely already
#       managing heavy domestic work (textiles, food processing, childcare support)
#       around the time of the birth. She would have been the most hands-on female helper
#       during and after delivery, and the keeper of the story of Asha's one-day life
#       across decades.
#     sex: F
# number_of_siblings: '3'

In the wet hill country north of the Ganges plain, small Tibeto-Burman villages sat in clearings cut from broadleaf forest. Headmen and lineage elders settled disputes and organized labor; tribute went to local chiefs, not distant kingdoms. Mina's household stood on a slope above a stream near Kurseong, with millet plots, a few pigs, and woven bamboo walls smoked dark by the hearth. Her daughter Luma had brought her husband Timi to live with her, and the work of planting and cloth-making stayed inside Mina's yard.

The household had already known loss. Sumi, born in 20 BC, had learned to spin and weave beside her mother and grandmother and kept the cooking pots moving. Tama, born in 16 BC, had died six years earlier, remembered in offerings at the hearth. Bima, born in 10 BC, carried loads, helped clear brush, and walked paths to exchange salt and grain with neighbors. When the fourth birth came in late spring of 14 AD, Sumi boiled water and laid out clean cloth strips. Mina sent Doki to fetch Chimi, a ritual healer, when Luma’s labor turned hard.

Asha was born on May 22. The cord was cut with a sharpened sliver of bamboo and tied with fiber. Blood kept pouring from Luma. Chimi pressed heated stones in cloth to Luma’s belly and muttered protective words to the house spirits and the dead. Timi held a lamp close while Mina packed herbs at the mouth and tried to force warm gruel between Luma’s lips.

Luma died before morning. With no milk and no strength left in the room for another fight, Asha died on May 23. Mina wrapped the infant in a scrap of woven cloth and placed her in a shallow grave at the edge of the clearing, with a pinch of rice and a smear of fat as an offering to the land spirit.

<!-- CHANGELOG
- 2026-01-20: Reviewed. Changed "No distant rulers collected dues" to "tribute went to local chiefs, not distant kingdoms" to avoid negative framing (describing what wasn't there). Otherwise no issues found - family structure correct, chronology consistent, prose clean.
