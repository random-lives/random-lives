#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Improves his reputation as reliable in crises, increasing informal
#       influence even when other traits cause problems.
#     scene: During a sudden storm and a child’s fever, To stays calm, jokes softly,
#       and methodically follows the healer’s instructions rather than panicking; others
#       take cues from his steadiness.
#     timing: Midlife (age ~30-40)
#     trait: Neuroticism (extremely low)
#   - consequence: Expands exchange and marriage ties; helps recover from conflicts
#       and replaces lost tools/food through relationships.
#     scene: At seasonal gatherings he is the one who greets newcomers, organizes a
#       communal hunt plan, and leads singing/dancing around the fire, moving between
#       kin clusters with ease.
#     timing: Adolescence through adulthood (age ~12-45)
#     trait: Extraversion (very high)
#   - consequence: Reduces risk of feud/violence; strengthens his 'good man to camp
#       with' reputation.
#     scene: After the blade theft he avoids escalation, proposes a shared search and
#       an offering at the spring rather than revenge, and later gives meat to the visiting
#       group to keep peace.
#     timing: Young adulthood (age ~18-25)
#     trait: Agreeableness (very high)
#   - consequence: Creates household friction and occasional shortages; spouse becomes
#       de facto organizer, while To compensates by hunting harder when motivated.
#     scene: He promises to repair darts and prepare hides but delays, wanders to socialize,
#       and leaves tasks half-finished until Seko or a sibling pushes him to complete
#       them.
#     timing: Young adulthood through midlife (age ~20-45)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (low)
#   - consequence: Improves adaptability and social bridging; also increases exposure
#       to intoxicants and novelty-seeking.
#     scene: He eagerly tries unfamiliar foods/processing methods from another camp,
#       listens to different origin stories, and experiments with new point styles rather
#       than insisting on tradition.
#     timing: Adolescence and young adulthood (age ~14-30)
#     trait: Openness (high)
#   - consequence: Minor credibility strains; typically repaired by his generosity and
#       warmth rather than collapsing into major conflict.
#     scene: He enjoys status from being the center of attention and occasionally exaggerates
#       a hunt story; he also tries to keep his intoxication episodes hidden to protect
#       reputation.
#     timing: Adulthood (age ~25-50)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (somewhat low)
#   - consequence: Limits technical specialization; pushes him toward social/coalitional
#       strengths and steady, practiced routines.
#     scene: He learns best by imitation and practice rather than abstract planning;
#       in unfamiliar terrain he relies on others’ navigation and can be slow at complex
#       toolstone problem-solving.
#     timing: Childhood through adulthood (age ~8-35, recurring)
#     trait: Intelligence (low-ish)
#   - consequence: Increases accident risk and household stress; contributes to cycles
#       of remorse, restitution through sharing meat, and spouse-led boundary setting.
#     scene: After successful hunts and especially after child deaths, he seeks stronger
#       fermented drink at gatherings, becomes intermittently unreliable the next morning,
#       and occasionally argues or neglects tasks before making amends.
#     timing: Emerges in young adulthood (age ~22-30), worsens in midlife (age ~33-45),
#       fluctuates later (age ~45-57)
#     trait: Substance use disorder (problematic fermented drink/psychoactive plants)

# occupation: Generalist hunter-gatherer (mixed subsistence; hunting/trapping prominent
#   alongside gathering/fishing and camp tasks)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During a seasonal camp near a spring on the edge of their dry-forest home
#     range, someone from another visiting band slipped away with his best obsidian
#     blade and a finished dart point from beside his sleeping mat, leaving him to hunt
#     with poorer tools until replacements could be knapped or traded for.
#   reasoning: Even without formal property, theft of tools, food stores, hides, or

# - event: Before he formed his long-term pair-bond, he had consensual sex on several
#     occasions with a young woman from a nearby camp cluster during a shared late-season
#     gathering and dance, keeping the liaison quiet to avoid friction between families.
#   reasoning: In many forager societies, some premarital sexual activity occurred,
#     especially for socially active, extraverted individuals, even if partnerships
#     later formalized.
#   tier: 2

To was born in 3577 BC in the high country where dry forest broke into open patches of grass and thorn, near springs that held water through the hot months. No chiefs directed his people. Decisions came from talk and consent in a band that moved with seasons and with food. They belonged to an Archaic foraging tradition of the Michoacán highlands, spoke a local language that left no trace, and kept their ties through visits, marriages, and shared hunts with other small groups in nearby valleys.

His father knapped stone and hunted, and his mother gathered seeds and fruits, carried water, and kept the hearth. To’s first years passed in a tight camp: two parents, a few close kin nearby, and constant movement between shade and sun as they shifted shelters. When he was small, his mother taught him where to find edible pods and which plants stung. His father let him hold a dart shaft and feel the straightness with his fingers. At the hearth, they offered pinches of food into the coals and spoke to the places they depended on: the spring, a ridge, a stand of trees where game sometimes rested.

In 3573 BC his brother Men was born. Men grew into a steady child who copied adults without argument. In 3571 BC another brother arrived and died the same day. The adults carried the tiny body away from camp before sunrise. They set it in a shallow place in the ground and covered it with soil and stones. They left a small piece of ochre and a bit of food. To watched without crying. He kept looking at his mother’s hands instead, waiting for her to tell him what to do.

Two sisters followed: Nohi in 3569 BC, Kamari in 3567 BC, and Pala in 3565 BC. The camp grew louder. To liked it that way. When adults returned from gathering, he ran to meet them, asking questions and trying to take bundles from their backs. He learned quickly how to carry loads, but he forgot tasks and wandered off when someone started telling a long story. His mother sent him back for the water gourd more than once, and he came back laughing, making excuses, pointing out a lizard or a track as if that settled it.

By 3565 BC he walked long distances with the adults. He learned to read the ground for fresh deer sign, but he lost focus when the trail went cold. Men kept his eyes down and did not miss small details. To got bored and started talking. Men hissed at him to be quiet. To grinned and stayed quiet for a while, then started again.

Seasonal gatherings mattered. Once or twice a year their band met others at reliable water. Food and news spread. Young people danced in lines by firelight, stamping and clapping. To pulled others into it, teasing Men until Men finally joined. He liked the sound of many voices. He liked roasting agave hearts until the fibers softened, then chewing them while he talked.

In 3561 BC, when To was sixteen, he began slipping away with Kima, a young woman from a nearby camp cluster. They met behind a screen of brush at the edge of the gathering, then again after the dancing ended. They had sex more than once over that season, quick and quiet. In daylight they acted like cousins. To kept it from his sisters and from Men. Kima’s brother watched To closely, and To became careful about where he sat and who he joked with. He never showed fear. Even when confronted with a sharp question, he smiled and changed the subject.

By 3559 BC To hunted more and carried his own darts. He still left work half-done. A hide would lie scraped on one side while he went to talk with visiting men. His father scolded him and set the hide in front of him again. To worked fast for a while, then drifted.

In 3557 BC he camped with his band at a spring on the edge of their dry-forest range. Another band visited. There was trading talk and shared food. That night, someone crept near his sleeping place and took his best obsidian blade and a finished dart point. At dawn To reached for them and found only dust and a curled leaf. He stood up and called out without shouting, asking who had seen a person moving near the shelters. Men wanted to search packs and accuse. To stopped him. He walked to the spring, put a pinch of ground seed into the water, and spoke a short request for calm. Then he went back and borrowed a poorer blade. He hunted with it for days, cursing the dull edge under his breath, then laughed when the edge finally broke and he had an excuse to stop using it.

In 3549 BC To formed a long-term pair-bond with Seko. She had a quick eye for tasks and a hard patience for excuses. She liked To’s energy and his ease with others, and she took charge of what he forgot. Their first daughter was born in 3548 BC and died the same day. Seko wrapped the body and held it while To gathered stones for a small burial. He brought water from the spring and poured it on the ground beside the grave. He spoke to the place as if it could hear him.

Their second daughter came in 3546 BC. She lived. A third daughter was born in 3543 BC. In 3541 BC a son was born dead. To sat apart that evening, then got up and joined the singing as if forced by habit. At gatherings he began drinking more of the fermented drink some people brought, thick and sour. He sought it after long days, and he kept seeking it after losses. Once he woke late with his mouth dry and his head heavy, and Seko shoved a water gourd into his hands without speaking.

In 3538 BC a fourth daughter arrived. In 3536 BC a son followed. In 3534 BC their youngest daughter was born. To treated infants gently, holding them close to his chest. He played with children constantly, making them laugh by pretending to misplace a tool behind his back. He also failed them. He promised to repair darts and did not. He promised to watch a pot and let it scorch. Seko snapped at him, and he soothed her with soft talk and an extra share of meat when he brought something down.

In 3532 BC To fell during a hunt on rocky ground and injured his leg. He lay in camp for weeks, angry at himself, then bored. He tried to stand too early and nearly fell again. Men and Nohi brought him food. To joked even when sweat ran down his face from pain. He healed with a limp that faded but never vanished completely.

In 3530 BC sickness swept through the camps. The children coughed and vomited. Reme, an elder healer, mixed bitter herbs and sang over them. To carried his eight-year-old daughter on his back when she could not walk. He slept sitting up so the six-year-old boy could lean against him. Both children died that year. To drank heavily at the next gathering, despite Seko’s sharp look. One morning he staggered and snapped at Men over nothing. Within hours he apologized, bringing Men a share of roasted meat and insisting Men take the better piece.

In 3526 BC Men died at forty-seven. The band gathered stones and covered the grave. To spent that season helping Men’s household, bringing food and standing watch at night. He talked constantly to Men’s widow, keeping her from sitting alone for too long. He returned to Seko’s camp thinner and quieter for a time.

In 3522 BC To’s third daughter died at twenty-one. She had been strong and quick, already taking on adult work. Her death broke routines. To kept busy, helping Seko, cutting wood, fetching water, refusing to sit. At night he drank again, then stopped for stretches when Seko threatened to send him away from the hearth. He agreed, then failed, then tried again.

By 3520 BC To still hunted. He still wandered into other hearth circles to talk and laugh. He liked sitting on a flat rock above the spring at dawn, chewing roasted agave and listening for birds. That year an acute illness took him—days of diarrhea and fever that left him unable to travel. Reme gave him water and herbs, and Seko kept his mouth wet with a reed when he could not lift the gourd. On April 5, 3520 BC, To died in camp with Seko beside him and his surviving children close enough to hear the last instructions he managed to give about sharing his tools.
