Perkʷnā was born at the end of summer in 2184 BC in a high village above the forested valleys east of the Vardar basin. No king ruled there. Households answered to older men, negotiated with neighboring settlements, and kept exchange ties that carried copper tools and ornaments along the ridges. Her family spoke an early Indo-European dialect used across the central Balkans.

Her father, Swenāks, ran the household herds and fields. He walked out before dawn to check the goat pens and the cattle tethered near the edge of the clearing, then turned to the grain plots below the house. His father, Kléwos, lived under the same roof. Kléwos kept the stores and decided when to trade a calf or a skin for a small piece of metal. Perkʷnā’s mother, H₂elā, worked at the hearth. She ground grain on the stone, stirred pots, strained sour milk into a skin bag, and hung damp cloth on a line near the smoke hole. At night she set a pinch of meal and a sip of milk beside the hearth stones and touched Perkʷnā’s forehead with her fingers.

Perkʷnā cried often after feeding. When the first thin gruel replaced some of her mother’s milk, the stools turned watery. H₂elā boiled water in a clay pot and mixed it again, then carried the child outside for air and wiped her with rags rinsed in cold stream water. Perkʷnā’s belly cramped and she emptied herself again and again. On June 23, 2183 BC, she died in the house, on a bed of folded cloth beside the hearth.
