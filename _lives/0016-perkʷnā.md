Perkʷnā was born at the end of summer in 2184 BC in a small upland settlement in the forested hills where the valleys run toward the Vardar and Struma. No king ruled there. Households answered to older men, kin ties, and agreements made with neighboring villages, and they traded hides and animals downriver for stone, salt, and bits of metal. Her family spoke an early Indo-European tongue.

Her father, Deywos, held the household fields and led the herding. Their yard had sheep and goats, a few cattle, and racks for drying meat. He counted animals by touch in the dark and kept the best ewes separate before lambing. The family’s standing came from animals, stored grain, and the ability to gather people for work.

Perkʷnā’s mother, Alnā, worked close to the hearth. She ground grain on stone, boiled porridge, strained curds in cloth, and carried water uphill. When Perkʷnā cried, Alnā shifted her to the crook of an arm and kept turning the mash with the other hand. The baby slept on skins near the warm stones. Alnā rubbed fat on Perkʷnā’s legs when the nights cooled.

They lived with Deywos’s parents. The old woman kept a small place by the hearth for offerings: a pinch of meal, a sip of milk set down before the first taste.

In early summer of 2183 BC, Perkʷnā began passing thin stools. Alnā stopped giving her diluted goat milk and tried thin gruel and boiled water. The stools turned more frequent. Perkʷnā’s mouth dried and her crying thinned. She died on June 23, before the hay was cut.
