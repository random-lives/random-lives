# Age at death: 81
# Agreeableness (% rank): 98
# Birth date: March 28, 74061 BC
# Birth year: 74061 BC
# Climate now: Today the Middle Nile is hot and extremely arid outside the river corridor,
#   with agriculture and dense settlement concentrated along irrigated banks and floodplains.
#   Modern river flow and seasonal flooding are strongly altered by dams and water management,
#   but the surrounding landscape remains largely desert.
# Climate then: 'Around 74,000 years ago the region was in a colder, generally drier
#   glacial phase, so desert conditions likely pressed closer to the river than in wetter
#   periods. Even so, the Nile acted as a refuge: a dependable water source sustaining
#   a productive floodplain and wetlands, though floods and channels likely shifted
#   over time and the habitable strip could be quite narrow away from broader floodplain
#   pockets.'
# Conscientiousness (% rank): 70
# Cultural tradition: undifferentiated
# Death date: September 15, 73980 BC
# Environment: 'A narrow ribbon of perennial river, backwaters, and seasonally flooded
#   flats bordered quickly by dry steppe and desert. Riverbanks supported reeds and
#   other wetland plants, with gallery woodland in places, while the surrounding uplands
#   were mostly open, sparsely vegetated terrain. Resources were concentrated along
#   the water: fish, waterbirds, riparian plants, and grazing animals drawn to the floodplain.'

#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 35
#     connection: Occurs during Mira’s peak toolmaking years; the loss forces him to
#       rely on social skills (extraversion/agreeableness) to avoid escalation and try
#       to recover value via negotiation, shaping his later reputation as a mediator.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 48
#     connection: Happens after years of caregiving and loss; his temporary helplessness
#       becomes a reciprocal-care test—kin support reinforces his influential standing
#       and deepens his sense of obligation to care for others later.
#     incident: serious_accident
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-8
#     key_events:
#     - Learns river-edge routines (reed cutting, small fish gathering) under mother
#       Esi; strong attachment and early social play.
#     - Begins copying simple flake-making by watching father Haro and brother Koro.
#     - Father Haro dies (~age 8-9), creating first household reorganization and dependence
#       on siblings/uncle.
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 9-18
#     key_events:
#     - Mother Esi dies (~age 12-13); Sena becomes primary caregiver, and uncle Oru
#       trains Mira in male tasks and discipline.
#     - Adolescent Mira becomes conspicuously social—talkative at fires, quick to volunteer,
#       quick to soothe disputes—earning tolerance despite occasional boundary-pushing.
#     - 'Apprentices into toolmaking: selecting cores from river gravels, heat-treating/maintaining
#       edges, building a reputation for dependable cutting tools.'
#     phase: Later childhood & adolescence
#   - age_range: 19-35
#     key_events:
#     - Partnership with Lena begins (~age 21); Mira’s first stable household role and
#       increased obligations to in-laws; separation around age 26 after repeated tensions.
#     - Begins partnership with Asha (~age 28); multiple pregnancies; first two infants
#       (Rima, Suri) die at birth/soon after, shaping grief and household stress.
#     - 'Victim of property crime at a seasonal aggregation (ages 34-36): loss of prized
#       flint cores and a finished cutting tool damages his sense of fairness and triggers
#       a major mediation effort.'
#     phase: Young adulthood
#   - age_range: 36-60
#     key_events:
#     - Son Kebi born (age 34) then dies at 11; around the same time daughter Nari dies
#       at 3, creating a prolonged mourning period and increased caregiving for others’
#       children.
#     - Asha dies (around age 37); Mira repartnering with Deka (age ~39) stabilizes
#       alliances; he leans into public roles—organizing work parties, smoothing conflicts
#       over fish weirs/traps.
#     - 'Serious accident (ages 48-49): rib fracture from slipping by a backwater; weeks
#       of incapacity becomes a test of social support and his ability to accept dependence.'
#     phase: Midlife
#   - age_range: 61-81
#     key_events:
#     - Sister Nema dies (when Mira ~59), then eldest sister Sena dies (when Mira ~63);
#       Mira increasingly becomes a visible ‘steady voice’ in camp decisions.
#     - Brother Baku’s earlier death leaves unresolved obligations; Mira continues toolmaking/repair
#       work and mentoring adolescents, maintaining influence despite aging.
#     - 'Final years: recurrent gut illness episodes during harsh seasons; terminal
#       gastrointestinal infection/dehydration at age 81 after a bad water/food period.'

#       is a key grief point and pushes him into more public, supportive roles.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds broad alliances and information access; also makes him more
#       exposed to disputes and expectations to 'fix' social problems.
#     scene: At seasonal aggregations he is the first to greet arrivals, organizes shared
#       fish processing, and keeps conversations going late into the night, pulling
#       shy youths and tense adults into talk.
#     timing: Adolescence through late adulthood (esp. ages 15-70)
#     trait: Extraversion (100th percentile)
#   - consequence: Earns respected/influential standing; sometimes he is taken advantage
#       of, fueling private resentment.
#     scene: During quarrels over trap locations or meat shares, he offers face-saving
#       compromises and volunteers extra labor to make agreements stick.
#     timing: Young adulthood through old age (esp. after age 30)
#     trait: Agreeableness (98th percentile)
#   - consequence: Creates periodic reputation risk and motivates him to become skilled
#       at reconciliation; helps explain why the theft incident feels personally galling.
#     scene: He occasionally keeps the best flake blanks for himself or frames a trade
#       as 'even' when it favors his household, then uses charm and generosity later
#       to smooth over complaints.
#     timing: Young adulthood (ages 20-40) with reduced frequency later
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (27th percentile)
#   - consequence: Improves group safety at times, but also causes friction when others
#       see him as overly worried; contributes to rumination after the property theft.
#     scene: After his mother’s death and later after infant losses, he becomes vigilant
#       about signs of illness and water quality, sometimes waking others to move camp
#       or boil/avoid certain pools.
#     timing: Later childhood onward (ages 12-81), peaking after child deaths (mid-30s
#       to 40s)
#     trait: Neuroticism (70th percentile)
#   - consequence: Supports his toolmaker identity and makes others trust him with shared
#       gear and plans.
#     scene: He maintains toolkits meticulously—edge maintenance, core storage, and
#       teaching apprentices careful handling; he is dependable for scheduled tasks
#       like trap-check rotations.
#     timing: Adolescence through old age (ages 16-75)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (70th percentile)
#   - consequence: Increases practical success and social capital, contributing to ‘respected/influential’
#       status rather than merely being an elder.
#     scene: He anticipates flood shifts and chooses gravel bars for raw material; he
#       invents small improvements in hafting and edge angles suited to fish processing
#       and reed cutting.
#     timing: Young adulthood through later adulthood (ages 20-65)
#     trait: Intelligence (83rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Makes him a stabilizer and conservative planner; occasionally slows
#       uptake of potentially useful innovations.
#     scene: He prefers proven tool forms and familiar routes; he is cautious about
#       adopting novel practices proposed by outsiders, asking for demonstrations and
#       consensus first.
#     timing: All adult phases (ages 20-81)
#     trait: Openness (38th percentile)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During a seasonal aggregation on a higher bank above the floodplain, someone
#     from another camp quietly took his best flint cores and a finished cutting tool
#     he had been carrying in a skin wrap; when the loss was noticed, the items were
#     already traded onward with dried fish and no clear culprit could be proven.
#   reasoning: Even without formal property, theft of tools, meat, gathered foods, or
#     personal items is a recurring source of conflict in forager bands; high social
#     integration offers some protection but long exposure time raises risk.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 34–36
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: While checking fish traps along a reedy backwater at low light, he slipped
#     on a steep muddy bank and fell hard onto a partly buried log, breaking or badly
#     cracking ribs and leaving him short of breath and unable to travel or work for
#     many weeks while kin fed him and he slowly healed.
#   reasoning: Forager life around a big river and wetlands (boats/rafts, slippery banks,
#     night travel, large animals) creates real risk of falls, drowning-near-misses,
#     severe cuts, or fractures; surviving to 81 implies he likely recovered from at
#     least one major injury episode.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 48–49

Mira was born the youngest of six children in a camp that kept to the Middle Nile floodplain. People there lived in small shifting groups along the narrow green ribbon: reed beds, backwaters, fish runs, and the grazers that came in toward water. There were no chiefs with permanent authority. Decisions came from talk, from kin pressure, and from the few adults whose judgment others accepted. They marked the river’s dangerous places and the old camp grounds with small piles of stones and with remembered names.

His earliest world was his mother Esi’s hands, her routines. She cut reed stems for mats and carried bundles back above the damp edge. She showed him how to pull edible shoots from the wet mud and how to rinse grit from them in a shallow pan of bark. Mira followed his siblings everywhere. Sena, the eldest, treated him like another child she had to manage. Nema, closer in age, let him tag along when she checked snares for small animals in the gallery scrub.

His father Haro moved in and out of the camp’s daily circle. Haro fished and hunted along the river edge and returned with wet nets and the smell of smoke on his hair. He put stone in Mira’s hand early—flakes too sharp for play, meant for learning respect. When Mira was eight, Haro left before dawn with two other men and did not return that day. The others came back carrying only weapons and a torn strap. Haro’s body never reached camp. The household changed that week: more work for the older children, more watching of food, more listening to elders’ arguments about where to stay.

Esi kept the family together for four more years. Mira clung to her when strangers arrived at seasonal gatherings, and he learned which adults liked jokes and which answered with a hand raised for silence. He talked constantly, asking questions, repeating words, chanting names of birds. Some adults laughed and sent him on errands; others snapped at him. Esi’s death came when he was twelve. A fever took her fast. Afterward, Sena moved from being a sister to being the person who decided where Mira slept and when he ate. She did not tolerate sulking. She put work in his hands before dawn and pulled him into the firelight at night to listen, not interrupt.

Maternal uncle Oru took charge of the older boys in that period. He drilled them on small practical rules: how to step on brittle bank edges, how to carry a point so it did not cut someone, how to keep quiet when the group needed quiet. Mira followed these rules when Oru watched, and bent them when he thought he could win people back with smiles and favors. He gave away little things—choice bits of roasted fish skin, a smooth pebble, a reed whistle—then asked for something later and acted surprised when anyone resisted.

By fifteen he could make serviceable flakes. By eighteen he was choosing cobbles from gravel bars and striking them with controlled blows. He liked sitting slightly apart from the busiest part of camp, legs folded, the core braced, talking with anyone who came close. His hands moved while his mouth moved. He kept his best pieces wrapped in skin and tucked under his sleeping mat, and he checked the bundle every morning.

At twenty-one he began living with Lena. Their camps moved with her kin as much as with his. Mira liked the bustle of a larger household and the company during long tasks. Lena laughed easily and teased him about how he filled every silence. He answered with louder stories and exaggerated voices, making children squeal. The strain came from her brothers. They expected more blades and more repairs than he wanted to give. Mira argued with good humor in public and with sharpness when the fire burned low. He kept the best blanks for his own kit and pushed lesser flakes forward as “good enough.” The partnership ended when he was twenty-six; Lena walked back to her brothers after a fight about where to camp for the season’s fish run.

He did not stay alone long. At twenty-eight he joined with Asha, a woman whose family held good trap locations along a reedy backwater. Mira took pride in setting up a household that did not depend on Sena’s direction. He brought Asha tools with carefully retouched edges and took on the daily trap checks. Two daughters came quickly. Rima was born when Mira was twenty-nine and died the same day. Suri followed two years later and did not live past the first night. Asha did not shout or rage. She went silent and watched the water for long stretches. Mira filled the silence instead, trying to keep people close, calling children over, offering extra work, pulling others into talk. He also watched illness signs too closely. He demanded the drinking water be taken from a certain flow channel and not from a still pool. He woke Asha to move sleeping mats when the wind shifted.

Kebi, his son, was born when Mira was thirty-four. Mira carried the boy around the camp, showing him off, then disciplined himself to stay calm when others wanted to hold him. In that same year a large seasonal gathering formed on higher ground above the flood. People from other camps arrived with dried fish, bits of red ochre, and unfamiliar stone. Mira brought his best flint cores and a finished cutting tool, wrapped together in a skin roll he kept near his hip. One night the roll disappeared. He searched the sleeping areas and the ash piles where children hid things. By the morning the cores had moved through hands. Someone had traded them onward with strips of dried fish. No accusation stuck. Mira stood in the center of the gathering and spoke for a long time, naming obligations, naming the harm done, offering a path back for whoever had taken the bundle. The talk ended without return. He spent weeks afterward making do with poorer stone, irritated at every dull edge, then forcing his voice into friendliness so he did not lose allies.

Asha died when Mira was thirty-seven, after another hard season when sickness moved through the camps. Deka came into his life two years later, when he was thirty-nine. She was practical and quick to act. When Mira talked too long, she touched his arm once and he stopped. With Deka, his household steadied. He remained loud and social, but he learned to ask more questions before offering solutions.

Two deaths landed close together when he was in his mid-forties. Kebi fell ill and died at eleven, and Deka’s little daughter Nari died at three in the same season. After that, Mira’s camp always had other children underfoot. Some were close kin, some were attached by marriage. Mira took boys aside and taught them to strike flakes without shattering the core. He liked apprentices who listened. One, Tebo, stayed near him for years, sleeping within arm’s reach of Mira’s tool bundle.

When Mira was forty-eight, he checked fish traps at low light along a steep muddy bank. He slipped where the mud gave way, fell onto a partly buried log, and cracked ribs. The pain turned every breath into a decision. He could not travel with the group when they moved two days later. Deka and Safi, his closest fishing partner, arranged for a small shelter on higher ground with easy access to water. People brought him soup-thick fish broth and chewed plant mash. Mira hated being still. He talked at anyone who came near, then snapped at them for moving too slowly, then apologized and offered to trade a tool later. The ribs healed over weeks. He returned to work thinner, cautious on banks, and he insisted on safer steps when others hurried.

By late adulthood, his influence came from constancy. He kept records in his head: which channel had clean water after flood shifts, which gravel bar held workable stone, which families needed extra food after illness. He could be slippery in small exchanges—asking for the best cut of meat “for the children” and keeping it for his own household—but he repaired the damage by giving labor and attention where others would not. People tolerated the bargaining because he could settle shouting matches without humiliating anyone.

Death took his siblings one by one. Baku died when Mira was forty-three; the loss pulled Mira into long stretches of caring for Baku’s surviving kin. Nema died when Mira was fifty-nine. Sena lived into Mira’s sixties, and her death ended the last direct line to the household that raised him. Koro remained, old and sharp-eyed, and the two men argued softly over camp choices, then ate together.

Deka died when Mira was sixty-five. He continued living within the band, sleeping close to other households, always with someone nearby. In his final year he became careful about water again, wary of certain pools after a dry spell. Late in the hot season, he drank from a channel that looked clean but carried sickness. Diarrhea came hard and fast. He refused food, then begged for water, then could not keep it down. He died at eighty-one on a mat of woven reeds laid under a strip of gallery shade.

They carried him to a sandy rise above the flood line and covered him with earth and stones to keep scavengers out. Tebo placed Mira’s worn hammerstone beside the grave, and someone set a small lump of red ochre near his hands.
