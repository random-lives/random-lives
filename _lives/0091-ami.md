Ami was born at the end of the rainy season to a small inland band moving through the pine–oak highlands above the Pacific slope, where ridges held cool nights and the gullies carried water after storms. Her people spoke an early Uto-Aztecan tongue and lived without chiefs; decisions came from older kin and the pull of food and water. Her mother, Ona, kept a hearth near her own mother Sola and other maternal relatives. No man claimed a steady place beside Ona’s sleeping mat, and the household sat a little off the center of the camp’s exchanges of meat, stone, and favors.

Ona gathered in the morning with other women, digging roots with a pointed stick and cutting greens along the edge of the trees. She returned to camp to grind seeds on a flat stone, smoke clinging to her hair, and shifted Ami from hip to breast while she worked. When the band reached a spring, Ona sprinkled water on the ground before drinking and set a pinch of meal beside a stone, a short song under her breath for the place.

Ami cried sharply through her first cold nights, then settled. After the first moons, she began to track faces and quiet when Sola touched her cheek.

In her fourth month Ami woke one morning with a fever. By evening she had stopped nursing. She grew hot and unresponsive, then jerked and went still in Ona's arms.

Sola and Ona prepared the body and bound it in a hide. They placed Ami in a shallow grave above the camp, left a cake of ground seed beside her, and covered the spot with stones and pine needles.

<!--
CHANGELOG (2026-01-20):
- Expanded the sickness description from vague "a sickness came fast" to more concrete progression: "Ami woke one morning with a fever. By evening she had stopped nursing."
- No other issues found. Story has good plain prose, appropriate length for infant (~300 words), proper cultural/political orientation, named key characters (Ona, Sola), death clearly covered with burial description.
