#       and orphans later.
#     sex: M
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 16
#     connection: Occurs during inter-band visiting and night dances; her reserved temperament
#       means the relationship is quiet but persistent, setting up the later pregnancy
#       before formal co-residence.
#     incident: premarital_sex
#   - age: 18
#     connection: Direct consequence of premarital relationship; prompts negotiation
#       led by mother Pina and grandmother Kuna, resulting in a recognized shared-hearth
#       arrangement with Kari.
#     incident: pregnancy_outside_marriage
#   - age: 32
#     connection: Happens after three surviving births; increases her reliance on and
#       familiarity with curing rites and postpartum care, shaping her later competence
#       as a caregiver to orphans and elders.
#     incident: pregnancy_complications
#   - age: 36
#     connection: After relocation and camp fissioning, a close female relative dies
#       and the father is absent; Mara’s household takes in the children, dovetailing
#       with her craft role (making carriers/mats) and high agreeableness.
#     incident: orphaned_children
#   - age: 48
#     connection: Begins as mother Pina’s frailty emerges; later extends to an in-law
#       in the relocated camp, reinforcing Mara’s respected standing as reliable caretaker
#       and ritual participant.
#     incident: elderly_parents
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-7
#     key_events:
#     - Learns basic gathering and fiber handling by shadowing mother and older sisters
#       near streams and forest edges (c. 587-590).
#     - 'First major bereavement: oldest sister Sena dies after rainy-season fever (592).'
#     - Begins participating as a child helper during minor curing rites (smoke, blowing,
#       chanting) for common sickness in camp (c. 590-591).
#     phase: Early childhood in natal camp
#   - age_range: 8-17
#     key_events:
#     - Becomes notably careful and skilled at basketry and cordage; trusted to make
#       carrying frames and storage baskets (c. 596-600).
#     - Premarital relationship with Kari develops during visiting/dance gatherings;
#       quiet but persistent attachment rather than flamboyant courting (600-602).
#     - Second sister Luma becomes a young mother; Mara learns infant handling and postpartum
#       taboos by assisting her (c. 604-606).
#     phase: Later childhood and adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-33
#     key_events:
#     - First pregnancy occurs before fully formalized co-residence; older women negotiate
#       obligations and the couple begins to share a hearth (602-603).
#     - Births of first three children (604, 606, 609) with increasing competence and
#       respect for Mara’s craft and reliability.
#     - Luma dies at 30 (610), likely linked to childbirth illness/fever; Mara’s participation
#       in curing rites intensifies as helper and attentive caretaker.
#     - 'Pregnancy complication: miscarriage/stillbirth with hemorrhage and fever; weeks
#       of weakness and convalescence (615-617).'
#     phase: Early adulthood and family formation
#   - age_range: 34-45
#     key_events:
#     - Two infant deaths (616 and 618) during difficult seasons; Mara becomes especially
#       vigilant with newborn care and ritual protections.
#     - Significant long-distance relocation (>100-200 km) as tensions and camp fissioning
#       escalate; movement follows marriage/exchange ties and safety considerations
#       (c. 618-621).
#     - Union with Kari effectively ends amid relocation and factional splits (621).
#     - Father Toma dies (625), reducing natal-camp backing and pushing Mara to rely
#       on her own reputation and her older children.
#     phase: 'Midlife: losses, infant deaths, and major relocation'
#   - age_range: 46-60
#     key_events:
#     - Elderly-parent caregiving begins as mother Pina becomes frail; repeated fever/chest
#       sickness crises managed with practical nursing and ritual support (630-640).
#     - 'Mara is a stable camp figure: produces high-quality carrying baskets/mats traded
#       or gifted across visiting networks; teaches girls and younger women.'
#     - Forms late-life companionship with Aru after years of being treated as widowed;
#       household is stable but socially discussed (640-652).

#   - age_range: 61-68
#     key_events:
#     - Lives within a kin camp but co-resides with Aru; alternates between helping
#       with grandchildren and resting near the hearth.

#       illness worsens despite smoke/blowing cures and warmth.
#     - Dies July 652 at age 68; remembered for steady hands, soft speech, and the baskets
#       that outlasted her.
#     phase: Old age and death
#   other_named_characters:

#     prominence: especially ages 25-68, peaks during miscarriage episode (615-617)
#       and elder-care years (630-640)
#     relationship: female ritual-healing specialist (senior curer) in Mara’s relocated
#       camp; Mara is a frequent helper and organizer of materials
#   - name: Pori

#   - name: Nemi
#     prominence: ages 35-60, around fissioning/relocation and later governance
#     relationship: camp elder man who often mediates disputes; sometimes clashes with
#       Mara’s son Taki over travel risks
#   partners:
#   - name: Kari
#     narrative_role: First long-term partner (initially not fully co-resident); affectionate
#       but sometimes conflict-avoidant. He is the father of Mara’s first three children.
#       In the turmoil around band fissioning and Mara’s later relocation, he does not
#       remain with her camp; the union effectively ends.
#     relationship_end_year: 621
#     relationship_start_year: 600
#   - name: Aru
#     narrative_role: Late-life companion in the camp where she ends her life; socially
#       ambiguous because she is widely spoken of as widowed from Kari. Practical partnership
#       centered on shared hearth, mutual help, and protecting grandchildren; less romantic,
#       more caregiving and companionship.

#     name: Sena
#     narrative_role: Oldest sister; remembered as bold and quick, she pulled Mara into
#       childhood games and early gathering. Her death (fever after the rains) becomes
#       Mara’s first clear memory of loss and helps explain Mara’s later steady, careful
#       caretaking style.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: 580
#     death_age: 30
#     death_year: 610
#     name: Luma
#     narrative_role: Second sister and closest companion in adolescence; a skilled
#       gatherer who taught Mara basket patterns and how to watch people’s moods in
#       camp. Her death as a young adult (after childbirth sickness/fever) deepens Mara’s
#       attachment to extended-family cooperation and to curing rites.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Gains trust as a safe household to place vulnerable children and
#       elders; strengthens her reputation after leaving natal territory.
#     scene: She routinely de-escalates quarrels over food-sharing by offering her own
#       prepared portions first and speaking softly to both sides, then recruiting an
#       older man to mediate.
#     timing: midlife (ages 35-50), especially during relocation and fissioning
#     trait: Agreeableness (92nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Courtship is slow and private, contributing to the ‘not yet formal’
#       status of her early partnership and the premarital pregnancy.
#     scene: At night dances she stays at the edge, watching patterns and people; she
#       forms bonds one-on-one rather than through loud group display.
#     timing: adolescence into early adulthood (ages 14-25)
#     trait: Extraversion (23rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Her gear is sought after; she becomes indispensable during wet seasons
#       and caregiving periods (keeping elders dry/warm).
#     scene: She checks baskets for weak stitches, replaces frayed cord, and insists
#       on drying mats properly even when others are eager to move camp, preventing
#       losses in rain.
#     timing: throughout adulthood (ages 20-68)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (67th percentile)
#   - consequence: Improves household resilience and helps navigate relocation without
#       losing status; others consult her quietly for planning.
#     scene: She notices subtle shifts in fruiting timing and insect swarms and recommends
#       moving camp days earlier than usual; she also memorizes kin ties and uses them
#       to place fostered children with the safest relatives.
#     timing: early adulthood through later adulthood (ages 20-55)
#     trait: Intelligence (94th percentile)
#   - consequence: Stability and reliability are reinforced; she is viewed as dependable
#       rather than innovative.
#     scene: She prefers proven basket patterns and familiar foraging routes, resisting
#       experimental tool changes unless endorsed by elders.
#     timing: adult life (ages 20-60)
#     trait: Openness (35th percentile)
# number_of_children: '5'
# number_of_siblings: '2'
# occupation: Gatherer-craft specialist (notably basketry/fiber work/containers/mats/cordage)
#   alongside food work
# religion: Animistic/shamanic practice with frequent participation in healing/curing
#   rites (chanting, smoke/blowing, trance) as patient/helper; not the main shaman
# sibling_ages_at_death:
# - 16
# - 30
# sibling_sexes:
# - F
# - F
# structured_incidents:
# - event: During a period of camp fissioning and tension after her long-distance relocation,
#     a close female relative died and her partner did not remain with the band; she
#     and other women in her household took in and raised the orphaned child(ren), feeding
#     them gathered fruits/tubers and carrying them between seasonal forest camps until
#     they were old enough to forage and help with fiber work.
#   reasoning: Adult mortality could leave children without parents, and fostering by
#     kin was normal; however, with her own five births, taking on additional full-time
#     dependents is plausible but not the most typical main caregiving burden.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 34–42 (sustained period)
#   type: orphaned_children
# - event: One of her parents (and later an in-law) survived into frailty; she became
#     a primary helper—preparing soft foods, maintaining bedding and mats, keeping them
#     warm and dry in the rains, and arranging shaman-led blowing/smoking cures when
#     fevers or chest sickness returned.
#   reasoning: Because many adults died before reaching frail old age, not everyone
#     had living elderly parents to care for; still, her birth into an extended household
#     and her own longevity make it fairly plausible she cared for at least one aging
#     parent or in-law for a period.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 46–56 (sustained period with recurring crises)
#   type: elderly_parents
# - event: Before a publicly recognized co-resident partnership formed, she had a consensual
#     relationship with a young man during inter-band visiting and night dances; the
#     relationship was known to close kin but not yet treated as a settled marriage.
#   reasoning: In many forager contexts, sexual relationships could precede stable co-residence
#     or be part of courtship; with her high agreeableness and likely early partnering,
#     premarital sex is a common route to 'nonstandard' classification.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 16–18 (recurring pattern over several months)
#   type: premarital_sex
# - event: She conceived her first pregnancy before she and the father had fully established
#     a stable shared household; her mother and other senior women negotiated the relationship
#     and obligations, and the couple began co-residing only later as the pregnancy
#     became visible.
#   reasoning: If premarital sex occurred, pregnancy could precede formal recognition
#     of the union; however, long breastfeeding/spacing and social management of partnerships
#     reduce how often pregnancy clearly falls outside a recognized partnership.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 18–19 (single event)
#   type: pregnancy_outside_marriage
# - event: In a later pregnancy she experienced prolonged heavy bleeding and fever after
#     the fetus did not survive (a miscarriage or stillbirth); she was kept close to
#     the hearth, given warmed infusions and smoke/blowing treatments, and was weak
#     for weeks before recovering enough to resume gathering and basket-making.
#   reasoning: Across five live births (and likely additional pregnancies), miscarriage
#     and difficult labor are common base-rate events even when the mother survives;
#     the two infants who died at birth-year also suggest perinatal complications in
#     her reproductive history.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 31–33 (single major episode with weeks of recovery)
#   type: pregnancy_complications

Mara was born in the cool season of 584 in the forested uplands of what is now eastern Minas Gerais. Her band spoke a Macro-Jê language and moved between small camps in the Atlantic Forest, following fruiting trees, game trails, and the rains. They treated sickness and bad luck as problems in relations with animals, ancestors, and other unseen forces; curing meant heat, smoke, blowing, and chanting, carried out at the hearth with help from kin.

She grew up in an extended household. Her father, Toma, hunted and led people without raising his voice. When arguments flared over who had rights to a patch of palms or a fallen tree full of grubs, he sat between the quarrelers and made them name their kin ties out loud until they had to recognize who they were talking to. Her mother, Pina, gathered and made baskets. Pina’s hands were always busy: twisting fiber into cord, tightening a knot, checking a rim for weakness. Mara watched and copied.

Sena, the oldest sister, was already big enough to carry light bundles when Mara began walking. Sena liked to tease her, tapping Mara’s head with a rolled mat and calling her slow. Luma, the middle sister, had a steadier patience and showed Mara how to split fibers with a thumbnail and keep them even. Mara kept close to Luma, following her steps, never pushing to the center of the group.

When Mara was eight, in 592, Sena fell sick after heavy rains. The adults kept the fire high and brought smoke under the sleeping shelter. A healer blew tobacco smoke over Sena’s chest and rubbed her arms with warmed fat. Mara was used as a helper because she stayed still and did what she was told—fetching water, holding a gourd, keeping embers alive. Sena died anyway. Afterward Mara avoided the place where Sena had slept and chose her own sleeping spot farther from the edge of the shelter, closer to her mother’s mat.

By twelve she could make a carrying basket that did not collapse when it was loaded with nuts and wet tubers. She learned to check the stitching each morning, pressing the rim between her fingers and retying anything that shifted. She disliked wasted effort. When other girls left a damp mat rolled in a corner, she unrolled it and dried it in sun breaks, even if it earned a sharp comment. When the camp moved, her bundles were tight and balanced; nothing dragged.

At sixteen, in 600, Mara began slipping away at visiting gatherings with a young man named Kari. These gatherings brought several bands together near a broad stream, with night dances and drumming on hollow logs. Mara stayed at the edge of the circle, watching who crossed behind whom, who laughed too loudly, who turned away. Kari found her there. They met in the dim beyond the fires and returned before anyone had to ask where she had been. She spoke little, but she returned to him on the next night and the next season.

In 602, at eighteen, she became pregnant. She did not announce it. Pina noticed first, then Kuna, Mara’s grandmother, who still ruled the women’s work with a hard stare. Kuna and Pina spoke with Kari’s sister and then with Kari. The men talked with Toma. No one shouted. Kari began sleeping closer to Mara’s family hearth, and he brought more meat to Pina’s side of the sharing line. When Mara’s belly showed, the union was treated as settled.

Kuna died in 604, after a short illness that left her unable to stand. Mara mourned by working. She made a new mat for the older women and repaired the straps on a water carrier without being asked. Later that same year she gave birth to her first child, Oru. Labor took most of a day. The women kept her close to the hearth and rubbed her back with warmed hands. Oru lived, loud and strong.

Two years later, in 606, Mara had a daughter, Nara. Luma, then twenty-six, was a mother too, and the two sisters traded childcare without speaking much. When someone joked that Mara’s babies came out ready to watch and listen, Mara answered with a short smile and went back to scraping fibers for cord.

In 609 she bore another son, Taki. Kari carried Taki in a sling when Mara needed both hands for gathering, and he joked more than Mara did. Mara laughed at him when she was not tired; she had an abrupt laugh that ended quickly, as if she had cut it off.

Luma died in 610. She had given birth not long before, and fever returned and did not leave. Wina, an older curing specialist, was called. Wina sang into a gourd rattle and blew smoke along Luma’s spine. Mara held Luma’s wrists so she would not thrash. Luma’s skin cooled. After the body was carried out, Mara stayed near Wina for a long time, learning by watching: which leaves were crushed for washes, how embers were kept without flame, how the sick were repositioned to breathe.

In 616 Mara delivered a daughter, Mitu, who died in the first year of life, during the wet season when cough and diarrhea moved through the shelters. In 618 she had a son, Sapi, and he died soon after. After Sapi’s death, Mara stopped joining the loud teasing in camp. She still listened to stories at night, but she preferred to sit a little apart and keep her hands on fiber, twisting cord by touch in the dark.

That same year, 618, tensions grew between allied families. A hunting dispute turned into a fight over who owed meat and who had insulted whom. Toma tried to settle it, but younger men did not accept the old arrangements. In 619 Mara’s household left with a faction tied through marriage and exchange, walking for many days through forest and along ridges. They crossed into a different home range, more than two hundred kilometers from where Mara had been born. Kari did not remain with her. He returned to his kin after the first large camp meeting in the new area, and his visits stopped.

In the relocated camp, Mara rebuilt her place through work. She made carrying baskets that held their shape, and she showed younger women how to keep cord from fraying by rubbing it with fat. She avoided speeches. When disputes broke out, she offered food quietly to both sides and then went to Nemi, an older man who still had influence, and told him the points that mattered. Nemi listened to her because she did not exaggerate.

In 620 a woman named Pori—Kari’s sister by marriage tie, now part of Mara’s camp—died suddenly after a fever. The children she left behind were small enough to need carrying. The man who had fathered them did not stay with the group. Mara took them in with other women, from 620 until 626. She carried one on her hip while gathering and set the older one to strip bark fibers. She made small mats to keep them off damp ground. When they cried at night, she did not scold; she shifted them closer to warmth and waited until sleep returned.

Toma died in 625. News came by travelers. Mara kept her face still until she could be alone, then walked down to the stream and stayed there until dusk, sitting with her feet in cold water.

By 630 Pina had become frail and coughed often. Mara arranged for Pina to be kept dry in the rains, changing mats and moving the shelter wall so wind did not hit her. When fever came, Mara fetched Wina and sat through the long night cures, passing gourds and feeding embers, then giving Pina soft foods when she could swallow. Pina died in 636, having outlived both her daughters. Later an in-law in the relocated camp grew weak too, and Mara did the same work again without complaint. She found satisfaction in making a sleeping mat that stayed flat and in watching an elder eat without choking.

In 640, when Mara was fifty-six, she began sharing a hearth with Aru, an older man whose own family ties ran thin. People spoke of her as widowed from Kari and treated this union as an arrangement rather than a new marriage. Mara ignored the talk. Aru helped with firewood and stood between children and strangers during tense meetings. At night Mara liked roasted palm hearts and the thick grubs pulled from fallen trees; she ate them slowly, scraping the skin clean with her teeth. She liked early morning before others spoke, when she could check her baskets and retie straps.

In the cold-rain season of 652, she developed a hard cough and fever. Wina came, blew smoke and chanted, and Mara’s daughter Nara warmed stones and wrapped them in fiber to place by her feet. Aru kept the fire going. Mara still tried to sit up to drink, then stopped trying. She died on July 7, 652, in the shelter she shared with Aru.

Nara and the women of the camp washed her body and wrapped it in a woven mat. They placed a small basket of dried fruit and a coil of cord by her side and sang over her before carrying her to a grave in forest soil away from the sleeping shelters.
