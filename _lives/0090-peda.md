Peda was born on May 18, 458, in a small settlement in the dry deciduous forests of the uplands between the coastal plains of Kalinga and the larger river towns to the west. Tax collectors and armed men served distant rulers who spoke Prakrit and wrote in Sanskrit, but Peda’s family lived under a village headman and the rules of their own South-Central Dravidian–speaking community.

His father, Ranga, spent days in the forest cutting poles, setting snares, and collecting honey. His mother, Soma, kept the hearth, carried water, ground grain, and gathered greens and tubers. Their house held little beyond baskets, clay pots, a stone for grinding, and sleeping mats. Peda’s older sister Kanni, born in 454, fetched small bundles of firewood and watched the baby while Soma worked close by.

A trance-healer named Chenna visited the household often. Soma kept a small smear of red earth and rice paste on the wall-post near the sleeping place and set out leaf-cups with a few grains, salt, and a sip of beer at dusk, asking the village spirits and the ancestors to keep the children.

After the rains began, Peda’s body ran hot and he shook with fever. His gums paled and his belly swelled. Ranga brought bitter bark and forest leaves for decoctions; Chenna sang, drummed, and entered trance beside the hearth, then marked Peda with ash and tied a thread at his wrist. On October 9, 458, Peda died. Soma wrapped him in cloth and leaves; Ranga and Chenna placed the small bundle at the edge of the settlement near a tree used for offerings, leaving rice and a little honey.
