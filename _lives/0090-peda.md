Peda was born on May 18, 458, in a small settlement in the dry deciduous forests of the uplands between the coastal plains of Kalinga and the larger river towns to the west. Tax collectors and armed men served distant rulers who spoke Prakrit and wrote in Sanskrit, but Peda’s family lived under a village headman and the rules of their own South-Central Dravidian–speaking community.

His father, Ranga, spent days in the forest cutting poles, setting snares, and collecting honey. His mother, Soma, kept the hearth, carried water, pounded wild yams, and gathered greens and tubers. Peda's older sister Kanni, four years old, fetched small bundles of firewood and watched the baby while Soma worked close by.

A trance-healer named Chenna visited the household often. Soma kept a small smear of red earth and rice paste on the wall-post near the sleeping place and set out leaf-cups with a few grains, salt, and a sip of beer at dusk, asking the village spirits and the ancestors to keep the children.

In July, after the monsoon rains began, Peda's body ran hot and he shook with fever. His gums paled and his belly swelled. Soma tried cooling him with wet cloths and pressed wild ginger to his lips. Ranga returned from the forest with bitter bark for decoctions. Kanni crouched by the sleeping mat and watched her brother shake. When the fever did not break, Chenna came and sang through the night, drumming until he entered trance. He marked Peda with ash and tied a thread at his wrist.

On October 9, 458, Peda died. Soma wrapped him in cloth and leaves. That evening, Ranga and Chenna carried the small bundle to the edge of the settlement and placed it near a tree used for offerings, leaving wild rice and a sip of honey.

**Review changelog (2026-01-20):**

**Issues found:**
- [Pass 4] Kanni disappeared after introduction—never appeared during illness/death despite being described as the "earliest strong sibling bond" in the narrative plan
- [Pass 7] Final paragraph packed illness + multiple treatments + death + burial into one dense paragraph
- [Pass 9] "After the rains began" was vague timing for symptom onset
- [Pass 14] House contents list ("baskets, clay pots, a stone for grinding, and sleeping mats") felt formulaic
- [Pass 14] Healing sequence felt mechanical (list of actions)

**Changes made:**
- Added Kanni witnessing her brother's illness ("Kanni crouched by the sleeping mat and watched her brother shake")
- Split final paragraph into two: one for illness and treatment, one for death and burial
- Changed "After the rains began" to "In July, after the monsoon rains began" for precision
- Removed formulaic house contents list
- Changed "ground grain" to "pounded wild yams" to better fit hunter-gatherer lifestyle
- Expanded treatment details: added Soma's cooling attempts and wild ginger, made Chenna's trance session more vivid ("sang through the night, drumming until he entered trance")
- Changed "born in 454" to "four years old" (simpler, avoids date clutter)
