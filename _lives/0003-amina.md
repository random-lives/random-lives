Amina was born on May 27, 1064, in a mudbrick compound above the valley floor near Mahmud Raqi. After sunset the air dropped cold and the slopes around the houses showed only scattered scrub.

Her mother had entered the household through remarriage. Older kin controlled the stores and watched how much flour and oil left the jars. There were stepchildren in the rooms off the courtyard, and the new wife was expected to work first and speak last.

Amina’s father left at first light for other people’s building work. He mixed clay with chopped straw, carried bricks, patched walls, and cleared silt from channels when the water stopped running. Some days he came home with bread or a measure of grain, other days with nothing.

Her mother rose for the dawn prayer, then milked the goats and strained the milk into a skin to sour. She hauled water, fed the birds, and kept Amina wrapped against her side. On Fridays she stayed in the compound while the men went to the mosque. She kept the months by the thin new moon and by the fasting days, and she cooked what she could when Eid came.

Amina lived through the first weeks. As the heat eased, she grew thinner. In early November her stools became watery and frequent. Her mother boiled water, cooled it, and tried to give her small sips. She thinned gruel and pressed it to the baby’s lips. Amina vomited and cried until her voice failed.

On November 23, 1064, before the midday prayer, Amina stopped moving in her mother’s arms. The women washed her, wrapped her, and carried her out to be buried.
