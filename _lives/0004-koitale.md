# ethnicity: Nilotic or Maa-speaking pastoralist peoples (Maasai/related)
# father_occupation: Pastoralist herder/household livestock manager (cattle-centered
#   subsistence; grazing/water decisions)
# historical_context:
# - event: Expansion/intensification of Swahili-coastal and island merchant demand (Zanzibar/Pemba/Mombasa/Kilwa
#     networks), indirectly increasing the value of ivory, cattle, and captives in interior
#     exchange networks.
#   timing: throughout life (1670s–1690s)
# - event: Livestock disease episodes (e.g., contagious bovine illnesses and tick-borne
#     disease) causing notable cattle losses or reduced milk yield in some seasons.
#   timing: intermittent; likely once during ages 5–23
# - event: Regional raiding cycles and retaliatory conflict among pastoral and farming
#     communities, tied to cattle accumulation, bridewealth, and resource stress rather
#     than centralized war.
#   timing: peaking during late teens/early 20s (ages 15–23)
# - event: Food-price and subsistence stress from localized crop failures among neighboring
#     farming communities (drought/locusts), reducing grain availability for exchange
#     and increasing reliance on milk/meat or risky procurement.
#   timing: at least one season during ages 10–23
# - event: Endemic malaria and other febrile disease seasons (rainy-season spikes) affecting
#     labor capacity, mobility decisions, and mortality in the wider region even without
#     a single famous epidemic.
#   timing: recurrent annually; impacts likely multiple years (ages 0–23)
# household_social_status: Middle / ordinary pastoral household (moderate herd; socially
#   typical standing in the community)
# household_structure_at_birth: 'Polygynous homestead (manyatta): father with 2+ wives
#   in separate huts; child born to one wife; co-wives and many children nearby'

#   dairy processing; cooking; water/firewood; house maintenance)
# narrative_plan:
#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Sankale
#     narrative_role: Middle-status herd owner and household head in a polygynous enkang;
#       expects discipline and reliability with cattle. Relationship with Koitale is
#       strained by Koitale’s drinking and rule-bending but held together by kin loyalty
#       and pride in warrior service.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Naitoki
#     narrative_role: Household manager (milking, childcare, hut upkeep). Warm but easily

#       duties and wasted milk/beer exchanges.
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Naserian
#     narrative_role: Acts as steadying caregiver figure after Namunyak’s death, helping

#     death_year: 1691
#     name: Senteu
#     narrative_role: His only son, born from the premarital relationship; the infant’s
#       death becomes a quiet stigma and a private grief Koitale masks with bravado
#       and drink.
#     sex: M
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 16
#     connection: Begins regular patrol and escort work with age-mates; this network
#       later draws him into retaliatory action culminating in homicide and his own
#       death.
#     incident: military_service
#   - age: 18
#     connection: A raid on a settlement burns huts and drives off cattle; the resulting
#       shortages increase tensions, movements, and the frequency of patrols.
#     incident: civilian_war_exposure

#     connection: Occurs during the heightened insecurity after the settlement raid;
#       the injury and lingering pain contribute to heavier drinking and irritability.
#     incident: physical_assault
#   - age: 20
#     connection: A close male relative dies in violence in the continuing raiding cycle;
#       Koitale moves into a relative’s household to provide protection/herding support
#       for two young children.
#     incident: orphaned_children
#   - age: 21
#     connection: While moving between grazing and exchange points, he starts a relationship
#       with Naisula; inability to stabilize responsibilities/broaden bridewealth ties
#       intersects with caregiving burdens and drinking.
#     incident: premarital_sex
#   - age: 22
#     connection: A retaliatory raid linked to earlier losses and ongoing conflict;
#       killing happens at a water place during close fighting; afterward, he is simultaneously

#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 1664
#     name: Leperes
#     narrative_role: Another brief-lived brother; his absence contributes to Koitale

#   - birth_year: 1665
#     death_age: 10
#     death_year: 1675
#     name: Namunyak
#     narrative_role: A sister close enough in age to be his early playmate; her death
#       (fever/illness) becomes Koitale’s first remembered bereavement and feeds his
#       later anxiety and anger.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Missed duties and frayed trust with elders; impulsive fights; worsened
#       risk-taking on raids; contributes to unstable relationship with Naisula and
#       to why he remains unmarried.
#     scene: After patrol returns, he repeatedly seeks fermented drink before eating,
#       argues when refused, and shows up late to dawn cattle movements; later he drinks
#       to dull the old wound pain and to quiet nighttime startle and worry.
#     timing: emerges ages 15-16; escalates ages 18-23
#     trait: Alcohol-use disorder
#   - consequence: Irritability and quick escalation in conflicts; uses drink as self-medication;
#       difficulty sustaining steady courtship and household reliability.
#     scene: He is jumpy during rainy-season fevers and after raids—overreacting to
#       distant shouts, scanning the bush, and interpreting minor disputes as threats;
#       he ruminates on Namunyak’s death and later the infant’s death.
#     timing: notable after age 6; intensifies after ages 18-22
#     trait: High neuroticism (78th percentile)
#   - consequence: Creates quiet resentment among peers and suspicion among elders;
#       increases likelihood of retaliations and the need to prove himself through risky
#       bravery.
#     scene: He takes credit for others’ watchfulness on patrol, hides small mistakes
#       with livestock counts, and is willing to pocket a portion of exchanged goods
#       before reporting to elders; he rationalizes it as 'warrior’s due.'
#     timing: adolescence onward (ages 13-23)
#     trait: Very low honesty-humility (10th percentile)
#   - consequence: Gets assigned lower-trust tasks; increases conflict with father and
#       older sister; makes caregiving duties stressful and uneven.
#     scene: He procrastinates on repairing gear and neglects routine tasks (water containers,
#       tethering, rotating watch), then tries to improvise at the last moment, often
#       blaming bad luck or others.
#     timing: childhood chores (ages 9-12) into adulthood
#     trait: Low conscientiousness (22nd percentile)
#   - consequence: More easily manipulated in disputes; chooses simpler, force-based
#       solutions; contributes to remaining a follower rather than organizer/elder-in-training.
#     scene: He struggles with complex bargaining and remembering multi-party obligations
#       in cattle/grain exchanges, and misjudges risk in terrain and timing; relies
#       on more capable peers/sister for planning.
#     timing: visible in later childhood (ages 8-12) and adult exchanges
#     trait: Low intelligence (7th percentile)
#   - consequence: Builds broad peer ties useful for patrols and trade, but also increases
#       exposure to drinking settings and risky relationships.
#     scene: He is drawn to gatherings, storytelling, and cross-community contact; he
#       picks up multiple Bantu languages from exchange points and enjoys novelty, songs,
#       and new ways of doing things.
#     timing: ages 12-23
#     trait: Moderately high extraversion (62nd percentile) + openness (68th percentile)
# number_of_children: '1'
# number_of_siblings: '6'
# occupation: Young male pastoralist/warrior role (age-mate security, scouting, occasional
#   raiding; still tied to herding)
# religion: 'Maa pastoralist traditional practice: daily prayers/blessings to Enkai;
#   cattle-centered rites; age-set/elder rituals; rain/fertility/healing rites'

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During a cattle-raid skirmish between age-set groups, he was struck with
#     a club and cut by a spear point while trying to drive animals away from attackers;
#     he survived but carried lingering pain and a visible scar.
#   reasoning: Given his warrior/raiding milieu, alcohol-use disorder, and eventual
#     death from warfare/raid injury, involvement in fights/beatings/assault is extremely
#     likely.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 18–20 (single event)
#   type: physical_assault
# - event: On a retaliatory raid, he helped corner an armed opponent near a watering
#     place and killed him with a spear thrust in the close struggle, after which the
#     group withdrew with a small number of cattle.
#   reasoning: Participation in raids and lethal spear/club fighting makes having killed
#     someone plausible; however many warriors never personally kill, especially by
#     age 23.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: around age 22 (single event)
#   type: homicide
# - event: After a close kinsman (likely an elder brother or maternal cousin) died in
#     violence, he took responsibility for two young children in his relative’s household—guarding
#     them during movements, ensuring they were fed, and herding on their behalf—until
#     older kin reallocated care.
#   reasoning: He had one infant who died, and at 23 unmarried men are less often primary
#     adoptive parents; taking in a sibling’s child or close kin’s orphan is possible
#     but not the most typical scenario.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 20–23 (sustained period)
#   type: orphaned_children
# - event: He had a sexual relationship with an unmarried young woman from a nearby
#     community he met through grazing/trade contacts; she became pregnant, and the
#     baby boy died at birth or soon after, before any marriage or bridewealth was completed.
#   reasoning: Unmarried at death yet fathered a child strongly implies at least one
#     premarital sexual relationship.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 21–22 (recurring pattern over months)
#   type: premarital_sex
# - event: As part of his age-set’s warrior duties, he regularly joined patrols and
#     escort parties to protect herds, scout water and grazing, and respond to raid
#     alarms organized by elders and age-mates.
#   reasoning: He was in a warrior/scouting role; while not a state army, this functionally
#     serves as militia/warband duty for the community.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 16–23 (recurring pattern)
#   type: military_service
# - event: 'He experienced at least one raid on a settlement: cattle were driven off,
#     huts were burned, and people fled into the bush for safety before regrouping,
#     leaving the community short of milk and animals for months.'
#   reasoning: Even as a combatant, he likely also experienced raids affecting settlements
#     and herds, but full displacement/occupation-like exposure is less consistently
#     present.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: around ages 17–19 (single event)
#   type: civilian_war_exposure

Koitale was born on June 16, 1669, in the miombo woodland and open grasslands of the central plateau, inland from the Swahili coast. His people spoke Maa and measured wealth in cattle. Elders settled disputes, age-mates kept watch and raided, and traders moving between the coast and the interior made ivory and captives valuable, even far from the sea. Koitale grew up praying to Enkai with his family at their enkang: elders lifted their hands, spoke blessings for rain and calves, and flicked milk as an offering onto the ground near the gate.

His father, Sankale, kept a moderate herd and more than one wife, each with her own house inside the thorn fence. Koitale’s mother, Naitoki, ran her household tightly: she milked in the early light, strained milk into gourds, smeared the inside with smoke to keep it sweet, and set aside sour milk for times when grain ran short. She fetched water, gathered wood, kept children clean, and patched walls after heavy rain. Sankale expected boys to learn fast, and he used a stick when they did not.

Before Koitale, Naitoki had borne six children. Three sons died as infants—Nenkashe in 1656, Sadera in 1658, Lemaiyan in 1660. Then came a daughter, Naserian, in 1661, who survived. Another baby boy, Leperes, was born in 1664 and lived only a short time. Namunyak arrived in 1665 and lived long enough to talk and carry small bundles of firewood, then she died in 1675 after a sickness season. Koitale, the seventh and last child, was the only boy who lived past infancy. Naserian treated him like a small child long after he wanted it; she tied his sandals, corrected his Maa when he mixed in words he picked up from visitors, and slapped his hand away from the milk gourd when he drank too early.

As a small boy he stayed near the houses, watching calves and goats and shouting at dogs. He liked the hours after milking when the women talked and he could sit close enough to listen. He repeated stories badly and got details wrong, and older children laughed at him for it. He learned to laugh with them and to talk his way out of blame. When he broke a gourd, he claimed it had cracked already. When a calf slipped its tether, he said another boy untied it. His mother scolded him. His sister sighed, then fixed the mess.

Rainy seasons brought fever. Dry seasons brought long walks to wells. When Koitale was six, Namunyak died, and he stopped sleeping well. He startled at shouts from the cattle pen and ran outside with a club before anyone else was moving. Naitoki took him back into the house and pressed a hand on his chest until his breathing slowed. After that he stayed close to the gate at dusk and watched the bush line, even when others sat and ate.

By his early teens he moved with older boys to the grazing. He spoke Maa at home, but he also spoke in the tongues of neighboring cultivators, learned at exchange points where milk, hides, and iron moved for grain. He liked those days: noise, argument, small jokes, singing while waiting. He liked roasted meat when a goat was slaughtered and the first fat dripped, and he liked the quiet after, when men sat chewing and spitting and telling old raid stories. He also began to drink more than a boy should. Fermented honey drink and grain beer came out at gatherings. He drank fast, then lied about how much he had taken. When the adults turned away, he reached for the calabash again.

At sixteen, in 1685, Koitale entered the circle of young men who did patrol and escort work with their age-mates. They moved in groups, carrying spears and clubs, scanning for tracks near water, walking the edges of grazing. He enjoyed the closeness of it. Lepurko, an age-mate with a quick tongue, liked Koitale’s jokes when Koitale was sober. When Koitale was drunk, Lepurko shoved him hard and told him to keep his mouth shut.

Two years later, in 1687, raiders struck a settlement tied to Koitale's family. Huts burned. Cattle were driven off. People fled into the bush and waited until night, then regrouped to count losses. Afterward, milk was scarce. Women bargained harder for grain. Men slept with weapons close. Koitale joined more patrols, and he started drinking to sleep, not only to celebrate.

In 1688, a skirmish broke out during an attempted cattle theft at a watering place. Koitale ran with others to push the animals back toward the thorn fence. A club hit him on the shoulder. A spear point sliced his side as he turned. He did not fall, but blood soaked his leather and dust stuck to it. The cut healed. The scar stayed, and the pain returned when he carried loads or walked too long. He complained about it, then drank. When elders assigned him a morning duty, he arrived late and argued. Sankale faced him in the cattle pen and struck him with a switch, not hard enough to cripple him, hard enough to shame him in front of younger boys.

Koitale did not marry. He had no cattle of his own to offer and he wasted what he could have saved. He talked too much, promised too easily, and took offense fast. Still, he remained inside the circle of ordinary respect: he kept patrols, he showed up when alarms sounded, and he moved with the herds when the grazing shifted. When he crossed exchange paths with Mtemi, a Bantu-speaking guide, he tried to bargain on his own and miscounted what he owed. Mtemi laughed and corrected him, and Koitale pretended it had been a joke.

In 1689, a raid killed one of Naitoki's brothers, leaving two small children without a father. Their mother's family took them in, and Koitale went to stay at the household of Nkoluai, his maternal uncle, to help. The arrangement was spoken of as temporary. It stretched into years. Koitale walked with the children when the cattle moved, lifted one when the brush tore at the child’s feet, and shouted at older boys who tried to steal their food. He did not nurse them or bathe them; women did that. His work was protection, herding help, and the hard arguing when someone claimed a calf or a gourd did not belong to them. Naserian checked on the children and on Koitale, and she fought with him when he came back smelling of drink.

In 1690, at a grain-for-milk exchange, Koitale met Naisula, an unmarried young woman from the neighboring community. He returned to the same place twice more, and then he found reasons to pass near her settlement when his group moved grazing. They slept together before any bridewealth was offered. He spoke of cattle he did not have and boasted about raids he had not joined. When she asked for steady help, he brought small gifts—beads, a strip of hide, a piece of iron—then disappeared for weeks on patrol.

A boy, Senteu, was born in 1691 and died within hours. Koitale went to see the child, then went away. That night he drank until he could not stand. Lepurko held him up by the elbow, angry and still steadying him. Koitale picked a fight with a man who laughed at him and had to be dragged off before spears came out.

Later in 1691, on a retaliatory raid near a watering place, Koitale helped corner an armed opponent. The fight came close and fast. Koitale drove his spear into the man’s body and pulled it free, then ran with the others, pushing a small number of cattle ahead of them. Back at camp, elders spoke blessings, and Pajeshi, an older ritual authority, cleansed the group with milk and ash. Koitale did not sleep. He drank again, and he started at every sound beyond the thorn fence.

He stayed with Nkoluai's household into 1693, still helping with the orphaned children, still on patrols. On March 25, 1693, another raid turned into a running fight. Koitale took a wound from a spear and fell before his age-mates could pull him back behind cover. They carried his body to the edge of the settlement and laid it in the bush for scavengers, as was done for young men who died away from home. Elders spoke a short blessing to Enkai and poured a little milk onto the ground.
