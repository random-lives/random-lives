Nubia Stella Cárdenas Ospina was born on April 25, 1927, in Cali, in Colombia’s Cauca Valley. The city sat under a central government in Bogotá and under the local power of church, landowners, and party bosses, with everyday life shaped by Catholic practice and by the growing pull of wages from factories, rail yards, and the sugar economy. Nubia’s family was mestizo and Spanish-speaking. Their world was city streets, markets, and parish routines, not plantations or mountain hamlets.

She was the third child in a house with five children. Two sisters and two brothers. One brother died in infancy before she was old enough to remember him. Her father was gone from the household while she was small. Her mother, Leonor Ospina, kept the family together with sewing and laundry, and by taking on extra work that could be done at home while watching children. Leonor stored soap and cloth in a wooden trunk and kept a slate to track who owed what. She made sure each child could say their prayers and show up clean to church on feast days.

Nubia started school and learned her letters, but reading never came easily. She could recognize common words and sound out a short passage if she went slowly. Writing stayed rough. She learned to sign her name and copy what she needed. When she left school, she did not argue. She took on errands, minded younger children, and later helped her mother with washing. She learned to keep a schedule without a notebook, by repeating it out loud and tying small reminders to the routine of the day.

In the late 1940s, violence between Liberals and Conservatives spread through Colombia. In Cali, it was heard in talk, in the news read aloud in shops, and in arrivals from the countryside. New families crowded into rooms near the center and on the edge of town. Nubia watched Leonor bargain for rent and food with harder eyes than before. On Sundays, they still went to Mass. Nubia carried a small prayer card in her bag and kept a rosary tucked in a drawer.

She married in her early twenties. Her husband, Rafael Cifuentes, worked steady jobs when he could: loading, delivery, and later a position tied to a warehouse that served the growing city. They set up a home that was clean and plain, with a few framed images—Sacred Heart, the Virgin—and a calendar from a shopkeeper. Nubia cooked, fetched water when service failed, and took in extra washing when money tightened. She had five children, two boys and three girls. She kept their clothes mended and their school papers in a tin box. When a child got sick, she walked to the clinic and waited without leaving her place.

Cali changed around her. The city expanded fast with industry and services, and the sugar economy in the valley pulled people and money into the region. New buses ran routes that used to be long walks. New neighborhoods appeared with unpaved streets. Nubia found paid work outside her home as her children grew. She cleaned houses for better-off families, sometimes by the day, sometimes twice a week for the same employer. She scrubbed floors on her knees and carried buckets that left her hands red. She worked with a tight sense of order. A room got finished before she moved on. She did not leave a job half done.

In the late 1970s, when she was around fifty, she was robbed on the way home. She had her wages in her purse and a small packet of documents wrapped in paper. Someone pressed close in a crowd and her bag went light. She searched the street and checked the gutter. Nothing. She went to a police post and tried to explain what was missing. She could not list every document by name, and she could not fill out the form without help. A clerk copied down what she said. She walked home angry and tired, and she did not go back to that route the next week.

Her children reached adulthood and began to scatter across the Cali metro area—some close, some in nearby municipalities where rent was cheaper. One daughter, Adriana, stayed near enough to visit weekly. Another, Marta, moved farther out with her own family. The sons worked irregular jobs, better in some years than others. Nubia kept working as long as she could, cleaning and washing for pay. She saved coins in a tin and kept separate money for food, bus fare, and church.

Rafael died in the 1980s. After that, Nubia’s religious practice changed. A niece invited her to a small evangelical church that met in a rented storefront. Nubia began going. She stopped making promesas to saints and stopped putting candles in front of saint images. She still kept a few Catholic habits in the house out of familiarity, but she carried a small Bible and joined prayer meetings. The new church gave her a different circle of women: neighbors and relatives who visited, sang, and prayed out loud. They shared food and news. They prayed for sons who disappeared for days, for husbands who drank, for money to pay the electric bill.

The city’s insecurity grew in the late 1980s and 1990s with drug trafficking and the violence tied to it. People spoke quietly about which streets to avoid and which bus stops were dangerous after dark. Nubia adjusted her schedule. She left jobs earlier and stayed on main roads. If a relative offered to walk her part of the way, she accepted.

In the early 1990s, she developed high blood pressure and chest pain that came and went. She went to clinics and came home with pills she had to take daily. When money was short, she tried to stretch the supply by taking them less often. She learned which foods made her ankles swell and which chores made her chest tighten. She stopped carrying heavy loads. She still took smaller cleaning jobs, but she no longer accepted houses with stairs that needed washing from top to bottom in one day.

She became the person others leaned on. When one of her daughters had a difficult birth, the baby stayed in Nubia’s care during the day while the mother recovered and the father worked. When a relative fell ill, Nubia cooked, cleaned, and sat through long clinic waits. She kept track of medicines by counting tablets and arranging them in folded paper. She asked others to read labels and instructions, then repeated them until she memorized them.

By the early 2000s her eyesight deteriorated. Cataracts and age made even simple text hard to read. She held papers close to her face and still missed words. She stopped taking jobs that required careful scrubbing of bathrooms and floors because she could not see slippery patches and did not trust her footing. She depended on extended family for errands and for paperwork. She moved in with kin rather than living with her own children, sharing a room and a routine. A niece handled bills and read out clinic instructions. Nubia still made her bed tight, folded her clothes, and insisted on a clean kitchen.

In late 2010, her heart disease caught up with her. She died on December 30, 2010, at age eighty-three, in the Cali metro area where she had spent her whole life working, raising children, praying, and keeping order in whatever room she was given.
