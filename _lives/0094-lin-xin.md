# ethnicity: Han (Eastern Han frontier settlers/registered households in Hexi–Jiuquan
#   region)
# father_occupation: Tenant farmer + seasonal wage laborer (harvest/land clearing/odd
#   jobs) as a regular supplement
# historical_context:
# - event: State corvée and fiscal extraction pressures on commoners (labor levies for
#     roads/canals/forts, transport duties, grain/cloth taxes), which could tighten
#     in response to frontier needs
#   timing: recurring; most salient in working adulthood ages ~16–60 (68–112 AD)
# - event: Arid-zone drought variability causing local harvest shortfalls and food-price
#     spikes (small precipitation changes in Hexi often translate into major yield swings)
#   timing: intermittent; one or more bad-year clusters likely in his adulthood (e.g.,
#     ages ~25–45)
# household_social_status: Tenant/land-poor laboring household (dependent on larger
#   landholders; frequent wage labor)
# household_structure_at_birth: Married biological parents in a patrilocal extended
#   household (father’s parents and/or unmarried siblings also present)

# narrative_plan:
#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: 96
#     name: Lin Bo
#     narrative_role: Hard-driving, pragmatic provider; expects obedience and resents
#       Xin’s withdrawn nature. Relationship is tense but not abusive—more about criticism
#       and disappointment, especially around Xin’s failure to marry and stabilize.
#     role: father (tenant farmer + seasonal wage labor)
#   - death_year: 101
#     name: Lin Wang
#     narrative_role: Primary emotional anchor in childhood; worries incessantly after
#       infant deaths. With Xin she is gentle but anxious, teaching him thrift and household
#       rites; her later death is a major trigger for a prolonged depressive slump.
#     role: mother (household labor + textile work)
#   - death_year: 66
#     name: Old Master Lin
#     narrative_role: Embodies household authority and ancestor-rite discipline; Xin
#       fears his temper. His death shifts power to Lin Bo and increases economic pressure
#       on the household.
#     role: paternal grandfather (co-resident elder at birth)
#   - death_year: 72
#     name: Grandmother Lin
#     narrative_role: Superstitious and ritual-focused; pushes protective offerings
#       and scolds Xin for ‘inviting’ misfortune. Provides early caregiving but also
#       amplifies Xin’s anxiety with warnings and omens.
#     role: paternal grandmother
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Lin Cheng
#     narrative_role: Son of Lin Yong or an older collateral line; becomes the household
#       head by Xin’s late old age. Keeps Xin fed and sheltered, but expects him to
#       be useful (mind children, repair tools, watch animals), creating friction.
#     role: nephew (household head in Xin’s old age)
#   children:
#   - birth_year: 71
#     death_age: 79
#     death_year: 150
#     name: Zhao Yu
#     narrative_role: Daughter raised in her mother’s household and later married out;
#       Xin has only intermittent, cautious contact. In old age, she may send small
#       gifts via kin networks but cannot openly incorporate him into her husband’s
#       lineage.
#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 18
#     connection: Occurs during adolescent festival/work gatherings; leads directly
#       to Zhao Mei’s pregnancy and the birth of Zhao Yu (71), shaping Xin’s lifelong
#       unmarried status and shame.
#     incident: premarital_sex
#   - age: 22
#     connection: Triggered by frontier corvée/levy demands; contributes to his wariness,
#       sleep disturbance, and irritability (neuroticism + low agreeableness), affecting
#       later social prospects.
#     incident: military_service
#   - age: 24
#     connection: Happens while away for seasonal harvest labor; reinforces distrust
#       of coworkers and reluctance to lodge communally, narrowing his social world
#       further.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 27
#     connection: Occurs during a trip for work in a market town; afterward he avoids
#       repeated visits, partly from shame and partly from mistrust, deepening isolation.
#     incident: sex_work
#   - age: 31
#     connection: Directly linked to drought variability and rent pressure; worsens
#       depressive symptoms, increases conflict with father, and delays any chance of
#       saving for marriage.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 41
#     connection: Reduces his earning capacity; makes him more dependent on kin and
#       more embittered, cementing lifelong bachelor status and eventual old-age dependency.
#     incident: serious_accident
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-7
#     key_events:
#     - Lives in an extended patrilocal household under strict elder authority; experiences
#       the deaths of two infant sisters (54, 58) as household trauma.
#     - Younger brother Lin Qiang falls ill and dies at age 7 (63 AD), shaping Xin’s
#       later rumination and fear of sickness.
#     - 'Begins labor tasks early: herding small animals, gathering fuel, carrying water;
#       learns household offering routines without literacy.'
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 8-19
#     key_events:
#     - Economic precarity intensifies after grandparents’ deaths (66, 72); Xin becomes
#       a steady worker but remains socially withdrawn.
#     - 'Becomes known as observant and inventive (high openness): notices weather signs,
#       tries small work-arounds for tools, but also gets labeled ‘odd’ and ‘cold’ by
#       peers.'
#     - Secret courtship with Zhao Mei (70–71) leads to pregnancy and separation; daughter
#       Zhao Yu is born (71).
#     phase: Later childhood & adolescence
#   - age_range: 20-30
#     key_events:
#     - Called for militia/auxiliary duty (74–75), exposing him to frontier discipline
#       and violence talk; returns more wary and irritable.
#     - Victim of theft while lodging with laborers during harvest (76), reinforcing
#       mistrust and isolation.
#     - One-off transactional sex in Jiuquan market town (79) during seasonal work;
#       followed by self-reproach and renewed withdrawal.
#     phase: Young adulthood
#   - age_range: 31-55
#     key_events:
#     - 'Severe household economic crisis during drought/poor harvest years (83–85):
#       pawning goods, food-wage labor, heightened depressive symptoms.'
#     - Youngest brother Lin Yong dies at 29 (90), leaving Xin without a same-generation
#       male ally; nephews begin to dominate household decisions.
#     - Serious harvest accident (93) crushes lower leg; long recovery and lasting stiffness
#       reduce earning power and increase dependency.
#     phase: Mid-adulthood
#   - age_range: 56-87
#     key_events:
#     - Parents’ deaths (father 96, mother 101) remove the last buffer; Xin’s status
#       becomes that of an elderly dependent uncle in his nephew’s household.
#     - Periodic low moods and irritability continue; he contributes with light tasks,
#       childcare supervision, and weather-watching rather than heavy field work.
#     - Dies in 139 during an episode of severe diarrhea/dehydration; household performs
#       standard ancestor offerings and local protective rites.
#     phase: Late adulthood & old age

#     relationship: Nephew and later household head; both caretaker and source of conflict
#   partners:
#   - name: Zhao Mei
#     narrative_role: Unmarried young woman from a nearby poor household; their secret

#       once pregnancy is suspected; Xin carries enduring longing and shame.
#     relationship_end_year: 71
#     relationship_start_year: 70
#   - name: Lady Qiu
#     narrative_role: A woman at an inn/teahouse in a Jiuquan market town; the encounter
#       is transactional and wordless, leaving Xin with mixed relief and self-disgust
#       rather than attachment.

#   - birth_year: 50
#     death_age: 76
#     death_year: 126
#     name: Lin Shi
#     narrative_role: Eldest sibling and early helper-mother figure; protective but
#       sometimes sharp-tongued with Xin. Marries out to a nearby household yet remains

#       for him within the wider lineage.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: 52
#     death_age: 87
#     death_year: 139
#     name: Lin Xin
#     narrative_role: Protagonist; a quiet, watchful laborer with a suspicious edge
#       and recurring low mood, but personally honest. Never marries; remains tied to
#       his natal patriline and ends life as an elderly dependent uncle.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 54
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 54
#     name: Lin Nü
#     narrative_role: Infant death remembered mainly through mother’s grief; becomes
#       a reference point for the household’s fear of illness and bad luck.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: 56
#     death_age: 7
#     death_year: 63
#     name: Lin Qiang

#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 58
#     name: Lin Lan
#     narrative_role: Second infant loss; reinforces the sense of fragility and the
#       mother’s constant vigilance around sickness.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: 61
#     death_age: 29
#     death_year: 90
#     name: Lin Yong
#     narrative_role: Youngest brother; more socially able than Xin and pushes to form
#       his own household. His early adult death leaves nephews as Xin’s main later-life
#       anchors and sharpens Xin’s status as an unmarried dependent.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Gains a quiet reputation for ‘seeing things others miss,’ but peers
#       also call him strange; his ideas sometimes help the household, sometimes spark
#       ridicule.
#     scene: Xin experiments with small innovations—improvised padding for a cart yoke,
#       a different way of stacking sheaves to dry in low humidity, and obsessive attention
#       to cloud/wind patterns to predict scarce rain.
#     timing: adolescence through mid-adulthood (ages ~12-45)
#     trait: Openness (very high)
#   - consequence: Misses matchmaking opportunities and patronage; becomes easy to forget
#       in village decisions unless a crisis forces involvement.
#     scene: He avoids loud drinking gatherings after work, speaks in short answers,
#       and prefers solitary tasks (night watch, tool-mending) even when it costs him
#       connections.
#     timing: all phases, clearest in young adulthood (ages ~20-35)
#     trait: Extraversion (very low)
#   - consequence: Creates friction with coworkers and later with nephews; contributes
#       to remaining unmarried and to being treated as a burdensome but necessary kin.
#     scene: He argues bluntly about unfair grain measures and accuses others of cheating;
#       he holds grudges and refuses ritual reconciliation meals that would smooth disputes.
#     timing: young adulthood through old age (ages ~20-80)
#     trait: Agreeableness (very low)
#   - consequence: Chronic worry strains relationships and feeds depressive episodes;
#       he becomes cautious, sometimes missing opportunities due to fear of loss.
#     scene: He catastrophizes about drought and illness, replays memories of his brother’s
#       death and the lost bundle, and shows insomnia/irritability during lean years.
#     timing: childhood onward; spikes during crises (ages ~11, 31-33, 41-45, after
#       mother’s death)
#     trait: Neuroticism (very high)
#   - consequence: Builds a narrow kind of trust—people may not like him, but some believe
#       he won’t cheat; helps him retain a place in the kin household despite abrasiveness.
#     scene: Even when hungry, he refuses to short-weigh grain or steal from a neighbor’s
#       stack; he returns a dropped coin pouch to a traveler despite being mocked for
#       it.
#     timing: young adulthood onward (ages ~20-60)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (very high)
#   - consequence: Reduced work output during episodes and increased irritability; undermines
#       marriage prospects and deepens dependence on kin support.
#     scene: Periods of weeks-to-months where he withdraws, neglects grooming, speaks
#       of life as ‘heavy’ and ‘tasteless,’ has early-morning waking, low appetite,
#       and diminished drive—interspersed with more functional stretches.
#     timing: first clear episode after adolescent relationship collapse (ages ~19-20),
#       major recurrence during economic crisis (83-85), another after accident (93-95),
#       prolonged grief after mother’s death (101-103)
#     trait: Depressive disorder (recurrent/persistent symptoms)
# number_of_children: '1'
# number_of_siblings: '5'
# occupation: Agricultural laborer/field hand (working others’ land for wages; seasonal
#   work dominant)
# religion: Household ancestor offerings + local earth/grain/door-stove spirits + seasonal
#   festivals (typical Han popular practice)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: While lodging with other laborers during harvest work near a small market
#     hamlet on the Hexi corridor, his bundle (a spare padded jacket, knife, and a little
#     cash/grain) was stolen overnight; he suspected a fellow worker but had no practical
#     way to recover it.
#   reasoning: Petty theft and occasional robbery were common in low-trust, low-policing
#     rural settings, and as a poor household he had limited but still meaningful assets
#     (grain, tools, clothing) vulnerable to theft.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 24 (76 AD); single event
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: After a run of poor rains and crop failure, his household fell behind on
#     rent and grain payments and had to pawn clothing and tools; for a time he worked
#     away for food wages and the family survived on thin gruel and borrowed millet
#     until the next better harvest.
#   reasoning: Land-poor tenant/laboring households in Eastern Han were highly vulnerable
#     to bad harvests, rent pressure, and debt, and over an 87-year life at least one
#     severe hardship episode is likely.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 31–33 (83–85 AD); sustained period
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: During late-summer harvesting he slipped while loading sheaves onto an ox
#     cart and the wheel/axle crushed his lower leg; he was laid up for weeks with swelling
#     and fever, and afterward walked with lingering pain and stiffness.
#   reasoning: As a lifelong agricultural day laborer in a harsh rural environment (tools,
#     animals, falls, exposure), a significant injury episode is a common route to weeks
#     of incapacity.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 41 (93 AD); single event
#   type: serious_accident
# - event: In his late teens he had a secret relationship with an unmarried young woman
#     from a nearby household; they met during communal work and festivals, and she
#     later bore a daughter whom her family raised and later married out.
#   reasoning: Because he never married yet fathered a daughter, the most plausible
#     scenario is a non-marital relationship earlier in life that would be categorized
#     as premarital sex under the project’s labels.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 18–19 (70–71 AD); sustained period
#   type: premarital_sex
# - event: On a trip to a larger market town in Jiuquan prefecture for seasonal work,
#     he paid a woman working out of an inn/teahouse with grain and a small coin payment
#     for sex, treating it as a discreet, one-off visit rather than a continuing arrangement.
#   reasoning: Frontier corridor towns could have transactional sex, and a poor unmarried
#     laborer might occasionally use it, but low extraversion and chronic low resources
#     keep it from being the dominant explanation.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 27 (79 AD); single event
#   type: sex_work
# - event: 'He was called for short-term militia/auxiliary duty tied to the local commandery:
#     guarding a watchpost and escorting grain carts along a section of route between
#     settlements, sleeping in makeshift barracks and drilling with spear and bow.'
#   reasoning: Frontier commanderies relied on conscription/militia and labor levies;
#     a poor local male had nontrivial odds of some militia or auxiliary duty even if
#     primarily a laborer.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 22–23 (74–75 AD); sustained period
#   type: military_service

Lin Xin was born in 52 in the desert-edge country north of the Hexi Corridor, under the Eastern Han. The magistrate’s clerks wrote household registers in Chinese, and soldiers and couriers moved along the corridor toward Dunhuang and the Western Regions. Lin’s family spoke the local Sinitic speech of the commandery and kept the practices of Han households: a board for the ancestors, a stove spirit to be soothed, and offerings at the new year.

He arrived as the second child in a crowded patrilocal home. His grandfather, Old Master Lin, held the senior seat and controlled the grain jar keys. His father, Lin Bo, rented fields and took whatever wage work he could find when rent came due. Lin’s mother, Lin Wang, spun and wove, cooked, hauled water, and kept the children from wandering too close to the dry gullies and wind-cut slopes.

His older sister, Lin Shi, was two when he was born. She learned early to carry a small child on her hip and to pinch dough into quick cakes when the adults were away. The household had its losses. In 54 an infant sister, Lin Nü, died within days; Lin Wang laid a little rice and a splash of wine before the ancestors and kept her face turned away when she spoke. Another child, Lin Qiang, born in 56, was lively for a few years, then in 63 he sickened and died at seven. Lin Xin kept replaying the last day: the boy’s dry mouth, the way the adults argued about whether to call a ritual woman from a neighboring settlement. When he was older and someone mentioned that year’s bad wind, he answered too sharply, then walked off and sat alone behind the goat pen until dark.

A second infant sister, Lin Lan, died in 58. Lin Wang stopped letting the children drink straight from the water skin; she made them wait while she boiled water in a soot-black pot. She also listened hard to Lin Xin’s small complaints—headaches, stomach knots, a cough that lasted too long—and that attention stayed with him into adulthood.

Old Master Lin died in 66. The household authority passed fully to Lin Bo, and with it came harsher talk about rent, labor, and the shame of owing grain. Lin Xin turned to tasks that kept him away from arguments. He liked repairing rope and straps and padding a yoke so an ox’s neck did not raw. He watched the sky in the evening and judged the wind by the feel of grit on his tongue. Lin Bo called it useless staring. Lin Wang kept a small place for her son at the hearth and handed him the better bowl when there was one.

Grandmother Lin died in 72. She had been the one who insisted on extra offerings to the stove spirit—bits of fat, a smear of honey when they had it—so the household would be spared sickness. After her death, Lin Xin kept the habit anyway, pressing a crumb of cake to the soot-dark corner above the stove before the family ate.

At eighteen, in 70, he began meeting Zhao Mei, an unmarried girl from a nearby poor household. They came together first during communal work—bundling brush for fuel—and then at a festival where people traded cloth and sang to the beat of handclaps. Lin Xin said little when others teased, but with Zhao Mei he spoke in short, serious sentences and listened closely. They met again in a dry poplar break beyond the fields. He did not bring her gifts beyond what he could carry in his sleeve: a small strip of dyed thread, a sweet date once. The next year she showed signs of pregnancy. Her relatives took her away from the gathering places. Lin Xin confronted her brother in the open and accused him of hiding her; the brother shouted back that Lin had no bride-price and no temper fit for a wife. Zhao Mei gave birth in 71 to a daughter, Zhao Yu, and raised the child in her own household. Lin Xin saw the baby once, at a distance, when Aunt Chen carried news between families; he stared too long and then left without speaking.

Lin Bo pushed him toward marriage after that, partly to close mouths. Lin Xin resisted every suggested match. He pointed out the cost of a wedding, the cost of a household, the risk of hunger. He also refused to smile and flatter when he was put in front of women’s elders. Lin Shi, married by then to a man in a nearby settlement, tried to soften it by joking that he spoke to matchmakers as if they were tax clerks. Lin Xin did not laugh.

At twenty-two, in 74, the commandery drew men for militia and auxiliary duty. Lin Xin was taken for a term and sent to a watchpost. He learned to sleep in lines on hard ground and to eat ration millet without complaint. He drilled with spear and bow, then spent days escorting grain carts between settlements and a relay station. An older man, Lao Du, showed him how to wrap felt around his calves to prevent sores and how to tuck a pinch of salt into porridge to make it less bitter. Lin Xin listened, asked a few pointed questions, then kept to himself. When a cart wheel broke, he argued with the officer about whether the axle had been poorly fitted, and the officer struck him once with a stick and told him to shut his mouth. After he returned home, he slept lightly and woke early, scanning the yard before speaking to anyone.

He worked harvest jobs away from home when there was need. At twenty-four, in 76, he lodged with other laborers near a small market hamlet along the corridor. That night someone stole his bundle: a spare padded jacket, a knife, and a little cash and grain. He knew which man had watched him pack, but there was no proof and no clerk to hear a complaint. In the morning he searched the sleeping area, looked at faces, and said one sentence—“A thief sleeps among you”—then walked out with only what he wore.

At twenty-seven, in 79, he traveled to a larger market town in Jiuquan prefecture for seasonal work. The streets were louder than his village, and he hated the jostling. That night he paid a woman, Lady Qiu, at an inn-teahouse with grain and a small coin payment. He said almost nothing, and afterward he washed and sat outside until the courtyard quieted. He returned home with a sour mood and avoided the town for a long time.

Bad years came when he was thirty-one. In 83 the rains failed and the fields gave thin stalks. Rent still came due. Lin Bo pawned clothing and a tool, and the household ate thin gruel. Lin Xin went out for food-wage labor, clearing land, hauling loads, doing whatever was offered. He grew quick to anger when someone joked about his empty bowl. Some mornings he stayed sitting on a low stool by the stove long after others left, staring at his hands, then forcing himself up when his mother scolded. The crisis stretched through 85 before better yields returned.

His youngest brother, Lin Yong, reached adulthood with more ease than Lin Xin. Lin Yong joked with workers, negotiated with overseers, and talked about forming his own household. In 90, at twenty-nine, Lin Yong died—an illness that moved fast, leaving no time for promises. Lin Xin’s nephews were still children. Their mother looked at Lin Xin with a mix of demand and suspicion, as if his presence in the yard made him responsible.

At forty-one, in 93, he suffered the accident that ended his best working years. During late-summer harvesting he slipped while loading sheaves onto an ox cart. The wheel and axle crushed his lower leg. He lay up for weeks with swelling and fever. Xu the Carter, whose cart it was, avoided him at first; when Lin Xin demanded help with food and cloth for bandages, Xu argued about blame. Lin Xin shouted until his voice broke. The household fed him and kept him alive, but he never walked the same. He returned to work with stiffness and pain, choosing tasks that let him brace himself: sorting sheaves, mending straps, watching animals, taking the night watch.

Lin Bo died in 96. Lin Wang held on until 101, still spinning when her fingers allowed it. After her death, Lin Xin’s moods deepened. He slept in broken stretches, snapped at children for small noise, then withdrew and refused meals. Later he resumed a narrow routine: at dawn he swept the yard slowly, checked the water jar, and pressed a crumb of food near the stove place for the spirit. He took quiet satisfaction in predicting a cold snap before it arrived, insisting on extra reed bundles for the hearth and being proved right.

In old age he lived in his nephew Lin Cheng’s extended household. Lin Cheng expected obedience and usefulness; Lin Xin answered in hard, clipped words and did what he judged necessary, not what was requested. Lin Shi visited from time to time, gray-haired and steady, bringing a strip of cloth or dried dates. Once, when she teased him for scolding the children too harshly, he answered, “Better they learn now than starve later.” She told him his mouth never softened, and that made two of them laugh, briefly.

He died in 139 after a bout of severe diarrhea that left him unable to keep water down. The household laid him out, washed him, and placed a small cup of water and a bit of millet near his head. They buried him in the local ground with the lineage’s dead, and Lin Cheng set out wine and cooked grain at the ancestor place so Lin Xin would be received among them.
