#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Mother
#     narrative_role: 'Primary caretaker by default in a mother-centered household.
#       Relationship quality: intensely bonded in the immediate postpartum hours, with
#       care shaped by exhaustion and urgency after a difficult birth. She likely survived
#       this childbirth (since the baby died from asphyxia/trauma rather than maternal
#       death), but her later death year is unknown.'
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Father
#     narrative_role: Non-resident/absent partner at birth; described as a savanna hunter
#       when present. Relationship quality with the protagonist is effectively 'not
#       formed' because the infant died the day of birth; socially, his connection would
#       be mediated through the mother and siblings, and his level of involvement is
#       uncertain.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Maternal Grandmother
#     narrative_role: 'Plausible secondary caretaker/support figure in a mother-centered
#       household, especially around childbirth (helping with delivery, warming, feeding
#       the mother, ritual protection). Relationship quality: practical, protective;
#       may be the person who interprets the death in terms of spirit-danger or taboo.'
#     role: grandmother

#   - name: Senior Midwife/Healer
#     prominence: supporting

#     death_age: 45
#     death_year: -3000
#     name: Older Brother
#     narrative_role: Eldest sibling, much older (about a generation gap). At the time
#       of the protagonist’s birth he was a fully adult man—an active hunter/provider
#       figure in the camp. He was alive when the baby was born but died in the same
#       year; in narrative terms he can be remembered by others as having helped steady
#       the mother’s household and then being lost soon after, leaving a sharper sense
#       of vulnerability.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: -3024
#     death_age: 24
#     death_year: -3000
#     name: Older Sister
#     narrative_role: Middle child and the closest in age. At the time of the birth
#       she was a young adult woman, likely deeply involved in day-to-day support for
#       their mother (gathering, childcare help, water/fuel collecting). Alive when
#       the baby was born; her death in the same year suggests a household crisis year.
#       In interpersonal texture she is the one most likely to have held the newborn,
#       helped with the birth, and been the mother’s main emotional support.

The camp sat on a rise above a bend of the White Nile, where acacia scrub opened into grass and hard ground. No town governed the place. Kin groups moved and argued and traded favors, speaking a Nilo-Saharan tongue and watching for the spirits that lived in the river eddies, the tall termite mounds, and the wind that came hot across the savanna.

The household belonged to a woman raising children without a resident husband. Her eldest, Older Brother, had been born forty-five rains earlier. He hunted away from the river, following spoor with other men and coming back with strips of dried meat, hide, and news. Older Sister, born twenty-four rains earlier, stayed close to their mother. She carried water in a skin bag, dug for bulbs and roots with a pointed stick, and kept the hearth fed with thornwood.

On a day of hard heat near the start of the rains, the mother went into labor in the shade of a low shelter. Maternal Grandmother and the camp’s senior birth attendant, Senior Midwife/Healer, rubbed the mother’s belly with fat and pressed a smooth stone charm into her palm. They spoke to the river-place and to the spirits of nearby trees, and set a small pinch of powdered ochre and crushed seed on the ground beside the mat.

A boy was born last, child three of three. His head and shoulders came badly; the cord lay tight. He did not draw breath.

They washed him with warm water, wrapped him in soft hide, and laid him in a shallow scrape above the flood line. Older Sister placed a few beads and a scrap of dried fish beside him, then covered the body with earth and stones.
