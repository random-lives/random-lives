Gao Alian was born in the spring of 348, when the fields near the Taihang foothills showed green at the margins and bare loess in the middle where last year’s stalks had been turned under. In dry wind the ground broke into powder; after rain it turned to paste that stuck to feet and cart wheels. Her family lived in her father’s parents’ house and worked land they did not own. Rent went out in grain and cloth. Her grandfather counted every measure twice and kept the storage jar sealed with a cord no child was allowed to touch.

Work filled the day. The quern rasped. A kettle sang. A loom struck its frame. Her mother spun and watched everything at once, quick to see what was missing and quicker to slap a hand away. Alian learned early that her hands did not hold to a task. She tied a bundle and left it half done. She put the needle down and could not find it again. She stirred millet and walked off to answer a voice in the lane, then returned to a pot scorched at the bottom. When she was scolded she did not talk back. She nodded, smiled, and reached for the next job, already forgetting the last.

She remembered stories the way other children remembered chores. If an old woman recited a tale at a winter hearth, Alian could repeat it the next day with the same turns and the same names. But she could not keep a routine. Three days of oiling the shuttle and keeping the warp even was beyond her. She started fast, drifted, then came back too late and pretended she had meant it.

In her early years men with different badges passed along the road. After Later Zhao fell, the village headman changed his tone and his orders, then changed them again. Counting boards came out, then came out again under different hands. The estate’s agent began arriving more often and asking sharper questions. Her father learned to hide grain in a jar sunk under the floor and to speak with his eyes lowered. He went when he owed labor. He came back with blisters and said nothing that could be repeated.

Under Former Yan, demands hit the village like weather. Soldiers wanted fodder and straw sandals. Draft lists took boys before their voices changed. Alian’s brother grew tall and careful. He could carry beans to the storehouse without stealing any and without losing any. Alian could not be trusted with a full basket. She set it down to answer someone and walked off. If a jar was left unsealed near her, the lid stayed off. Her carelessness brought shouting into the house and made her mother’s face tight and watchful.

Alian talked as easily as she breathed. In the lane she traded news and pulled it out of others. She repeated what she heard, even after being told not to. She spoke too fast in front of elders. She told one neighbor what another had said, then forgot that she had done it. People started to pause when she came near. When she needed help later, she found fewer hands willing.

No one taught her characters. The clerk in the village kept the brush and the tallies; his work decided how much grain left a household and how many days a man owed. Alian learned numbers with pebbles and knots in cord, the way women did when they measured thread and counted bowls. She could see when a scale arm dipped wrong. She could add quickly in her head. But she could not keep her own obligations straight. She promised her mother she would set aside thread for the rent cloth, then used it to patch sleeves and fix a torn sash. When the deadline came, she acted surprised and swore she had more time.

In her teens she sat at the loom for long hours. When she felt watched she worked hard and fast. When no one watched, her attention broke. The weave went uneven. The edge frayed. Her mother stayed close, clicking her tongue and stopping the shuttle with a sharp hand. That was how Alian learned: correction, not mastery.

Rituals held the year in place even when rulers did not. In spring and late summer the women carried a dish of grain and greens to the earth shrine at the field edge. They bowed and burned incense. When incense ran out they burned dried mugwort and pine needles and let the smoke stand in for what they could not buy. On household offering days Alian set bowls before the ancestor tablets and kept children from grabbing food early. She did not talk about belief. She did it because failing to do it brought quarrels, sickness, and blame.

Around 370 Former Qin took Former Yan’s territory, and the village felt it in the way it always did: through quotas and labor. New officials posted orders at the headman’s yard. The headman repeated them until his voice went hoarse. Grain and cloth were set by weight and length, and the agent began bringing a measuring cord and insisting on his own count. Men were taken to haul grain to a larger storehouse and to repair roads and embankments. Alian’s husband, a tenant like her father, was sent with a hauling group. He returned thinner, burned dark, and angry at small things. He said the seals on the tablets had changed. The whips had not.

Alian married into a household in the same countryside. She still knew the ditches, the wells, and which trees dropped straight wood for fuel. Marriage shifted work onto her back. She rose before dawn, ground millet, boiled water, mended clothes, and kept the loom moving whenever there was light. In planting and harvest she worked the rented plots with sleeves tied up and hair bound tight, pulling weeds until her fingers split.

She gave birth three times. Her first daughter died in her first year. That summer the heat stayed even at night, flies thick around the doorway. The baby’s belly swelled and cramped. Alian carried her until her arms shook, then laid her down and went to fetch water and forgot why she had gone. The child died before dawn. Neighbors helped dig the small grave. Alian washed the cloth that had been under the baby and went back to the loom. The older women watched her and said she had stone in her chest. She did not. She could not sit still with grief. If her hands stopped, her thoughts ran wild, so she kept moving.

Her husband died before she reached thirty-five. After that the household shrank and debts showed. Without a man to bargain with the agent or trade labor days, Alian stood at the gate herself. She talked quickly, smiling as if speed could cover shortage. It could not. One autumn she delivered a bolt of rent cloth that came up short. The agent measured it twice, then slapped it down on the bench. He ordered two extra labor days.

Alian argued. She grabbed the measuring cord and pointed at a knot, claiming it had been moved. She spoke over the agent and over the headman when he came to quiet them. She did not choose her words; they spilled out. The agent’s face hardened. The headman, tired of disputes that brought trouble from above, told Alian to do the days and stop making noise. She did the work hauling reeds to repair an embankment, hands raw by the second evening. After that, the agent watched her more closely and gave her less time.

Her son grew into a boy who understood hunger. Her surviving daughter carried water and stripped hemp, steady where Alian was not. Still, the household ran on thin margins. In bad weeks Alian traded thread for grain. She borrowed bowls and returned them late, not out of malice but because she forgot. Neighbors began to demand repayment on the spot. When she promised to come help thresh, she arrived after half the work was done and insisted she had been there yesterday. People stopped relying on her.

To stretch what they had, Alian worked with a neighbor’s family at their small pottery kiln after harvest. The kiln made storage jars and cooking pots that could be traded for grain or used to keep millet from damp and mice. On firing days fuel had to be carried fast and stacked close. Smoke lay low in the cool mornings and stung the eyes.

In the autumn of 383, after the harvest rush, she carried a basket of dry stalks and brush toward the fire pit beside the kiln. A plank lay over a shallow ditch. It had been left loose after the last hauling day. Alian stepped onto it without looking. Her foot slid. The basket tipped. She threw her weight toward the falling load, trying to save it, and went down hard. Her shoulder struck first, then the side of her head on packed earth near the pit.

She did not rise. At first she made no sound. Then she began to groan and retch. Neighbors dragged her away from the heat and laid her on a mat. Her breathing turned wet and uneven. Fever came by nightfall. On October 26, 383, she died in the small room where her loom stood, the warp still stretched tight because she had not tied off the last cloth.
