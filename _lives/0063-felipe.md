Felipe was born on 12 November 1737 in San Pedro Chacabal, in the Motul district of the Spanish Empire’s Yucatán. His family spoke Yucatec Maya at home and lived under parish Catholic authority, mixing church devotions with household rites. The compound held several related households and a shared cooking space where maize was ground on stone and pots simmered over a low fire.

His father, K’inam, worked a milpa outside the village and brought back maize, beans, and squash, sometimes a turkey or eggs. His mother, Ixchel, spun and wove for tribute and exchange, keeping thread taut across her backstrap loom while women of the house watched the children. Felipe’s oldest brothers, Juan and Antonio, were old men with grown responsibilities of their own. They spoke to K’inam about fields and obligations and held Felipe briefly when he was first carried out to be shown to kin. Before the year ended, both brothers died, and their deaths drew the family into wakes and prayers before the household cross and candles.

María, seventeen, stayed close to Ixchel. She carried Felipe on her hip while Ixchel worked, rocking him when he cried and handing him back when he rooted for milk.

During the dry months Felipe failed to gain weight. Ixchel tried more frequent nursing and thin maize gruel. On 30 April 1738 he died in the house. The family wrapped his body in cloth, lit candles, and brought him to the churchyard for burial with prayers to the saints.
