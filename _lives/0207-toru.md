#     name: Dema
#     narrative_role: 'Mixed subsistence cultivator-forager; taught Toru paths, tools,
#       and the rules for forest-edge access. Relationship: demanding and quick to anger;
#       used physical punishment and shaming, which fits Toru’s later hypervigilance
#       and sensitivity to insult.'

#     name: Vena
#     narrative_role: 'Primarily domestic and childcare-focused due to recurrent illness/weakness;
#       often protective and soothing, but stretched thin. Relationship: Toru is attached
#       to her and becomes more unstable and suspicious after her death.'
#     role: mother
#   children:
#   - birth_year: 513
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 513
#     name: Giru
#     narrative_role: Only child; dies in infancy (within days or weeks). Toru fixates
#       on the death as a sign of bad fortune and becomes more controlling and wary
#       in the years after.
#     sex: M
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 32
#     connection: After widowhood (519) and increasing dependence, Toru takes more risky
#       dry-season trips with forest produce; sleeping on the settlement edge and bargaining
#       while anxious makes him vulnerable to repeated petty theft.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 34
#     connection: In the same seasons as the forest-edge dispute escalates, losses of
#       tools/bundles deepen stress and feed Toru’s suspicion, helping set the stage
#       for violent confrontation.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 36
#     connection: By mid-30s he is lodging under a patron and has less control over
#       storage/security; continued small theft reinforces his marginalized status.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 34
#     connection: Triggered by a dispute over wood-cutting/grazing access during late
#       dry season; aftermath contributes to his ‘trouble’ reputation and accelerates
#       shift into dependent lodging/work.

#   - name: Hani
#     narrative_role: 'Wife in a customary local union beginning when Toru is ~20. Relationship
#       quality: strained by Toru’s irritability, jealousy, and fearfulness; also periods

#   - birth_year: 474
#     death_age: 49
#     death_year: 523
#     name: Kora
#     narrative_role: Eldest sibling; a steady, practical presence who remembers harsher
#       years and tries to keep kin ties intact. As Toru becomes more conflict-prone
#       and anxious, she alternates between protecting him and scolding him for making
#       enemies.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: 476
#     death_age: 78
#     death_year: 554
#     name: Madi
#     narrative_role: 'Older brother; competent provider and the family’s strongest
#       adult anchor. Their relationship is tense: Madi expects cooperation and restraint,
#       while Toru is suspicious, touchy, and resents being treated as a burden—especially
#       after Toru’s widowhood and decline.'
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 481
#     death_age: 25
#     death_year: 506
#     name: Naka
#     narrative_role: Closest in age; shared childhood tasks and forest routes. Her
#       early adult death becomes a lasting reference point for Toru’s anxiety (fear
#       of sickness/omens) and contributes to the family’s sense that misfortune follows
#       him.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Worsens sleep and decision-making, increases irritability and suspicion,
#       makes him a difficult partner/neighbor, and contributes to social marginalization.
#     scene: Before leaving for forest work or market, Toru repeatedly checks lashings,
#       re-ties bundles, scans paths for ambush, and startles at sudden noises; during
#       a community fever season he has breathless, chest-tight spells he interprets
#       as impending death.
#     timing: Begins in childhood (ages ~6-10), becomes pronounced after sister’s death
#       (age 19) and infant son’s death (age 26), peaks after widowhood (age 32+).
#     trait: Anxiety disorder (generalized anxiety/hypervigilance with panic-like episodes)
#   - consequence: Weak social network and fewer allies in disputes; fewer protections
#       against theft and violence.
#     scene: At gatherings he stays at the edge, speaks briefly, avoids joking and reciprocal
#       banter; at markets he bargains minimally and leaves early rather than cultivating
#       relationships.
#     timing: Visible from adolescence onward (ages ~12+).
#     trait: Very low Extraversion (7th percentile)
#   - consequence: Missed adaptation opportunities (new exchange relationships, altered
#       cropping/foraging patterns), contributing to economic fragility.
#     scene: Rejects new tools/techniques or unfamiliar routes; distrusts innovations
#       suggested by others; insists on ‘the old way’ even when conditions shift after
#       a bad monsoon.
#     timing: Adolescence through adulthood (ages ~13-38).
#     trait: Very low Openness (4th percentile)
#   - consequence: Reputation as quarrelsome; higher risk of assault and exclusion from
#       cooperative labor arrangements.
#     scene: Responds to minor slights with harsh words; escalates arguments over boundaries,
#       shares, and accusations of theft; holds grudges and refuses easy reconciliation.
#     timing: Late childhood onward (ages ~10-38), most consequential in his 30s.
#     trait: Low Agreeableness (19th percentile)
#   - consequence: Mutual distrust; neighbors more willing to punish him or refuse help,
#       feeding a downward social spiral.
#     scene: Tends to assume others are cheating and sometimes cuts corners himself
#       (e.g., taking extra from shared stores or stretching customary forest-edge rules),
#       while denying wrongdoing.
#     timing: Adulthood (ages ~18-38).
#     trait: Low Honesty-Humility (14th percentile)
# number_of_children: '1'
# number_of_siblings: '3'
# occupation: Mixed subsistence cultivator-forager (small plots + forest product gathering;
#   some hunting/trapping)
# religion: Local spirit/deity propitiation with household offerings (food/beer, flowers),
#   plus communal seasonal rites (rain/harvest) led by a village ritual specialist
# sibling_ages_at_death:
# - 49
# - 78
# - 25
# sibling_sexes:
# - F
# - M
# - F
# structured_incidents:
# - event: 'Recurring pattern: during the dry-season weeks when he brought forest produce
#     (fuelwood, edible fruits/flowers, small bundles of tendu-like leaves) to a nearby
#     market hamlet, part of his bundle or a tool/knife would be quietly taken while
#     he slept near the edge of the settlement or while he was distracted bargaining;
#     he could not prove who did it and had to absorb the loss.'
#   reasoning: Theft of food, tools, stored grain, or forest goods is common in subsistence
#     settings, and marginal dependents/lodgers are easy targets.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 31–36 (especially during several dry seasons)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: 'Single event: after a dispute over access to a patch of forest edge used
#     for cutting wood and grazing, a group of men from a neighboring hamlet confronted
#     him on a path and beat him with sticks and fists, leaving him bruised and limping
#     for days; the incident worsened his reputation as "trouble" and helped push him
#     into dependent lodging/work under a patron.'
#   reasoning: As a somewhat marginalized adult who did physically risky work and likely
#     had disputes over resources/status, experiencing at least one non-domestic serious
#     beating or fight is a leading subtype.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 34 (late dry season)
#   type: physical_assault

Toru was born at the end of the rains in 487, in the dry deciduous forests south of the Narmada and north of the Deccan routes, where officials from the Malwa plain came at intervals to demand grain, labor, or guides. His people spoke a Dravidian tongue at home and kept their own rites. They cut small plots at the forest edge and lived on what the land and trees gave—millets when the monsoon came on time, and flowers, fruit, and game when it did not. They marked danger and sickness with offerings, not writing. Toru never learned letters.

His father, Dema, lived by a mix of small cultivation and forest work, the same as his father before him. Dema kept a digging stick, a short-handled axe, and a sling by the doorway. He wanted quiet obedience. Toru was the last of four children. The eldest, Kora, already carried water and firewood when Toru began walking. Madi, the only older brother, followed their father into the forest and learned the boundaries between their patch and the next hamlet’s grazing. Naka, the younger of the older sisters, watched Toru more than anyone else; she shoved him away from thorn bushes, slapped his fingers when he reached toward embers, and shared roasted tubers when their mother was busy.

Vena, his mother, stayed close to the hearth and the infant most days. She tired easily and often stopped in the shade with her back against a post while the older girls finished pounding grain. When Toru was small, she wrapped him against her hip with a cloth and sent him to fetch kindling that lay in plain sight. He returned again and again to the same fallen branches and the same path. If another child pointed to a better place to gather, he shook his head and went where he had gone before.

Dema took him out early. At six Toru could carry a small bundle of fuelwood and keep pace without talking. He watched the edges of the path, not the canopy. When a branch cracked behind him he spun with the sling ready, breathing hard. Dema struck him once for dropping the bundle and again for arguing that someone had followed them. That night Toru slept lightly and sat up at every distant shout from another household.

The year Toru turned seven, coughs ran through the settlement after the rains. Adults argued over whose hearth smoke had drifted into another’s house, whose child had brought dirt from a polluted pool. Toru began to listen for throat-clearing and wheezing the way other boys listened for birdcalls. He pressed his ear to the reed wall when he lay down. If he heard his mother’s breathing change, he got up and put his hand to her forehead until she shoved him away.

By twelve, he worked with Madi on the forest edge. Madi moved fast and joked with others on the trail. Toru answered with short words. He hated the kind of teasing that involved touching or grabbing. Once, when a boy tried to lift his bundle as a prank, Toru swung his stick and caught the boy’s shoulder hard enough to leave a bruise. The adults made them share a meal to settle it, and Toru ate in silence, staring at the ground while the other boy talked.

In 504 the monsoon failed early. The millet heads came up thin. Forest foods helped, but the women spent longer days finding enough, and arguments over shares turned sharper. Toru began keeping his portion back, eating quickly behind the house before others could see. Kora noticed and scolded him. He snapped at her, then avoided her for days, sitting on a low rock near a termite mound where he could see the path coming.

Naka married out and then came back often, bringing gossip and a little salt or oil. In 506, at twenty-five, she died after a short sickness. Her husband carried her body back on a bamboo litter. The settlement women washed her and tied her hair. Toru did not leave the edge of the crowd; his hands shook when he tried to take the offered water. Afterward he began insisting on extra offerings whenever anyone coughed. He placed food on a leaf plate outside the doorway and poured a little fermented drink onto the ground for the nearby spirits and the ancestors. He argued with Madi about it, accusing him of neglect. Madi shoved him once, hard, and Toru staggered back and kept shouting anyway.

In 507 Toru entered a customary union with Hani. She came from a nearby cluster of houses and moved into Toru’s small yard. They built their own cooking place and stored millet in a clay-lined pit. Toru kept the tools close and checked them every morning, retightening the cord on his axe handle until Hani slapped his hand away. He disliked sitting at group meals and preferred to eat with her and then go out again. In quiet moments he liked roasted mahua flowers and chewed them slowly, watching the sky for birds.

Dry seasons brought trips to the market hamlet on the edge of the plains. Toru carried bundles of fuelwood and forest produce, sometimes leaves used for wrapping. The market men spoke in another tongue, closer to the Prakrit of the plains, and Toru listened with his chin down. He refused to drink with strangers. He kept the smallest copper pieces in a cloth knot at his waist and checked it so often that Hani mocked him at home until he flared and threw the knot at her feet.

In 513 their son, Giru, was born and died before the next new moon. Hani’s milk came in anyway, and she sobbed with anger while Toru stood outside and watched the tree line. He went to Soma, the settlement’s ritual specialist, and demanded a reason. Soma sprinkled rice on a leaf and spoke the names of local spirits tied to the hill and the stream. Toru left unconvinced. After that, he took offense easily. If someone laughed behind him, he assumed it was about his dead child.

Dema died in 515. The household lost its hardest voice and its protection in boundary disputes. Madi stepped into the role, and Toru refused to accept it. He made decisions late, letting weeds thicken before he finally cleared them. He blamed others when the yield came back low. Kora tried to bring him food and counsel, and he took the food without thanks and argued about the counsel.

A second poor monsoon in 517 tightened everything. People from the plains came farther into the forest edge for grass and wood. Obligations increased: carrying loads, repairing a track, providing food for men passing through. Toru resented being told where to cut and where not to cut. He started pushing into a contested patch where another hamlet grazed animals and cut poles.

Hani fell ill in 519 and died that cool season. Toru stopped sleeping through the night. He paced, listening for footsteps. He could not keep the household together alone. By 520 he left his yard and took lodging with a work-boss named Ravu, who kept a larger compound and organized labor gangs for hauling, cutting wood, and helping in fields closer to the plains. Ravu fed him and demanded steady work. Toru obeyed when watched and shirked when not, then lied about the hours. Ravu did not beat him, but he spoke to him with contempt and kept him on the margins.

From 519 onward, Toru went more often to the market hamlet, sleeping at its edge with other laborers. Between his thirty-first and thirty-sixth year, small thefts became a regular part of those trips. A knife disappeared from his bedding one night. Another season, a bundle of leaves was half gone by morning. Once, after bargaining with Kema the broker over a measure, he returned to find a coil of cord missing. Toru accused men at random, shouting until someone threatened to hit him. He could never prove anything. He swallowed the losses and grew sharper.

In late dry season of 521, at thirty-four, the forest-edge dispute broke open. On a narrow path back from cutting wood, men from the neighboring hamlet—led by Pala—blocked him. They shouted about stolen grazing and broken custom. Toru answered with insults and reached for his stick. They beat him with fists and light sticks, leaving bruises on his ribs and back and a limp that lasted weeks. When he returned to Ravu’s compound, the other laborers laughed. Ravu kept him, but only for the lowest tasks, and Toru’s anger turned into a wary silence broken by sudden shouting.

Fevers and coughs returned in cycles, especially after the rains. Toru avoided the sick but could not avoid the air in crowded sleeping places. In early 526, in the cool months, he developed a deep cough and chest pain. He tried to keep working for Ravu, then could not carry loads without stopping to breathe. He spent days hunched near the cooking smoke, spitting and wiping his mouth on his forearm. On June 22, 526, he died in Ravu’s compound.

Ravu allowed his kin to take the body. Madi and Kora carried Toru to a clearing near their settlement, washed him, and laid leaf plates with grain and a splash of fermented drink beside him before placing him in the ground and packing the soil down with their heels.
