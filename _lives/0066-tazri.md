# father_occupation: Craft specialist (e.g., leatherworking, metalworking, pottery)
#   serving local needs
# historical_context:
# - event: Year-to-year rainfall variability in a ~160 mm/yr zone causing at least one
#     notably poor pasture/crop year (local scarcity, livestock stress, higher prices,
#     temporary movement to water/pasture)
#   timing: at least once during ages 0–10
# - event: Locust or other pest pressure affecting grasses and any cultivated plots
#     in the wider region (localized but impactful when it occurs)
#   timing: possible anytime during ages 0–10
# - event: Periodic livestock disease episodes (goat/sheep die-offs, reduced milk yields)
#     affecting household nutrition and barter wealth
#   timing: possible anytime during ages 0–10
# - event: Caravan/market network dynamics across the pre-Sahara (occasional increases
#     or decreases in access to salt, metals, textiles) influencing a craft household’s
#     opportunities
#   timing: intermittent across ages 0–10
# household_social_status: Free commoner household of modest means (typical herding/smallholder
#   family)
# household_structure_at_birth: Two-parent married household (mother and father co-resident;
#   nuclear household)
# language: 'Berber (Amazigh) languages (Afroasiatic: Berber branch) as primary/only
#   language'
# literacy: Illiterate (cannot read or write)
# mental_disorder: Anxiety disorder—primarily social anxiety/selective mutism-like impairment
#   (likely exacerbated by stuttering)
# migration: Stayed in the same settlement/local area (no meaningful migration)
# mother_occupation: Household/domestic production + livestock tending (small stock,
#   milking/dairy) as a major regular activity
# narrative_plan:
#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Ider
#     narrative_role: Craft specialist (leather/metal/pottery-like local work). Practical,
#       reputation-conscious, and often tired; generally decent but expects obedience.
#       With Tazri he is protective yet sometimes impatient with her stutter in public
#       situations (market greetings, bargaining), which inadvertently reinforces her
#       social anxiety.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Tafun
#     narrative_role: Household manager and small-stock/dairy work. Warm but stretched
#       by labor and losses; relies on Tazri as a careful helper. Provides comfort rituals
#       (protective formulas, offerings) when Tazri’s anxiety spikes; pushes her gently
#       to speak but also shields her from gossip.
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Masna
#     narrative_role: Not a primary caretaker but an important daily influence (food
#       processing, story-telling, ritual knowledge). She models communal obligations
#       and soft authority; she also frames illness and misfortune through protective
#       rites, shaping Tazri’s coping routines.
#     role: paternal grandmother (nearby, frequent presence)
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 0
#     connection: 'Anchors the whole narrative: Tazri’s world stays within household,
#       nearby wells/fields, and occasional local market visits; any movement is short
#       and tied to her parents.'
#     incident: Stayed in the same settlement/local area (no meaningful migration)
#   - age: 4
#     connection: Becomes clearly visible once she is expected to greet visitors/kin
#       and speak at the market; worsens after episodes of teasing or public correction.
#     incident: Anxiety disorder—primarily social anxiety/selective mutism-like impairment
#       (exacerbated by stuttering)
#   - age: 6
#     connection: A severe but survivable illness leaves her more fearful of breathlessness
#       and night coughing; mother uses household rites and practical care, reinforcing
#       Tazri’s reliance on close family.
#     incident: 'Serious health incident (survived): high-fever respiratory illness
#       episode'
#   - age: 7
#     connection: Reduced milk yields and higher grain scarcity increase household stress;
#       father seeks more barter work, mother stretches rations; Tazri becomes more
#       conscientious and compliant, trying not to 'cause trouble.'
#     incident: Severe economic hardship year (drought/poor pasture) affecting household
#       diet and milk availability
#   - age: 8
#     connection: A busy market period forces more public interaction; Tazri must accompany
#       her mother with dairy or hides, triggering selective mutism episodes and avoidance.
#     incident: Caravan/market network fluctuation that briefly improves or worsens
#       craft demand
#   - age: 10
#     connection: Household becomes tense and vigilant; Tazri increases caretaking tasks
#       and worry, sleeps poorly, and her anxiety intensifies in parallel with grief
#       and fear of illness.
#     incident: Younger brother Yufri’s terminal illness and death
#   - age: 10
#     connection: Late 41 AD; likely during colder months. Links to earlier vulnerability
#       to respiratory illness and to household crowding/care demands during her brother’s
#       sickness.
#     incident: 'Terminal event: acute respiratory infection (pneumonia/bronchitis/influenza-like
#       illness)'
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Ziri
#     prominence: ages 6–10; appears around workshop tasks, market preparation, and
#       gossip about trade conditions
#     relationship: father’s craft partner/neighbor (another artisan or frequent barter
#       associate)
#   - name: Kensa
#     prominence: ages 5–9; sometimes friendly, sometimes a source of pressure/teasing
#       that triggers Tazri’s mutism
#     relationship: peer girl from a nearby household
#   - name: Amar
#     prominence: ages 7–10; represents louder social world; occasionally speaks on
#       Tazri’s behalf in public
#     relationship: older boy/cousin who helps with herding and errands
#   - name: Tihya
#     prominence: ages 6 and 10; involved in household protective rites and advice during
#       children’s sickness
#     relationship: elder woman/ritual specialist (healer-midwife type) consulted during
#       illness years

#   - birth_year: 33
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 33
#     name: Ayyur
#     narrative_role: First younger brother; his brief life becomes an early household
#       grief marker. Tazri is kept away from the sickroom and later remembers whispered
#       talk and her mother’s exhaustion; it deepens her anxiety and carefulness around
#       illness.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 36
#     death_age: 5
#     death_year: 41
#     name: Yufri
#     narrative_role: Second younger brother and the sibling Tazri actually knows. She
#       behaves like a small, quiet helper—watching him, fetching water, trying to soothe
#       him—while also fearing attention and reprimand. His death in 41 is a late emotional
#       weight that frames her last months.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Adults see her as 'good' and reliable; peers may see her as easy
#       to push around, increasing her avoidance and reinforcing her quietness.
#     scene: When another child is blamed for spilled milk or a broken vessel, Tazri
#       quietly takes extra chores and tries to smooth the conflict rather than argue;
#       she offers her own small share first when food is scarce.
#     timing: ages 6–9 (especially during the hardship year)
#     trait: Very high Agreeableness (96th) + high Honesty-Humility (91st)
#   - consequence: She avoids public spaces, is kept close to home tasks, and misses
#       chances to build broader peer ties; family members sometimes speak for her.
#     scene: At the market or when guests arrive, she freezes—eyes down, throat tight—unable
#       to complete greetings; stuttering worsens under attention. She speaks more freely
#       only with mother/brother in private.
#     timing: ages 4–10 (peaks ages 8–10)
#     trait: High Neuroticism (84th) with social anxiety/selective mutism
#   - consequence: Reputation as quiet/shy; reduces social buffers when teased, intensifying
#       reliance on immediate family.
#     scene: She prefers solitary, repetitive work (sorting dung fuel, watching kids
#       near the doorway, tending a tethered goat) and withdraws from games; she listens
#       more than she speaks.
#     timing: ages 5–10
#     trait: Very low Extraversion (13th)
#   - consequence: Greater distress during market-crowd days and during any talk of
#       traveling to distant kin; reinforces 'home-bound' pattern.
#     scene: She resists unfamiliar foods/practices brought by travelers and is uneasy
#       with new faces; she prefers known routines and the household’s customary rites.
#     timing: ages 7–9
#     trait: Low Openness (17th)
#   - consequence: Adults trust her with responsibilities earlier than typical; also
#       fuels anxiety (perfectionism/fear of mistakes).
#     scene: She methodically checks the goats’ tether knots, remembers to cover milk,
#       and repeats tasks until 'right'; she is careful with her father’s tools and
#       hides, afraid to cause loss.
#     timing: ages 6–10
#     trait: High Conscientiousness (74th)
#   - consequence: Becomes a core trigger for avoidance and selective mutism; shapes
#       how others treat her (protective, impatient, or teasing).
#     scene: Speech blocks appear most when she must speak to non-kin; she uses gestures,
#       whispers to mother, or rehearses phrases beforehand. Family may interpret it
#       as shyness or a 'tongue-tie' needing protective rites.
#     timing: visible from earliest speech; narratively highlighted ages 3–10
#     trait: Congenital stuttering
#   - consequence: Adults keep her on concrete tasks rather than negotiating roles;
#       increases her fear of being 'tested' in public.
#     scene: She learns practical routines well but struggles with complex bargaining
#       talk or remembering multi-step instructions delivered quickly, especially under
#       stress.
#     timing: ages 7–10
#     trait: Lower intelligence (24th percentile) without intellectual disability
# number_of_siblings: '2'
# religion: Indigenous Amazigh household/community rites (ancestor veneration, local
#   spirits, protective/curative rituals; seasonal offerings and communal ceremonies)

Tazri was born in early February of 31 in a small Amazigh settlement on the dry steppe edge above the Guir valley. Her family spoke a Berber tongue and marked the year with local rites: milk poured on a flat stone at the edge of the yard, bits of fat set into a small fire, and names of dead kin spoken aloud for protection. News of coastal rulers and Roman demands reached them as talk carried by traders; power sat with local lineages and the men who could gather followers.

Her father, Ider, worked at a craft that stayed close to home. He cured hides, mended straps, shaped small goods that traveled by barter. Her mother, Tafun, kept goats, milked at dawn, and boiled milk down or made sour curds. Ider's mother Masna lived nearby and came most days to help with food and children; she told stories of dead kin and taught Tazri which offerings kept sickness away. Tazri trailed behind Tafun, quiet and careful, hands busy with tether knots and bowls. When she tried to speak to visitors, her words caught. The blocking and repeats brought hard looks from strangers. She stopped trying and pointed instead, pressing her face against her mother's hip.

Ayyur was born when she was two. He died before his first winter ended. Tafun washed the tiny body, and Masna placed a pinch of salt and a tuft of wool beside him before the men carried him out. Tazri learned to watch sick people from a doorway and to keep still.

Yufri arrived when she was five. Tazri carried him on her back while Tafun milked. She preferred him to other children—he did not expect her to speak.

In her sixth year she caught a bad fever and cough. Masna rubbed her chest with warmed fat and stayed through the worst nights. Tazri survived, but afterward she slept lightly and panicked when breath sounded wrong in the dark.

At seven, a dry year shrank pasture and milk. Ider took more work at the market, and Tazri stretched meals by bringing in wild seed heads and keeping goats from wasting strength.

When caravan traffic surged in her eighth year, the market filled. Ziri, Ider’s craft partner, pushed her to hand over goods and answer greetings. Her throat locked and only a whisper came out. Kensa laughed once; Tazri never followed her to play again.

In 41, Yufri fell sick. Tazri helped Tafun rinse cloths and fetch water while Ider went for the healer. She sat with her brother through the nights, her hand on his chest to feel whether he still breathed. He died at five. Tazri spoke to no one but her mother for days.

That winter, in the cold weeks after Yufri's burial, Tazri caught a chest illness. Tihya came again and rubbed her with warmed fat. Masna murmured protective words over a bowl of milk. Ider sat outside the doorway, unable to watch another child struggle for breath. Tazri died in mid-December. Her family wrapped her in cloth and placed her in a shallow grave outside the settlement, setting a small cup of curds and a scrap of dyed wool beside her.

<!--
**Issues found:**
- [Pass 2] Masna (grandmother) described as "daily influence" in debug data but only appeared once at Ayyur's death
- [Pass 4] Ider (father) disappeared after market scene—absent from Tazri's death scene
- [Pass 7] Paragraph 4 crammed three time periods (age 5, 6, 7) into single dense paragraph
- [Pass 14] Connection between caring for sick Yufri and Tazri catching illness was unclear
- [Pass 14] Yufri's death and Tazri's death rushed together without emotional weight

**Changes made:**
- Added Masna's daily presence to household description (helping with food, telling stories, teaching protective rites)
- Added Masna caring for Tazri during her age-6 fever, and present at her death
- Split paragraph 4 into three: Yufri's arrival, the age-6 illness, and the dry year at age 7
- Added sentence about Tazri's bond with Yufri ("She preferred him to other children—he did not expect her to speak")
- Expanded Yufri's death scene: Tazri sitting with him through nights, her hand on his chest, her silence afterward
- Made connection to her own illness explicit ("in the cold weeks after Yufri's burial")
- Added Ider's presence at Tazri's death ("sat outside the doorway, unable to watch another child struggle for breath")
