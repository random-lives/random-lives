#       her future partner.
#     incident: sexual_violence
#   - age: 23
#     connection: Begins after first birth and the stress of infant illness/death; escalates
#       during scarcity arguments, later constrained by kin pressure and Hani’s rising
#       standing.
#     incident: domestic_violence
#   - age: 27
#     connection: Loss of basket/tool bundle increases workload and reinforces her carefulness;
#       also sparks social suspicion between visiting groups, affecting how she navigates
#       inter-band contact.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 29
#     connection: Physically weakens her temporarily and increases reliance on older
#       women; becomes a turning point where she deepens hearth-protective practices
#       and becomes more controlling about pacing travel.
#     incident: pregnancy_complications
#   - age: 32
#     connection: Sustained shortage forces relocation and tests kin reciprocity; provides

#     incident: major_achievement
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-7
#     key_events:
#     - Father’s death and lingering absence becomes part of household story; maternal
#       kin step in with food and protection (-8693; Hani age 3).
#     - Grandmother Rina’s hearth-protective routines become central to Hani’s sense
#       of safety (ages 4-7).
#     - Infant sister Aki is born and dies the same year, shaping the family’s mourning
#       practices (-8692; Hani age 4).
#     phase: early_childhood
#   - age_range: 8-17
#     key_events:
#     - Kori trains Hani in traps, trail reading, and safe river crossings; Hani becomes
#       an eager but anxious learner (ages 9-15).
#     - Joint-camp gathering with another band ends with sexual coercion; Hani keeps
#       silent to avoid inter-group conflict (age 16-17; year -8680 to -8679).
#     - Transition into adult work and early courtship ties; first sustained pairing
#       with Tora begins soon after (age 17-18; around -8679/-8678).
#     phase: later_childhood_adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-31
#     key_events:
#     - Partnership consolidates; first child Yana is born then dies in infancy (-8673
#       to -8672; Hani age 23-24).
#     - Domestic violence begins to recur during disputes about sharing and jealousy
#       (ages 23-31; starting -8673).
#     - Victim of property theft at a seasonal camp near a travel corridor; adapts by
#       making new gear and tightening her routines (age 27; year -8669).
#     - Pregnancy complication with late loss and heavy bleeding; extended recovery
#       with older women’s care (age 29-30; year -8667/-8666).
#     phase: adult_life_early
#   - age_range: 32-40
#     key_events:
#     - Sustained subsistence crisis over difficult wet seasons; household relies on
#       maternal kin gifts and relocates away from a familiar camp (ages 32-34; -8664
#       to -8662).
#     - Brother Kori dies (if not already placed earlier in timeline) and later uncle
#       Sari dies, reducing protective allies (Kori already dead by -8669; Sari dies
#       -8662).
#     - Domestic violence continues but becomes more managed as kin intervene and Hani’s
#       competence becomes indispensable (ages 35-38).
#     phase: adult_life_mid
#   - age_range: 41-50
#     key_events:

#     death_age: 35
#     death_year: -8652
#     name: Tali
#     narrative_role: Younger brother; impulsive and competitive. Alternates between
#       admiration for Hani’s skills and resentment over her influence; his death in
#       adulthood tightens kin resources.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Sometimes strains relationships (seen as 'too worried'), but also
#       reduces risk in travel and makes her valuable in planning during the wet-season
#       crisis.
#     scene: Checks the sky, water, and paths repeatedly; insists on extra firewood
#       and backup routes; wakes early to listen for animals/strangers, especially after
#       the adolescent assault and after infant loss.
#     timing: adolescence through later adulthood (ages 16-50)
#     trait: Neuroticism (94th percentile)
#   - consequence: Builds a broad support net that helps during shortages and increases
#       her later-life recognition and influence.
#     scene: Talks easily at shared hearths, organizes group gathering parties, mediates
#       small disputes, and maintains exchange friendships with nearby camps despite
#       anxiety.
#     timing: late adolescence onward (ages 18-49)
#     trait: Extraversion (72nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Occasional resentment from others, but also stronger household survival;
#       later she learns to convert this into leadership by sharing strategically.
#     scene: Keeps her best information about reliable patches and trap lines close
#       at first; uses sharp persuasion and selective sharing to secure resources for
#       her children and maternal kin.
#     timing: adult life, especially during and after crises (ages 27-40)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility low (24th percentile)
#   - consequence: Initial friction when the group must relocate; later, her preference
#       for tested routines makes her a stabilizing figure.
#     scene: Skeptical of unfamiliar rituals and new routes; prefers known camps and
#       proven foods, resisting experimentation unless forced by scarcity.
#     timing: childhood through mid-adulthood (ages 8-40)
#     trait: Low Openness (12th percentile)
#   - consequence: Supports her rise to respected status and ability to teach others;
#       helps household navigate the multi-year shortage.
#     scene: Rapidly learns micro-landmarks, seasons of plant ripening, and trap placement;
#       makes efficient tools and improves carrying solutions after theft.
#     timing: childhood learning (ages 9-15) and adult competence (ages 23-49)
#     trait: High Intelligence (86th percentile)
# number_of_children: '4'
# number_of_siblings: '5'
# occupation: General forager-allrounder (gathering plus substantial small-game hunting/trapping
#   and occasional fishing)
# religion: Household/encampment ritual and protective practices (hearth-focused rites,

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During a seasonal camp near a well-used trail between valleys, someone from
#     another visiting group took her best carrying basket and a hide-wrapped bundle
#     of stone flakes and cordage while most adults were away gathering; the items were
#     never recovered and she had to improvise a new carrier from fiber and bark.
#   reasoning: Material possessions were limited and sharing norms were strong, but
#     theft of valued items/food can occur within camps or between groups; overall opportunity
#     is moderate.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: single event; age 27
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: Over an unusually difficult wet season followed by poor foraging returns,
#     her household repeatedly ran short of dried foods and usable fuel, and they were
#     forced to abandon a familiar camp area and rely heavily on loans/gifts of meat
#     and roots from maternal kin until conditions improved.
#   reasoning: There is no money/debt, but severe subsistence crises (loss of access
#     to key resources, near-starvation, loss of shelter/gear) are common enough over
#     50 years in a variable environment.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: sustained period; ages 32–34
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: After years of proving herself as a steady allround forager, she became the
#     person others followed to locate dependable plant patches and small-game trap
#     lines, and she was asked to lead younger women on gathering trips and to decide
#     how food was divided at the hearth during large camp gatherings.
#   reasoning: In egalitarian societies, formal recognition is limited, but becoming
#     a respected older adult and skilled forager can still constitute notable social
#     success; truly standout achievements remain uncommon.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: sustained recognition; ages 41–49
#   type: major_achievement
# - event: As a late adolescent during a joint camp with another band, an older man
#     cornered and coerced her into sex while others were away, and she kept quiet afterward
#     to avoid conflict between groups and because blame would likely fall on her.
#   reasoning: Sexual coercion can occur in small-scale societies (within camps, during
#     raids, or through power imbalances), and women’s lifetime exposure risk is non-trivial
#     over 50 years.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: single event; age 16–17
#   type: sexual_violence
# - event: In her long-term partnership, arguments—often about food sharing and jealousy—sometimes
#     escalated into her partner striking or pushing her, leaving bruises and at least
#     once forcing her to sleep apart with her kin for several nights before reconciliation.
#   reasoning: Intimate partner violence is a common form of violence against women
#     cross-culturally; being in at least one long-term pair-bond creates sustained
#     exposure even without formal institutions to intervene.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: recurring pattern; ages 23–38
#   type: domestic_violence
# - event: One pregnancy ended late with heavy bleeding and severe weakness; she survived
#     with intensive care from older women (warmth, fluids/broths, and rest), but the
#     baby did not live and she needed weeks before she could travel and forage normally
#     again.
#   reasoning: With four live births and high background obstetric risk in premodern
#     conditions, miscarriage/stillbirth or a serious complication at some point is
#     fairly likely even if not recorded among live births.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: single severe episode; age 29–30
#   type: pregnancy_complications
---

Hani was born into a small foraging band that moved between high ridges and sheltered valleys in the northern Andean–Caribbean corridor. People spoke a Chibchan tongue no one wrote down. No chiefs governed them; decisions came from elders and from whoever could persuade others at the hearth. At her family’s fire, daily ritual was practical: a pinch of crushed leaves into the flames before a journey, the first bite of roasted tuber set aside on a flat stone for the spirits of the place, quiet words to the dead before sleep.

Her mother, Mina, kept a mother-centered household tied tightly to her own relatives. Hani’s father, Pera, was only a story. When Hani was three, he died away from camp, and the news arrived with men who carried a bundle of his things and little else. After that, Mina leaned on her mother Rina and on her brother Sari. Meat appeared at their hearth when Sari returned from a hunt; cordage and baskets appeared when Rina sat by the fire and worked fiber through her fingers.

Hani grew up between an older brother and a cluster of younger siblings. Kori, three years older, acted like an extra parent when Mina’s hands were full. He showed Hani where to step on slick rock, how to read crushed grass on a game trail, how to set a small snare without leaving her scent on the loop. Hani watched everything. She remembered the shape of every bend in the path and the timing of rain clouds over certain ridges. She also asked for reassurance again and again—whether the basket was tied well enough, whether the fire would last the night, whether strangers would return.

When she was four, Mina gave birth again. Aki lived only briefly. Rina wrapped the tiny body in soft fiber and tucked it in a shallow hollow under stones near a stand of trees. That evening, Mina fed the fire with extra fuel and placed a strip of roasted meat to the side for the dead. Hani took the lesson seriously. After that, she kept small habits: tapping the hearthstone before sleeping, counting children by touch in the dark.

More children followed. Luma was born when Hani was seven, a practical girl who cried less than the others. Tali came two years later, a boy who fussed and grabbed and had to be watched near the fire.

Rina died when Hani was eighteen. Before that, the grandmother had been the one who sat with Hani when she woke shaking from a bad dream, pulling her close and making her breathe with the crackle of the fire. Rina also pushed her. “Go,” she would say, sending Hani on short errands alone, then longer ones, until Hani could return from a gathering patch without looking over her shoulder every few steps.

At sixteen, during a joint camp with another band, Hani experienced the first event she never spoke about. One afternoon, while most people were away gathering, an older man named Pani cornered her behind piled brush and forced her. Hani went back to the hearth with dirt on her knees and kept her face still. She washed in cold water and said she had slipped. She avoided being alone near strangers after that, and she started choosing work that kept her in groups.

Kori’s training made her useful. At nineteen she walked trap lines with him and her sister Suna, carrying a short club and a basket. She could bring back lizards, eggs, and small mammals, and she could find plant foods other people missed. She liked one particular patch of edible roots in a damp hollow, and she liked the early morning before talk started, when only smoke and footsteps moved around camp. She also liked teasing. When Kori exaggerated his hunting stories, Hani pulled faces at Suna behind his back until Suna snorted and coughed on her food.

Hani began her long partnership with Tora when she was twenty-two. He traveled between camps easily and carried himself like someone who expected to be listened to. He made her laugh in the first months, and he brought her a better-edged stone point than she had. They built a shared hearth space within the larger camp and worked well when the days were easy—he with hunts and heavier loads, she with gathering, traps, and steady provisioning.

Their first child, Yana, was born when Hani was twenty-three. The baby clung to Mina’s old woven sling as Hani walked. At one year old, Yana fell ill during a spell of damp weather and died quickly. Hani placed small food portions by the hearth for several nights afterward, each one measured and exact. Her sleep became lighter. She woke to small noises and kept checking her remaining supplies.

The partnership with Tora changed after Yana’s death. That same year, during an argument about sharing meat with visiting relatives, he shoved Hani hard enough that she hit the ground and scraped her elbow. It happened again in other forms: a strike when he accused her of listening too closely to another man’s jokes, a push that left bruises on her upper arm. Once, when she was twenty-six, she moved to Mina’s side of the camp for several nights with her sisters, sleeping with her back to a tree while the women kept the fire burning.

Hani did not become quiet. She spoke up in group discussions and argued about where to camp and when to move. She also kept certain advantages close. When she found a new trap run or a patch of ripe fruit, she told her sisters first and waited before mentioning it to others. It brought food to her hearth and tightened her bond with Mina's family.

When she was twenty-six, she gave birth to a daughter, Niri.

At twenty-seven, during a seasonal camp near a well-used trail between valleys, someone stole from her. Hani returned from gathering to find her best carrying basket gone and a hide-wrapped bundle missing—stone flakes she used for quick cutting and cordage she had twisted and dried. Visitors had been in camp, and nobody admitted anything. Hani confronted one woman sharply, then stopped and pulled herself back before the argument turned into an open fight. That night she sat with Rina's old fiber-working stone and started again, stripping bark and twisting it into new cord. She made a new carrier with a wider strap so it would not cut into her shoulder. After that, she slept with valuables tucked under her head.

Kori died that same year, at thirty. He had gone ahead on a hunt and did not return. The others found him at the bottom of a rocky slope, his leg bent wrong beneath him. He had fallen and broken something vital, and the cold had finished him before help arrived. Hani kept his best snare cord wrapped in hide at the bottom of her carrying load.

Three years after Niri came Maya, and by thirty-two she had a son, Omi. Between those births, at twenty-nine, Hani suffered a pregnancy loss that nearly killed her. Heavy bleeding started late and did not stop. Older women, led by Seki, kept her warm and fed her thin broths. They packed soft material between her legs and changed it again and again. Hani stayed flat on her back for days, furious at her own body and frightened of moving. The baby did not live. For weeks afterward she refused to carry heavy loads and insisted on shorter travel days, even when others complained.

At thirty-two the wet season became a problem that did not end. Fires struggled. Dry stores ran low. Traps yielded less, and fruiting patches failed. The household moved away from a familiar camp to find better shelter and relied on Mina's brother Sari for gifts of meat and on Luma's work to stretch gathered foods. Hani pressed hard for rationing. She counted portions, measured out dried roots, and stopped Tora from giving away more than she thought safe. A woman from a neighboring camp, Noka, had clashed with Hani before over food-sharing disputes, but during the worst of the shortage Noka brought dried tubers and shared them without asking for immediate return. After that, the two worked together when camps overlapped. The arguments with Tora sharpened; he struck her once in front of her sister, and Luma stepped between them, shouting until others turned to look. After that, the violence did not disappear, but it became rarer and more hidden.

Sari died when Hani was thirty-four. With both him and Kori gone, the margin of safety around Mina's descendants had narrowed. Hani responded by widening her network herself. She talked more with other households, traded labor for meat, and learned who would share when asked directly.

Tali died when Hani was forty-four. He had grown into a restless man, quick to join hunts far from camp and slow to share what he brought back. A gut illness took him over several days, and he was buried near a stand of trees along a route he used to walk.

Mina died when Hani was forty-six. By then Hani's daughters were nearly grown, and the household had become an extended cluster: Hani and Tora, their children, and close family in adjacent shelters. Hani took on more authority as an older woman. She led younger women, including Ula, to dependable patches and trap lines. She insisted on carrying spare cordage and on marking routes with small, agreed signs. At large gatherings she sat near the hearth and portioned food, cutting strips evenly and handing the first piece to an elder before children were fed. She liked the moments after a successful day when smoke rose straight up and the best tubers roasted in the coals. She told short stories then, often at Kori's expense, and laughed loudly when others took the bait.

Maya died when Hani was forty-nine. Her second daughter had been healthy and strong, but a fever swept through the camp that season and she could not shake it. Hani buried her near the stand of trees where Aki had been placed decades before. She still led gathering trips that year, still spoke in discussion, but she started insisting on walking last in the line so she could count who was behind.

Suna died the following year, her body worn from years of hard work. The sisters had shared labor since childhood, and after her loss Hani moved through camp with less ease.

The injury that killed Hani came that same year. Hani fell on a steep, wet slope while traveling with others and landed badly. She managed to reach camp with help, but her leg swelled and the skin broke. Seki cleaned it, and the women kept her close to the fire, feeding her broth and soft foods. The wound turned foul. Hani remained sharp-tongued even then, ordering where things should be placed and scolding Tora for leaving a tool too near the sleeping area. She died at fifty.

Her family placed her body in a shallow grave on a rise above camp, wrapped in hides. They set a small bundle beside her—cordage, a stone flake, and a pinch of dried roots—and they fed the hearth that night with extra fuel before the camp moved on.

<!-- CHANGELOG
- Fixed Suna's death timing: narrative said Suna and Maya both died when Hani was 49, but frontmatter shows Suna died in -8646 (Hani age 50, same year as Hani's death) while Maya died in -8647 (Hani age 49). Separated the deaths into two paragraphs with correct timing.
- Added missing character Noka: frontmatter listed her as rival/ally prominent ages 26-35, but she was absent from narrative. Added her to the wet-season crisis (ages 32-34) where she transitions from rival to ally by sharing food during the shortage.
- Clarified death sequence: changed "the next year" to "that same year" to reflect that both Suna and Hani died in -8646.
