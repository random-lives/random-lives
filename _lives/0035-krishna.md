Krishna was born on a wet June day in 1255 in the western Brahmaputra valley, where the ground stayed low and the water decided what could stand. In summer the air was hot and heavy. In winter the mornings came cold enough that the bamboo walls felt damp to the touch. Behind the fields the semi-evergreen trees held on through the dry months, and people kept to raised paths that had been built up and repaired for longer than anyone could name.

His household was a stem family. His father worked a small rice holding, enough in a good year to feed the house and still spare grain for dues when a collector came. His mother ran the yard and the hearth and the work that never ended: soaking paddy, parching it, pounding it, winnowing it. His paternal grandfather lived with them too, an old man with thin legs and a steady stare who sat near the doorway and watched the sky and the children in the same quiet way.

Before Krishna there had been girls. Two were buried as infants. One sister lived and grew to adulthood. Krishna arrived third and became the first son. After that, people spoke more openly about who would take the field work when his father’s back failed.

He learned his first words in the valley’s local speech. He never learned letters. In his village, writing belonged to temple men, to scribes who kept a chief’s accounts, and to a few traders who marked debts and measures. Krishna’s own measures were plain: a basket’s weight, the height of floodwater on a post, the depth of a beel when the rains began to weaken.

He grew up noisy and forward. He followed older men to the water when he was told to stay back and kept talking until someone snapped at him. He forgot small instructions. He left a sickle out in the rain and then acted as if it was nothing when the blade pitted. When he weeded, his line drifted and he blamed the ground. His mother corrected him while she worked. His father’s temper came fast and then shut down into silence.

By the time Krishna could work full days, the river had already taught him that rice was never certain. In his teens the monsoon came wrong. The first rains hit hard and early, then stopped. Seedlings yellowed in some plots and drowned in others where water sat too long. Grain ran short. The household ate more fish and greens from the wet margins, and Krishna spent days in the shallows with mud up his calves, feeling for movement with his feet and hands while older men set traps and checked them again and again. That season pushed him toward the floodplain.

His father still called himself a cultivator, but Krishna put more of his time into fishing and foraging because it brought food and small money fast. Fish could be sold at the weekly market. A good catch could be swapped for salt, oil, and iron hooks. He liked the bazaar for the noise and the crowd. He learned who shaved weights and who did not. He also learned that a quick tongue could get him out of trouble.

He used that too much. If a neighbor lent him a net needle or a coil of line, he returned it late or returned it worn and looked offended when challenged. If families had agreed that one stretch of water was for one man’s traps that night, Krishna edged into it when he thought no one was watching. He was not gentle, and he was not careful. He took what he could and, when caught, laughed and asked to be forgiven. The elders did not drive him off the water, but they watched him closely. When arguments were brought to them, they listened longer to the other man.

He married as a young adult by arrangement. His wife moved into his father’s compound. She kept the stores counted and the borrowed things returned on time. She spoke less than he did and remembered more. When Krishna came home with cowries from fish sales, she did not grab at them. She waited until he asked for lamp oil or a tool repaired, then asked what he had earned and what he had already spent. Sometimes he lied. When he lied too often, she stopped speaking to him and did her work in silence until he became restless and tried to turn it into a joke.

As Krishna got older, the chief’s demands tightened. Agents came more often, counting not only rice but dried fish as well. Men were called for labor on raised paths and embankments, and for hauling timber to strengthen a stockade on higher ground. Krishna hated the work parties. He arrived late, made jokes while others lifted, and wandered off when the overseer looked away. Once the overseer caught him and dragged him back by the forearm in front of the line. Krishna swallowed his anger and worked until the call ended. Afterward he complained loudly in the courtyard about how the chief took and took. His father told him to keep his voice down. Krishna did not.

In his thirties a storm cost him his gear. He was on the water with another man in a narrow boat, both standing to work a net across a channel where fish moved at dusk. Wind came up fast from the east and pushed chop across the surface. The other man wanted to turn in and wait. Krishna insisted on one more pass. The wind took the net and pulled it sideways. The boat swung. They kept it upright, but the net snagged below and tore when they tried to free it. Two floats broke loose and were gone in the dark. On shore, Krishna talked fast, blaming the wind and the channel. The other man said nothing and walked away.

Replacing the net was beyond him. Krishna went to a better-off household and asked for an advance: cowries and a length of cloth to trade, against his next catches. The man agreed only after Krishna’s wife came with him and spoke plainly about what would be repaid and when. Krishna stood there and let her do it. He paid the advance back in pieces over months and argued about every part of it.

His children were born into the same compound where he had been born. A son came first, then daughters. Two girls died as infants. One lived long enough to talk and carry small loads and follow her mother through the yard, then she died too. The son grew into a lean young man and went with Krishna to the water, learning the same channels and the same habits. The surviving daughter reached fifteen while Krishna was still alive, already doing adult work around the house and field edges. Krishna liked her company because she laughed at his stories and did not question him the way his wife did.

By September of 1298 Krishna was forty-three, broad shouldered from hauling nets and punting through shallow channels. The monsoon had begun to retreat, but the river still ran high and fast. Mornings came clear and the afternoons could turn quickly.

That day he went out with the boat loaded light: a basket, a pole, coils of line, and a net patched too many times. He planned to be back before dusk. From the bank the current looked manageable. He pushed into it standing, calling back to another fisher on shore as if he had all the time in the world.

A submerged log struck the side of the boat. The hull jolted and his weight shifted. He tried to brace with the pole, but the tip slid on wet wood. The boat rolled and took water at once. Krishna grabbed the gunwale, then grabbed at the net as it tangled. He went over.

Men on the bank ran and shouted his name. Krishna surfaced once, mouth open, arms wide and uncoordinated. The current pulled him downstream into reeds and floating grass. He did not come up again.
