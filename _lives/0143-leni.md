# ethnicity: Highlands Papuan-speaking horticulturalist (Central Range/Eastern Highlands
#   cultural sphere)
# father_occupation: Community organizer/“big-man” type (exchange/feast coordination,
#   dispute leadership) alongside gardening
# historical_context:
# - event: ENSO-driven climate variability causing irregular seasons (some years unusually
#     wet with landslides, other years drier with poor garden yields), affecting taro/yam/banana
#     productivity and pig feeding
#   timing: intermittent across life; especially ages 5–10 and 22–27
# - event: Expansion/intensification of long-distance exchange networks (movement of
#     valued stone axes, obsidian, shells/pig products), increasing obligations to contribute
#     food/pigs and attend compensations/feasts
#   timing: gradual background trend; felt most in adulthood ages 18–35
# - event: Introduction/spread of new horticultural techniques or crop varieties within
#     the Highlands (e.g., improved mound/ditch practices, new planting material shared
#     through kin and exchange ties), subtly changing labor patterns and yields
#   timing: slow diffusion; any time, most likely ages 8–25
# household_social_status: Outsider/recent-migrant household (less secure claims and

#   - death_year: -1337
#     name: Wari
#     narrative_role: 'A community organizer/big-man type alongside gardening; teaches
#       Leni the logic of obligations and the leverage of pigs. Relationship is conditional:
#       pride when she is useful, sharp correction when she embarrasses the household.'
#     role: father
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Hani
#     narrative_role: Primary caregiver and manager of pigs/food reciprocity; models
#       relentless routine work and strategic giving. Warm in protection, unsentimental
#       in discipline; remains a practical support during Leni’s widowhood.
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: -1330
#     name: Bora
#     narrative_role: Helps integrate the outsider household into local networks; occasionally
#       mediates disputes. Leni learns from him how compensation is negotiated and how
#       anger is turned into exchange.
#     role: paternal uncle (adjacent caretaker/mentor)
#   children:
#   - birth_year: -1344
#     death_age: 46
#     death_year: -1298
#     name: Kena
#     narrative_role: Firstborn; as a boy is trained toward men’s work and exchange;
#       as he grows, becomes both a source of pride and a bargaining chip in kin politics.
#       Too young to be household head when his father dies, so Leni must hold things
#       together.

#   - birth_year: -1342
#     death_age: 67
#     death_year: -1275
#     name: Yana
#     narrative_role: Daughter who learns pig and garden work at her mother’s elbow;
#       later becomes the one who remembers Leni’s methods and sharp tongue most clearly,
#       carrying the family’s reputation into the next generation.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -1340
#     death_age: 54
#     death_year: -1286
#     name: Mori
#     narrative_role: Youngest; small during the period of domestic conflict and his
#       father’s illness. Leni is fiercely protective yet demanding, shaping him into
#       a careful worker who values security.
#     sex: M
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 16
#     connection: Occurs during adolescence when she is trusted to travel to distant
#       gardens; afterward she becomes more route-conscious and controlling about who
#       accompanies her—this foreshadows her later tight management style.
#     incident: sexual_violence
#   - age: 20
#     connection: Begins after the first child, when resource pressure and exchange
#       obligations rise; her competence and sharp tongue collide with her husband’s
#       status concerns, escalating into a recurring pattern through age 27.
#     incident: domestic_violence
#   - age: 27
#     connection: Domestic violence eases as Toma becomes debilitated; Leni’s high conscientiousness
#       shifts from 'managing against him' to 'keeping him alive,' while also protecting
#       her children’s future claims.
#     incident: sick_relative
#   - age: 29
#     connection: During the caregiving period and just after widowhood, thin pigs and
#       looming exchanges drive a calculated, covert act; it ties to her very low honesty-humility
#       and high intelligence (plausible cover story) and triggers a compensation settlement
#       mediated by kin.
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6
#     key_events:
#     - Learns household routines (firekeeping, carrying, watching pigs) as firstborn
#       while parents build acceptance in a new place.
#     - Experiences two infant sibling deaths (Sina, later Nali), shaping a household
#       atmosphere of vigilance and taboo-observance.
#     - A run of irregular seasons (very wet then unexpectedly dry years) forces more
#       time in gardens and reliance on careful food storage.
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 7-17
#     key_events:
#     - 'Apprentices into exchange provisioning: learns counting-by-portion, who must
#       be fed first, and how to conceal reserves.'
#     - New garden techniques/planting material spread through the area; she adopts
#       them quickly and outperforms peers in planning and labor.
#     - Sexual violence occurs on a forest path; afterward she changes routines and
#       becomes more controlled and guarded.
#     phase: Later childhood & adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-26
#     key_events:
#     - Marriage to Toma consolidates alliances; she moves between hamlet houses and
#       gardens but remains near birth territory.
#     - Birth of three children (Kena, Yana, Mori) in quick succession; she becomes
#       central to pig feeding and feast preparation.
#     - Domestic violence becomes recurring during disputes about pigs/food distribution
#       and perceived disrespect.
#     phase: Early adult / marriage & young children
#   - age_range: 27-35
#     key_events:
#     - Toma develops a long wasting illness; Leni manages caregiving while maintaining
#       gardens and pigs, and attending exchange obligations via proxies.
#     - After Toma’s death, Leni runs a widow-headed household with dependent children;
#       her standing is 'ordinary/accepted' rather than marginal.
#     - Perpetrator property crime episode (piglet moved/claimed) during a lean season;
#       compensation is arranged to prevent escalation.
#     - Leni’s own chronic illness progresses (wasting/parasite burden or TB-like condition),
#       culminating in death at 35.
#     phase: Later adult / widowhood & chronic strain
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Rina
#     prominence: ages 18-35; sometimes collaborator in garden work, sometimes rival
#       in exchange standing; connected to gossip around pig numbers.
#     relationship: neighbor woman and exchange counterpart
#   - name: Kalo
#     prominence: age 16-17; later exists as an avoided presence/rumor rather than an
#       ongoing personal relationship
#     relationship: man from another local group (assailant in the sexual violence incident)
#   - name: Sali
#     prominence: ages 5-20; advises on taboos for infant protection and garden fertility;
#       provides culturally grounded interpretation after misfortunes
#     relationship: older female relative/ritual-knowledge holder (aunt-like figure)
#   - name: Pina
#     prominence: ages 25-31; helps settle the piglet dispute and keeps it from escalating
#       into inter-hamlet conflict
#     relationship: local mediator/compensation negotiator allied to her father’s network
#   partners:
#   - name: Toma
#     narrative_role: Husband from a nearby allied hamlet; marriage begins as a practical
#       alliance. Relationship becomes conflict-heavy with repeated beatings over pig
#       and food management; later he develops a wasting cough and Leni becomes his
#       caregiver until his death.

#     name: Leni
#     narrative_role: Eldest; grows up carrying responsibility early, learns the rules

#     death_age: 24
#     death_year: -1336
#     name: Karo
#     narrative_role: Only surviving brother; alternates between ally and rival—he expects
#       deference as a man yet relies on Leni’s labor and sharp planning; his presence
#       helps the household be accepted locally.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: -1358
#     death_age: 19
#     death_year: -1339
#     name: Mali
#     narrative_role: Younger sister close in age; confidante in girlhood garden work;
#       her early adult death tightens Leni’s sense that kin can vanish quickly and
#       hardens her practicality.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -1356
#     death_age: 30
#     death_year: -1326
#     name: Tina
#     narrative_role: Younger sister who stays near the same hamlet; often judges Leni’s

#       occasional help yet also resents demands.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -1354
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: -1354
#     name: Nali
#     narrative_role: Another infant loss; reinforces the family’s emphasis on protective
#       practices and the mother’s relentless attention to food and warmth for surviving
#       children.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Household stability and improved acceptance; also fuels conflict
#       with spouse and envy/suspicion from neighbors.
#     scene: She keeps an exact feeding rotation for pigs (who gets sweet potato, who
#       gets greens), times garden work by rainfall patterns, and insists children repeat
#       tasks until done correctly; she also stockpiles small reserves for exchange
#       emergencies.
#     timing: visible from ages 8-35, strongest during ages 18-35
#     trait: Conscientiousness (97th percentile)
#   - consequence: Becomes a key planner in her household; occasionally crosses ethical
#       lines and risks backlash.
#     scene: She anticipates compensation demands and strategically allocates pigs—sending
#       smaller gifts early to prevent larger claims later; during disputes she frames
#       narratives that redirect blame or reduce penalties.
#     timing: ages 12-35, especially in exchange/feast contexts ages 18-35
#     trait: Intelligence (96th percentile)
#   - consequence: Short-term gains and security; simmering mistrust that requires kin
#       mediation/compensation to contain.
#     scene: She hoards the best planting material, understates her household’s pig
#       numbers, and in the piglet incident uses ambiguity ('it wandered') to appropriate
#       value while testing what others can prove.
#     timing: subtle in youth ages 10-17; overt under stress ages 27-31
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (2nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Seen as competent but 'cold'; fewer friends, more reliance on close
#       kin ties.
#     scene: She avoids loud talk circles and dance displays, speaks little in gatherings,
#       and prefers working alone in gardens at off-peak times; she lets others perform
#       public generosity while she handles logistics.
#     timing: throughout life; notable in adolescence and adulthood
#     trait: Extraversion (11th percentile)
#   - consequence: Higher household output but higher interpersonal friction; contributes
#       to domestic violence dynamics.
#     scene: She is blunt when others are careless with pigs or food, refuses requests
#       she deems wasteful, and escalates arguments rather than smoothing them over—especially
#       with her husband and sister Tina.
#     timing: ages 15-35
#     trait: Agreeableness (16th percentile)
#   - consequence: Others see her as steady; emotional distance can be read as hardness
#       or lack of empathy.
#     scene: During crises (crop shortfall, husband’s decline) she shows little outward
#       panic—she shifts to action, rationing, and planning, and rarely seeks comfort.
#     timing: most visible ages 22-35
#     trait: Neuroticism (10th percentile)
# number_of_children: '3'
# number_of_siblings: '5'
# occupation: Gardening plus primary pig husbandry/exchange provisioning (raising/feeding
#   pigs, managing food for reciprocity/feasts)
# religion: Ancestor/local-spirit rites tied to land and clan (routine offerings/food
#   placement, invocation, taboos around gardens/pigs, life-cycle rites)

# - F
# structured_incidents:
# - event: During a tense season when her household’s pigs were thin and exchange obligations
#     were looming, she quietly moved a neighbor’s small piglet (kept near the edge
#     of the hamlet) into her own pig enclosure at night and later claimed it had wandered
#     in; the dispute simmered until her kin offered a small compensation payment to
#     prevent a wider quarrel.
#   reasoning: Opportunistic taking of food/pigs or boundary/harvest disputes could
#     lead to acts that map to 'theft', and low honesty-humility increases propensity,
#     but strong community sanction limits repeated predation.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 29–30 (one episode with follow-on dispute over several weeks)
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime
# - event: While returning from distant gardens with other women, she was separated
#     on a forest path and coerced into sex by a man from another local group who threatened
#     her with a stone blade and retaliation if she spoke; afterward she avoided that
#     route and her kin treated it as a dangerous intergroup incident rather than something
#     to openly litigate.
#   reasoning: Women faced non-trivial risk of coercion/assault (including within courtship,
#     raids, or by powerful men), though exact rates are uncertain; outsider origins
#     and low social protection early on modestly increase risk.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 16–17 (single assault)
#   type: sexual_violence
# - event: In her marriage, arguments over pig feeding and the distribution of food
#     for an upcoming exchange escalated into beatings—most often when her husband was
#     angry about perceived disrespect or shortfalls; the violence flared repeatedly
#     for years before easing when he became ill.
#   reasoning: Intimate-partner violence is historically widespread; her low agreeableness/very
#     low honesty-humility could increase conflict intensity, and widowhood may follow
#     a high-risk male environment.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 20–27 (recurring pattern)
#   type: domestic_violence
# - event: Her husband developed a long wasting illness with cough and weakness, leaving
#     him unable to clear gardens or walk to exchange gatherings; she took on the work
#     of feeding him, keeping a fire, preparing soft foods, and maintaining pigs and
#     gardens while also managing their children, until he died and her household became
#     widow-headed.
#   reasoning: High infectious and injury burden makes prolonged nursing of a spouse/child/sibling
#     fairly likely; her household became widow-headed, consistent with a period of
#     caring for an ill husband or chronically sick child/kin.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 27–30 (sustained caregiving period)
#   type: sick_relative
---

Leni was born in a small hamlet on the high ridges of the Central Range, where people spoke a Trans–New Guinea tongue and measured security in gardens, pigs, and family ties. No chiefs collected taxes there. Men who could gather followers through exchange and mediation carried influence, and families kept good relations with ancestors and place-spirits through food set out at the edge of gardens, bits of pork fat placed on stones, and spoken names at dusk.

She arrived as the first child of Warim and Hani, a couple still treated as newcomers. Warim had come with a thin web of claims and needed allies. He spent days clearing new ground, then nights talking over hearths—who owed whom, whose anger could be softened, what pig could be promised without shaming his household. Hani worked the gardens and kept the pigs close. Leni learned early that a pig's ribs showing meant trouble later, when someone arrived demanding a share for an old quarrel.

When Leni was two, her mother birthed a girl, Sinap. The baby stayed small and died before the next moon. Hani did not wail for long. She scraped a fresh strip of bark for the sleeping mat and stopped letting smoke die down at night. Leni watched her mother rub leaves on the pig pen posts and murmur to the ancestors named from Hani's side, then to those Warim had brought with him. After that, Hani's rules multiplied: what foods a child could touch, which path could be used after a quarrel, which garden corners needed a pinch of salt and ash placed quietly.

A brother, Karongat, came when Leni was four. He grew fast, and Warim carried him through gatherings, presenting him as proof the household would last. That year the rain came hard and long; slopes slid in places, and trails were slick for weeks. Leni learned to keep firewood under eaves and to split taro corms clean so they would not rot in the damp.

Malit was born when Leni was six, then Tinam two years later. Leni did not treat her sisters gently. She corrected how they tied carrying nets and slapped away careless hands near the pig trough. Hani let it happen. "Teach them," she said, and went back to mounding soil.

Between the births, Leni’s days settled into a strict pattern she imposed on herself. Before the sun touched the ridge, she checked the pig pen, counted by touch the sweet potatoes set aside for feed, and moved the animals so their rooting did not wreck the cooking area. She preferred the hour after dawn, when the hamlet was quiet and only the birds were loud. She avoided the dense talk circles. When laughter rose from a house, she passed by without joining unless her mother sent her.

At ten, she watched another infant sister arrive, Nalip, and die soon after. The women gathered, scraped out the hearth, and placed a small bundle of leaves and cooked tuber near a stone at the garden edge for the ancestors. Leni did not ask questions. She memorized what was done.

As she grew, Warim's work as an organizer brought strangers through: men carrying stone axes with long polish marks, others with dark glassy flakes traded from far places. They spoke different accents but used the same gestures when bargaining. Leni listened from the edge, then later repeated to Hani what each man had promised. Hani tested her by naming a pig and asking what it could buy in return. Leni answered without delay.

At thirteen, when a neighbor woman teased her for keeping the best planting pieces hidden, Leni stared at her and said, flatly, that careless mouths made hungry children. The woman laughed anyway and called her a tight-fisted girl. Leni did not laugh back, but she did start walking with her to the gardens because the woman was quick with a digging stick and did not waste time.

When Leni was sixteen, she walked back from distant gardens with other women. Rain started, then stopped, leaving the path slick and silent. She lagged behind while adjusting a net strap, and the group moved ahead around a bend. A man from another local group stepped onto the path with a stone blade in his hand. He forced her off the trail and coerced her into sex, threatening her with harm if she spoke. Leni returned to the hamlet alone. She washed at the stream without crying, then told her mother a short version: a man, a blade, a place. Hani said nothing for a long time. In the following days, Leni changed her routes. She walked only with others, and when she had to go alone she took a different ridge path even if it cost time.

Warim arranged her marriage when she was nineteen. Tomang, from an allied hamlet, brought small gifts—meat, a shell ornament, a stone blade—enough to signal seriousness but not enough to invite envy. Leni did not smile at him. She checked the pigs offered, noted their condition, and spoke to Hani about feed.

A year later she gave birth to her first child, Kenam. Two years after that came Yanat, then Morik when Leni was twenty-four. The children tied her to the house and gardens. She kept pigs as if they were an accounting system: which animal belonged to future compensation, which animal could be slaughtered to keep peace, which could be loaned out to bind another household. Tomang wanted generosity to be loud and immediate. Leni wanted it timed.

The beatings began when she was twenty. Tomang struck her after arguments about how much food she set aside and which pig she refused to promise. Sometimes it started with a small thing—she corrected him in front of his cousin, or she refused to hand over a portion of pork meant for her children. Tomang hit hard enough to leave bruises on her arms and back. Leni stopped flinching. She carried water, fed pigs, and said little while he paced and shouted. When he was calm, she spoke in short sentences about what the household could afford and what it could not.

Rains failed in Leni's twenty-third year and returned too hard the next season. Gardens suffered, and pigs grew thin. Exchange obligations did not stop. Warim pressed for more contributions to keep alliances steady. Leni responded by tightening rations and working longer. She enjoyed one small pleasure then: roasted pandanus kernels when a tree fruited, eaten alone behind the house while others talked.

Malit died when Leni was twenty-five, from a fever that left her shaking and then still. The hamlet treated it as a misfortune to be managed: a small gathering, cooked taro, pork placed on leaves, the names of ancestors spoken over the body. Leni watched Tinam's face and felt irritation at her sister's loud grief, then turned away and began sorting planting pieces for the next week.

Warim died when Leni was twenty-seven, during an outbreak of fever that swept through several hamlets. He had been organizing a large compensation payment, and his death left debts and promises hanging. Hani and Boram managed most of the arrangements; Leni stayed quiet and kept the pigs fed.

That same year, Tomang developed a long illness. He coughed until his chest hurt and his legs shook when he stood. He stopped walking to gatherings. The violence eased because he lacked strength, and because Leni did not provoke him in public anymore. She shifted to care: keeping a small fire so he stayed warm at night, preparing softer foods, cleaning him, and controlling who entered the house so gossip did not turn into claims. At the same time she kept the gardens productive and the pigs alive, directing Kenam to carry and dig even when he complained.

Karongat, her only brother, died when Leni was twenty-eight. A wound on his leg festered after a garden accident. Leni helped carry food to Karongat's wife and children, though she did not stay long. She said little about the loss.

During that period, when Leni was twenty-nine, she took a piglet from a neighbor's edge pen during a lean season. She moved it at night into her own enclosure and later said it had wandered in. The neighbor protested. Voices rose; men gathered. Leni stayed inside, telling Hani and Boram exactly what to say: uncertainty, then a small concession, then refusal to admit fault. A mediator helped settle it. A small compensation payment—food and a pig portion—went out to keep the quarrel from drawing in allied hamlets.

Tomang died when Leni was thirty. She became the head of her household with three children still dependent. Kenam, at ten, was too young to speak at gatherings; Yanat and Morik were younger still. Leni sent food and small pig gifts through her uncle Boram when she had to. People accepted her as ordinary, present, useful. They no longer called her family newcomers.

Hani, her mother, remained a steady presence—helping with the pigs, watching the younger children when Leni worked distant gardens, offering advice that Leni sometimes took and sometimes ignored. The two women did not talk much, but they worked side by side without friction.

Leni's own illness began to show when she was thirty-one. A cough that would not leave. Weight dropping even when she ate. She kept working anyway, pushing herself through garden tasks and refusing to rest for long. Boram, her father's brother who had helped settle disputes and speak on her behalf, died when Leni was thirty-four. Tinam still came by sometimes, though the two sisters never grew warm.

By thirty-five, Leni could no longer hide her weakness. She spent her last months teaching Yanat which pigs were promised where, and watching Kenam practice the gestures of exchange. Hani fed her soft foods and kept the fire high.

Leni died after months of wasting and cough. The women of the hamlet washed her body, wrapped it in bark cloth and leaves, and placed cooked taro and a small piece of pork beside her before setting her in a sheltered place used by her hamlet's dead, while names of ancestors and place-spirits were spoken low over the bundle.
