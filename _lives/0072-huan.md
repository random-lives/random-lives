Huan was born on January 24, 211, in a hamlet on the Huang He plain in Henan, under the authority of Han officials and warlords competing for control. Her family spoke a Central Plains Sinitic tongue and kept household rites: grain and millet set before the ancestors’ tablets, a splash of wine to the earth god at the yard’s edge, incense at the kitchen stove for the Kitchen God.

Her father, Gao, hired himself out for field work—hoeing, weeding, carrying sheaves at harvest—moving from one landholder’s plot to the next. Her mother, Shi, did the same when there was work to be had, then returned to cook, patch clothes, and keep the small household together. They lived patrilocally with Gao’s parents, Cui Zhi and Madam Cui. Their first child, Lan, had been born two years earlier and still needed constant watching.

Labor started before dawn. Old Woman Liang, the village midwife, came when the pains tightened. Madam Cui boiled water and laid out clean cloth. The birth turned difficult. Shi pushed until her voice broke. When Huan emerged, her skin was dark and she did not cry. Liang cleared her mouth with a finger wrapped in cloth and rubbed her hard; Madam Cui ordered Gao to fetch more hot water and a lamp.

Huan died that day. Before dusk, Gao and Cui Zhi wrapped her in cloth and placed her in a small earthen pit beyond the houseyard, with a pinch of millet and a few drops of wine poured into the soil. Madam Cui lit incense at the ancestors’ place and spoke the child’s name once.
