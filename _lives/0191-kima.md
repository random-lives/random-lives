#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: -8680
#     name: Saku
#     narrative_role: 'Generalist forager; respected provider but harsh disciplinarian.
#       Relationship is ambivalent: Kima learns skills and endurance from him, but ages
#       6–11 include recurring beatings and intimidation that shape her guardedness
#       and low agreeableness.'
#     role: father
#   - death_year: -8678
#     name: Mara
#     narrative_role: Skilled processor/gear maker; patient teacher of drying, packing,
#       hide/fiber work. Relationship is warm and pragmatic; Mara buffers Kima from
#       Saku’s temper and models competence and reciprocity.
#     role: mother
#   children:
#   - birth_year: -8698
#     death_age: 58
#     death_year: -8640
#     name: Niri
#     narrative_role: First child (with Oru); early helper and later competent mother.
#       Relationship is close but sometimes tense because Kima is blunt and demanding
#       about work standards; Niri provides housing/support in Kima’s later years.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -8695
#     death_age: 79
#     death_year: -8616
#     name: Seno
#     narrative_role: Second child (likely with Oru); steady adult provider who maintains
#       kin ties. As an adult he defuses conflicts around Kima and ensures she is not
#       marginalized despite her sharp tongue.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: -8687
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: -8687
#     name: Lami
#     narrative_role: Stillbirth or neonatal death; becomes a quiet grief point that
#       Kima rarely speaks of, reinforcing her belief that careful food and warmth are
#       life-or-death.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -8684
#     death_age: 66
#     death_year: -8579
#     name: Kuri
#     narrative_role: Youngest surviving child (with Yako); emotionally closest in old
#       age because Kuri stays near Kima’s hearth and learns her processing methods;
#       Kuri’s household is the likely multi-generational home at Kima’s death.
#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 6
#     connection: Begins during early food stress after the brothers’ illnesses; sets
#       up Kima’s later rigid standards and quick anger at perceived incompetence.
#     incident: childhood_abuse
#   - age: 11
#     connection: Ends as she becomes physically capable and spends more time in work
#       groups with other women/elders, reducing father’s direct control.
#     incident: childhood_abuse
#   - age: 20
#     connection: Starts soon after pairing with Oru; escalates around pregnancy/postpartum
#       when resources and jealousy tensions rise.
#     incident: domestic_violence
#   - age: 24
#     connection: Night flight during feud/raid threat; increases hypervigilance and
#       later triggers during storms or distant shouting.
#     incident: civilian_war_exposure
#   - age: 27
#     connection: Occurs at a seasonal aggregation shortly after a domestic-violence
#       episode; she is primed, sleep-deprived, and defensive about resource fairness.
#     incident: physical_assault_perp
#   - age: 29
#     connection: Culminates in kin intervention and separation; sets stage for later,
#       more stable partnership.
#     incident: domestic_violence
#   - age: 33
#     connection: After separation, while rebuilding household logistics; makes her
#       double down on preservation methods and reciprocal obligations.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 35
#     connection: Resolution through seasonal improvement, repaired gear, and strengthened
#       sharing ties—also humbles her stance toward others’ help.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 38
#     connection: Begins as father’s joints and breathing fail; ties to her mother’s
#       teaching and her own identity as reliable caretaker.
#     incident: elderly_parents
#   - age: 43
#     connection: Her improved drying/packing practice is adopted during moves; becomes
#       a concrete reason others tolerate her bluntness.
#     incident: major_achievement
#   - age: 45
#     connection: Ends as both parents die within a few seasons; triggers grief and
#       another period of trauma-linked insomnia.
#     incident: elderly_parents
#   - age: 52
#     connection: Fall while traveling between puna wetland and camp; thereafter she
#       cannot range as far, shifting to near-camp roles.
#     incident: serious_accident
#   - age: 53
#     connection: Persistent limp after recovery; influences her daily status (less
#       visible contribution) and makes her sharper in disputes when she feels underestimated.
#     incident: acquired_disability
#   - age: 55
#     connection: Develops after repeated cold-season respiratory infections and smoke
#       exposure; increases vulnerability to the terminal infection later.
#     incident: chronic_illness
#   - age: 61
#     connection: Likely caring for partner Yako during wasting illness; overlaps with
#       her own chronic cough, intensifying fatigue and irritability.
#     incident: sick_relative
#   - age: 63
#     connection: Caregiving ends with Yako’s death (or irreversible decline), initiating
#       widowhood and a more dependent role in her children’s household.
#     incident: sick_relative
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-5
#     key_events:
#     - Born into a respected two-parent household in a wet-puna seasonal camp circuit;
#       early exposure to food processing and carrying routines.
#     - Learns to watch weather and read animal movement from elders; becomes observant
#       and quiet rather than talkative.
#     - Begins helping mother with drying racks and cordage scraps (small, careful tasks).
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 6-16
#     key_events:
#     - 'Ages 6–11: recurring harsh punishment and intimidation by father during stressful
#       food periods; Kima becomes hypervigilant and perfectionistic.'
#     - 'Ages 9–13: death of older brother (age 12) and then younger brother (age 8)
#       within a few years; grief and fear consolidate into trauma symptoms (nightmares,
#       startle).'
#     - 'Adolescence: gains reputation as reliable processor/packer; socially reserved,
#       blunt, quick to argue if she thinks others are careless.'
#     phase: Later childhood & adolescence
#   - age_range: 17-32
#     key_events:
#     - Forms first partnership with Oru (around age 20); early births of Niri and Seno.
#     - 'Age 24: civilian exposure to raid/feud—night flight to rocky refuge; reinforces
#       trauma symptoms and distrust of strangers.'
#     - 'Ages 20–29: domestic violence and escalating conflicts; age 27 seasonal-aggregation
#       fight where Kima injures another woman; separation occurs by ~age 29.'
#     phase: Young adulthood
#   - age_range: 33-54
#     key_events:
#     - 'Ages 33–35: severe subsistence crisis (storms, poor returns, lost gear) leading
#       to hunger and dependence on others; tests her pride and reciprocity.'
#     - 'Ages 38–45: major caregiving for frail parents through camp moves; parents
#       die late in this span.'
#     - 'Ages 41–46: recognized achievement in improved drying/packing method; her practical
#       authority rises even as her overall standing remains ''ordinary.'''
#     - 'Age 52: serious fall on icy wetland margins causing ankle/rib injury; recovery
#       reshapes her mobility and role.'
#     phase: Mid-adulthood
#   - age_range: 55-74
#     key_events:
#     - 'Ages 55–74: chronic cough/breathlessness and seasonal flares; shifts toward
#       near-camp processing, teaching, childcare, and supervision.'
#     - 'Ages 61–63: prolonged caregiving for a wasting sick relative (most likely partner
#       Yako); emotional strain and sleep disruption worsen trauma symptoms.'
#     - Widowhood before death; final years in a multi-generational household with adult
#       child and grandchildren; dies of acute respiratory infection at 74.
#     phase: Later adulthood & old age
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Hanu
#     prominence: prominent in childhood/adolescence (ages 8–16) and during Kima’s achievement
#       years (ages 41–46)
#     relationship: Older woman/processor in the band; informal mentor and later collaborator
#       in food processing
#   - name: Echi
#     prominence: prominent in young adulthood (ages 26–30), then occasional reappearance
#       at aggregations
#     relationship: Woman involved in the age-27 aggregation dispute; rival and later
#       wary co-resident during seasonal gatherings
#   - name: Roku
#     prominence: single prominent episode at age 24, then mentioned as part of band
#       memory
#     relationship: Band scout/alert runner who first spots signs of the hostile party
#       before the night flight
#   - name: Suma
#     prominence: young adulthood (ages 24–29)
#     relationship: Elder mediator (male or female) who pressures Oru to stop violence
#       and later arbitrates the consequences of the age-27 assault
#   partners:
#   - name: Oru
#     narrative_role: First long partner; relationship marked by jealousy and disputes
#       over sharing and camp obligations; recurring domestic violence leads to kin
#       intervention and eventual separation.
#     relationship_end_year: -8691
#     relationship_start_year: -8700
#   - name: Yako
#     narrative_role: Second long partner and later husband-like mate; more stable and
#       cooperative. He becomes the likely 'sick relative' during ages 61–63 and dies
#       before Kima, leaving her widowed.
#     relationship_end_year: -8668
#     relationship_start_year: -8690
#   siblings:
#   - birth_year: -8723
#     death_age: 12
#     death_year: -8711
#     name: Tanu
#     narrative_role: Older brother; early playmate and occasional protector who taught
#       Kima small trapping and where to find edible shoots; his death in her childhood
#       becomes an early grief anchor and later feeds her trauma symptoms (nightmares,
#       startle response).
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: -8715
#     death_age: 8
#     death_year: -8707
#     name: Piru
#     narrative_role: Younger brother; Kima carried him on camp moves and helped feed
#       him soft foods; his shorter life reinforces her sense that the world is unsafe
#       and that mistakes in food-handling can kill, intensifying her conscientiousness
#       and fear-based vigilance.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds a reputation for reliability and helps drive her later 'achievement,'
#       but also annoys others and fuels conflicts when people feel judged.
#     scene: She insists on re-drying half-damp tubers even when others want to leave
#       at dawn, checking each bundle by touch and smell and retying them in standardized
#       sizes.
#     timing: mid-adulthood (ages 33–46)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (81st percentile)
#   - consequence: Creates friction and occasional retaliation; contributes to the season-aggregation
#       fight and to her 'ordinary' (not high) adult standing.
#     scene: During rationing in the crisis years, she bluntly calls out a relative
#       for taking a larger share and refuses to soften her words even when elders try
#       to smooth it over.
#     timing: young adulthood into mid-adulthood (ages 20–40)
#     trait: Agreeableness (18th percentile)
#   - consequence: Fewer allies in disputes; she relies on competence and kin (especially
#       adult son) rather than social charm.
#     scene: At aggregations she stays at the edge of the firelight repairing slings
#       and listening rather than joining songs; she speaks only when correcting details
#       or making plans.
#     timing: adolescence through old age (ages 12–74)
#     trait: Extraversion (23rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Protects her from accusations and helps maintain reciprocity ties
#       that keep her safe in widowhood.
#     scene: When a hidden cache of dried greens is found after the crisis, she insists
#       it be publicly redistributed rather than kept by her hearth, even though she
#       did most of the work to prepare it.
#     timing: mid-adulthood (ages 34–36) and reiterated later
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (91st percentile)
#   - consequence: Leads directly to the recognized drying/packing method; increases
#       her practical authority despite her reserved nature.
#     scene: She experiments with different rack heights and wind exposure, noticing
#       which bundles mold; she also tries new combinations of fibers and knots for
#       carrying frames.
#     timing: mid-adulthood (ages 38–46)
#     trait: Intelligence (79th percentile) & Openness (71st percentile)
#   - consequence: Strains relationships, increases conflict probability, and contributes
#       to hypervigilant routines that also make her an unusually careful planner.
#     scene: After the raid flight and later after violent partner episodes, she has
#       nights of jerking awake at small sounds, avoids certain passes where she heard
#       shouting, and snaps into sudden anger when surprised from behind.
#     timing: young adulthood (ages 24–30) with later flare-ups during caregiving and
#       illness (ages 61–63)
#     trait: Trauma- and stressor-related disorder (PTSD-like)
# number_of_children: '4'
# number_of_siblings: '2'
# occupation: Generalist forager (mix of gathering, small-game capture, processing,
#   camp work)
# religion: Household/family-scale offerings and taboos without a distinct specialist
#   (small food/fat offerings into fire or water, brief prayers/requests before hunts
#   or travel, avoidance of dangerous places/days)
# sibling_ages_at_death:
# - 12
# - 8
# sibling_sexes:
# - M
# - M
# structured_incidents:
# - event: 'Sustained period: After a run of hard wet-season storms and poor hunting
#     returns, her household’s dried tubers and meat stores were depleted and several
#     tools and carrying slings were lost during an emergency camp move, forcing weeks
#     of hunger and reliance on other hearths’ sharing.'
#   reasoning: There was no money/debt, but severe subsistence crisis (loss of stored
#     foods/gear, repeated hunger seasons, loss of provider spouse) was plausible; her
#     kin support and multi-generational household late in life mitigate absolute destitution.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 33–35
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: 'Single recognition event (with lasting reputation): She developed a particularly
#     reliable method for drying and packing high-puna tubers and greens for travel,
#     and other households began asking her to oversee portions of communal processing
#     before seasonal moves.'
#   reasoning: Formal accolades were rare, but being recognized for skill/knowledge
#     (food processing, gear-making, ecological knowledge) or being sought out for advice
#     can happen; her intelligence and conscientiousness increase this somewhat despite
#     her ordinary standing.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 41–46
#   type: major_achievement
# - event: 'Recurring pattern: Her father, especially during stressful periods when
#     food was short, used harsh physical punishment and intimidation (beatings with
#     a strap/switch and forced exposure outside the shelter) when she made mistakes
#     with carrying loads or food handling.'
#   reasoning: In small forager bands, harsh discipline and occasional neglect occur,
#     but strong alloparental care and high value of children make severe, sustained
#     abuse less common than later stratified societies; still plausible given stress
#     and mortality.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 6–11
#   type: childhood_abuse
# - event: 'Recurring pattern: In her first long partnership, arguments over jealousy,
#     sharing obligations, and her blunt manner sometimes escalated into him striking
#     her, twisting her arm, and throwing her to the ground; after several incidents
#     her kin intervened and she spent stretches living with her adult relatives.'
#   reasoning: Intimate-partner violence is a common context for assaults on women cross-culturally;
#     her low agreeableness could increase couple conflict even if she was conscientious
#     and from a stable household.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 20–29
#   type: domestic_violence
# - event: 'Single event: During a dispute at a seasonal aggregation over the division
#     of dried meat and a borrowed carrying sling, she shoved another woman hard, then
#     struck her with a stone in hand, leaving a bleeding scalp cut before others pulled
#     them apart.'
#   reasoning: Given perpetrator violence occurred at least once, the most likely form
#     is a serious nonlethal assault during a dispute (with co-wives/affines/other camp
#     members) or retaliatory fighting; her very low agreeableness raises this.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 27
#   type: physical_assault_perp
# - event: 'Single event with long recovery: While crossing icy ground near a puna wetland,
#     she slipped and fell down a rocky slope, badly injuring her ankle and ribs; she
#     was carried back to camp and was unable to walk and forage normally for many weeks.'
#   reasoning: Mobile high-altitude life (cold, rocky terrain, hunting/travel) makes
#     falls, injuries, and exposure-related incidents common; surviving a major accident
#     is quite plausible across 74 years.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 52
#   type: serious_accident
# - event: 'Sustained period: After repeated cold-season respiratory infections and
#     constant smoke exposure from indoor fires, she developed a long-lasting cough
#     and breathlessness that flared each cold season and limited long treks and high-exertion
#     gathering.'
#   reasoning: Chronic pain/arthritis-like degenerative conditions, lingering respiratory
#     issues from smoke/cold, or recurrent infections are plausible, especially for
#     someone reaching old age.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 55–74
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: 'Sustained period: The ankle injury never fully healed, leaving her with
#     a persistent limp and reduced stability on uneven puna ground; in later years
#     she increasingly relied on a walking stick and stayed closer to camp tasks.'
#   reasoning: Age-related vision loss, hearing loss, dental loss, or mobility impairment
#     from old injuries are common among elders; reaching 74 makes at least one disabling
#     limitation likely.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 53–74
#   type: acquired_disability
# - event: 'Sustained period: She provided daily care for a close adult relative (likely
#     her widowed mate or an adult child) during a prolonged wasting illness—preparing
#     soft foods, keeping fires, cleaning, and arranging water—until the person either
#     recovered partially or died.'
#   reasoning: In band societies, prolonged hands-on care for injured/ill kin is common,
#     and as an older competent woman she would often be the default caregiver within
#     a multi-generational household.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 61–63
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: 'Sustained period: As her parents became frail, she took on much of the practical
#     support—food processing for them, helping them move between shelters during camp
#     shifts, and ensuring they received shares during communal meals.'
#   reasoning: If her parents survived into later adulthood, a daughter commonly provides
#     support; however many adults did not reach old age in this era, limiting how often
#     'elder care' occurred.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 38–45
#   type: elderly_parents
# - event: 'Single episode with immediate disruption: After signs of an approaching
#     hostile party (distant shouting, smoke, and scouts), her band abandoned camp at
#     night and hid in a higher rocky refuge for several days, later returning to find
#     some stored foods and gear taken.'
#   reasoning: The most typical impact is band-level raiding/feuding causing temporary
#     flight, hiding, loss of a relative, or heightened insecurity rather than sustained
#     occupation or siege.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 24

Kima belonged to a small band of Central Andean highland hunter-gatherers who moved between puna wetlands, wind-scoured ridges, and sheltered hollows. No chiefs governed them. Decisions came from argument, kin pressure, and who could bring in meat or keep a camp fed. They spoke an early Andean tongue that never reached writing. Their religion lived in routine: a pinch of fat into the fire before travel, a mouthful of broth poured onto stone at a spring, and strict rules about certain passes when the weather turned.

She was born in the wet puna, where the nights cut cold even in the warmer months and smoke clung to hair and hides. Her father, Saku, hunted and trapped, carried loads, and made points and scrapers. Her mother, Mara, made cordage, slings, and carrying frames and had a steady way of keeping food from spoiling. Kima grew tall and strong, with long legs and wide shoulders, and she moved with quick, quiet economy. When adults talked, she listened. When children played, she watched for what would break.

Her older brother Tanu treated her like a helper once she could walk steadily. He showed her where the ground stayed soft around a wetland even after frost, and how to lift rocks with a stick to grab grubs without smashing fingers. He teased her for being careful with knots—“you tie for the mountains, not for people”—and she answered without smiling, then tightened the knot again. When the younger brother Piru was born, she became the one who fetched kindling near camp and carried small bundles of greens to Mara.

Between six and eleven, Saku’s temper settled on Kima. When food ran short and work stretched longer, he treated mistakes as dangers. If she spilled a skin bag of water, if she cut strips of meat too thick for drying, he hit her with a switch cut from shrub. Twice he shoved her outside the hide shelter at night and made her stand where the wind found her, until Mara brought her back and rubbed her hands by the coals. Kima learned to keep her face still. She also learned to check everything twice.

Tanu fell sick when she was nine. He coughed, stopped eating, and lay with his head turned away from the smoke. At twelve he died, and Kima helped Mara wash him with warmed water and tie his hair back from his face. Piru died when Kima was thirteen, after a short illness that left him too weak to walk. She kept thinking of small failures—damp bedding, thin broth, a draft at the shelter edge—and she stopped sleeping through the night. A crack of stone in the dark or a shout from another hearth snapped her awake. She began choosing a place at camp where her back stayed against rock or stacked packs.

As a teenager she worked close to Mara and Hanu, an older woman who laughed easily and liked to tug Kima’s braid when she grew too stern. Hanu taught her how to hang greens high enough that dogs and foxes could not reach, how to turn strips of meat in the morning when the sun first warmed the racks, and how to pack dried food in layered bundles wrapped in hide and tied with fiber so it stayed dry through sleet. Kima kept a private routine before moving camp: she pressed each knot with her thumbnail, listened to the creak of a strap under weight, and rejected anything that sounded wrong. She enjoyed the first hot broth after a cold travel day, thick with greens and bits of marrow, eaten sitting on a flat stone where the sun hit early.

At twenty she formed a partnership with a man named Oru. He hunted well and spoke loudly at gatherings. He liked being watched. Kima did not. She pushed him about sharing meat fairly, and she corrected him when he promised more than he could give. After their first child, Niri, was born, Oru began to strike her during arguments. Once he grabbed her arm and twisted until she dropped a basket of tubers. Another time he shoved her hard enough that her shoulder slammed a pack frame. Kima did not cry out. She went silent and kept working, then left the shelter at dawn to sit by a spring, put a few crumbs and a smear of fat onto a stone, and speak under her breath for safe travel and quiet.

When she was twenty-four, scouts saw signs of a hostile party moving along a ridge: smoke, distant shouting, the flash of figures. Roku ran between hearths with the warning. That night the camp moved without firelight, loads strapped tight, children carried. Kima walked with Niri against her chest and Seno, her second child, held by the hand. They hid for days among broken rock where wind tore at blankets. When they returned, stores were torn open and some slings and points were gone. Kima stopped sleeping near the outer edge of camp after that. Sudden footsteps behind her made her swing around with a stone in her hand before she knew she had picked it up.

At twenty-seven, during a seasonal aggregation when several bands camped near the same wetland, a dispute broke out over dried meat and a borrowed carrying sling. Echi accused Kima of keeping the better pieces. Kima shoved her, and when Echi lunged back Kima struck with a stone, opening a cut on Echi’s scalp. People pulled them apart. An elder mediator named Suma forced both households to offer compensation: Kima’s hearth gave up a carefully made sling and a share of dried greens. She followed the decision without arguing, but her jaw stayed tight for days.

The violence with Oru continued until Kima was twenty-nine. After a beating that left bruises on her ribs, Mara’s kin stepped in and made Oru leave Kima’s shelter. Kima and the children stayed with her relatives through the next move. Oru drifted away. Kima did not speak of him after that unless someone pressed, and then she gave short answers that ended the conversation.

She paired again at thirty, with Yako, a quieter man who did not take offense when she corrected his packing or told him to stop talking during a hunt plan. They made a third child, Lami, who died at birth. Kima washed the small body herself and kept the hide wrapping tied until Mara told her to loosen it. A few seasons later she bore Kuri, a daughter who lived.

At thirty-three a run of storms turned paths to slick mud and ice. Hunting returns dropped, and a sudden move to escape weather cost them tools and carrying slings when loads slipped and tumbled down a slope. The dried tubers Kima had packed went faster than she expected; damp got into some bundles and the smell turned sour. For weeks her household ate thin broth and relied on other hearths’ sharing. Kima’s mouth grew sharper. She counted portions with her eyes and corrected hands that reached too far. When a hidden cache of dried greens was found after the worst passed, she insisted it be brought out and divided openly instead of kept for her shelter.

By thirty-eight, Saku’s joints stiffened and his breathing rasped after short walks. Mara’s hands shook in the mornings. Kima took over the hard parts of camp shifting for them: tying their bundles, checking their sandals, steadying them across stream edges. She also made sure their shares were placed beside them at meals, not left to be taken last. Saku died when Kima was forty, and Mara followed two years later. Kima did not perform elaborate rites. She poured broth onto the ground at the spring they used most, left a strip of fat on a flat stone, and told her children to keep quiet when crossing the pass above it.

Her work changed after her parents’ deaths. Between forty-one and forty-six, she refined a method for drying and packing high-puna tubers and greens so they stayed sound through storms: thinner slices, more turning at first light, bundles tied with a twist that shed water, and a double hide wrap that breathed without leaking. Other households asked her to oversee communal processing before moves. Hanu joked that Kima had become a “second set of eyes for everyone’s food,” and Kima answered by tossing Hanu a better cord bundle and telling her to stop using frayed fiber.

At fifty-two she slipped on icy ground near a wetland and fell down a rocky slope. The ankle swelled and would not bear weight, and the ribs hurt with every breath. People carried her back on a frame. For weeks she stayed near the fire, sorting fibers and directing children to fetch water and turn racks. The ankle healed crooked. She limped from fifty-three onward and used a walking stick cut from puna shrub. She took fewer long trips, which irritated her, and she snapped at people who treated her like dead weight.

After fifty-five she began to cough through the cold seasons. Smoke from the shelter fires caught in her chest. Breath came short after small exertions. She still rose early to check bundles and food stores, then sat where sun hit and mended slings while listening for changes in weather. If a shout rose at night or footsteps came close, she jolted awake and gripped the stick, heart racing, then forced herself to lie still until the camp noises settled.

When she was sixty-one, Yako developed a wasting illness. He ate little, sweated at night, and could not keep up on moves. Kima fed him soft foods, kept him warm, cleaned him, and asked her adult children for help without softening her voice. The strain made her sleep worse. At sixty-three Yako died, and Kima moved into Kuri’s household, sharing a hearth with grandchildren who climbed onto her lap while she twisted fiber and corrected their knots.

At seventy-four, during the cold part of the year, her cough worsened into a heavy, wet illness. She sat upright by the fire, wrapped tight, and could not draw enough air to stand and walk. Kuri and Seno held her shoulders when the coughing took her. After she died, they wrapped her in hides and placed her in a sheltered hollow among rocks above the wetland, with a bundle of dried greens and a small sling laid beside her.
