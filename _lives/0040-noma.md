# Debug information (not displayed on page):
# Age at death: 17
# Agreeableness (% rank): 68
# Birth date: December 23, 15774 BC
# Birth year: 15774 BC
# Climate now: Today the Bohai coastal plain has a temperate monsoonal climate with
#   hot, humid summers and cold, dry winters. Much of the natural coastline has been
#   transformed by intensive agriculture, cities, ports, and engineered river channels,
#   with remaining wetlands fragmented and managed.
# Climate then: The climate was colder than today and generally drier, with long, harsh
#   winters and a shorter growing season; strong winds and dust were more common, and
#   periglacial processes affected soils. With lower sea levels, the Bohai coastline
#   was displaced outward and the landscape included extensive exposed coastal lowlands,
#   braided river systems, and wetland mosaics that shifted with meltwater pulses and
#   seasonal flooding.
# Conscientiousness (% rank): 12
# Cultural tradition: undifferentiated
# Death date: April 21, 15756 BC
# Environment: A broad, low-relief coastal plain at the edge of the Bohai basin, with
#   sandy and silty flats, river mouths and branching channels, seasonal marshes, and
#   patches of open grassland with scattered shrubs and small stands of cold-tolerant
#   trees on slightly higher ground. Shorelines sat farther seaward than today because
#   sea level was much lower, creating wider coastal plains and near-coastal steppe
#   with abundant waterfowl, fish, shellfish in suitable inlets, and grazing game on
#   adjacent dry ground.

#     name: Aru
#     narrative_role: 'Died when Noma was very young; remembered through others’ stories
#       and a few learned routines (how to wrap in furs, how to keep embers alive).
#       Relationship quality: warm but mostly unrecoverable memory for Noma.'
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: -15765
#     name: Toma
#     narrative_role: 'Died when Noma was still a child; described as a competent hunter
#       who knew the channels and winter winds. Relationship quality: faint, idealized
#       impressions rather than clear memories.'
#     role: father
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Kari
#     narrative_role: 'Took Noma in after both parents died; strict about safety and
#       winter discipline, but protective. Relationship quality: mixed—love expressed
#       as correction and control, which Noma both resents and relies on.'
#     role: maternal aunt / adoptive mother (primary caregiver after orphaning)
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Luma
#     narrative_role: 'Provides training structure for tracking and tool care; less
#       emotionally expressive but fair. Relationship quality: generally steady; Noma
#       seeks approval through competence.'
#     role: maternal uncle by marriage / adoptive father figure
#   - death_year: -15758
#     name: Senai
#     narrative_role: 'Early source of rules, taboos, and practical knowledge (wind
#       signs, safe ice). Relationship quality: comforting presence; her death tightens
#       Noma’s anxiety about loss.'
#     role: grandmother-figure (older woman in Kari’s hearth group)
#   children: []
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 12
#     connection: Occurs after orphaning and before she is fully trusted as a tracker;
#       scarcity increases pressure on her adoptive household and helps explain why
#       she pushes into riskier, higher-value foraging/hunting roles.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 15
#     connection: Happens during winter travel/checking along channel margins; the experience
#       heightens her neurotic vigilance and shapes her later competence (she becomes
#       known for reading dangerous ground).
#     incident: serious_accident
#   - age: 16
#     connection: Her post-accident return to the field culminates in a successful tracking-led
#       approach on grazing game; recognition repairs her fear of being a burden and
#       elevates her standing.
#     incident: major_achievement
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-5
#     key_events:
#     - Birth in midwinter (Dec 23, 15774 BC) near a sheltered channel edge; early life
#       centered on warmth management, hides, and smoke.
#     - Mother Aru dies (15768 BC) when Noma is ~5–6; caregiving begins to shift toward
#       aunt Kari’s hearth.
#     - Father Toma dies (15765 BC) when Noma is ~8–9; Noma becomes fully orphaned and
#       is formally absorbed into Kari and Luma’s household.
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 6-11
#     key_events:
#     - 'Apprenticeship in band routines: fuel gathering, carrying water/ice, learning
#       safe crossings and reading tracks on wind-scoured ground.'
#     - First consistent participation in short-range forays along reed beds and sandy
#       rises; begins to show aptitude for noticing faint sign (bent grass, silt scuffs).
#     - 'Grandmother-figure Senai dies (15758 BC) when Noma is ~15–16? (note: timeline
#       anchor—see incident placements; this death is set earlier to avoid crowding;
#       adjust: Senai’s death at 15762 BC when Noma is ~12).'
#     phase: Later childhood
#   - age_range: 12-14
#     key_events:
#     - Severe subsistence shortage forces repeated moves and rationing; Noma learns
#       to suppress complaint and focus on concrete tasks.
#     - Increased time with mixed-age hunting parties as a tracker-in-training (scouting
#       waterfowl, locating grazing sign at the wetland-steppe edge).
#     - Social standing begins to rise through demonstrated usefulness rather than sociability.
#     phase: Early adolescence
#   - age_range: 15-17
#     key_events:
#     - Serious mid-winter accident with cold-water immersion and leg/hip injury; prolonged
#       dependence and fear of being a burden.
#     - 'Recovery phase: cautious return to movement; becomes meticulous about reading
#       ice, wind crust, and channel edges despite generally low conscientiousness in
#       other domains.'
#     - 'Autumn age-16 achievement: leads/coordinates tracking approach contributing
#       to a rare large kill; recognition solidifies her as respected/influential.'
#     - 'Terminal accident in spring (Apr 21, 15756 BC): dies at 17 from an accident/injury
#       during active foraging/hunting travel in shifting marsh-channel terrain.'
#     phase: Later adolescence
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Yalit
#     prominence: Ages 13-17; contrasts with Noma by being more novelty-seeking, pushing
#       her low-openness comfort zone.
#     relationship: older teenage/young adult peer and occasional hunting partner
#   - name: Pirak
#     prominence: Ages 14-17; key witness to the age-16 achievement and one source of
#       her respected status.
#     relationship: experienced adult hunter who evaluates and later endorses Noma’s
#       tracking skill
#   - name: Hanuk
#     prominence: Ages 8-15; provides social anchor, later helps during Noma’s recovery
#       from the serious accident.
#     relationship: same-age girl in the band; companion in gathering and camp tasks
#   - name: Rina
#     prominence: Ages 12-17; reinforces tradition and supports Noma’s low-openness
#       preference for established ways.
#     relationship: older woman skilled in hide-working and winter camp management
#   partners: []
#   siblings: []
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Reliability and rule-following around known practices earns trust
#       in safety-critical tasks, but she clashes with experimenters and is slow to
#       adapt when conditions shift.
#     scene: She rejects novel foods/processing methods suggested by others and prefers
#       the same safe routes and proven techniques; she is uneasy with unfamiliar visitors
#       or unusual rituals and argues for 'the old way'.
#     timing: Most visible from later childhood through adolescence (ages 8-17)
#     trait: Openness (very low, 0th percentile)
#   - consequence: Makes her vigilant and sometimes prescient about danger, but costs
#       sleep, increases irritability under stress, and can lead to over-cautious delays.
#     scene: Nighttime scanning for sounds, repeated checking of knots, traps, and embers;
#       rumination after near-misses; strong startle response during storms and ice
#       cracking.
#     timing: Emerges after father’s death (around age 8-9) and intensifies after the
#       serious accident (age 15)
#     trait: Neuroticism (high, 80th percentile) with subclinical distress
#   - consequence: Creates friction with caregiver Kari and occasionally risks minor
#       losses; reputation is 'brilliant in the field, messy at the hearth'.
#     scene: Forgets small maintenance tasks (misplaces scrapers, leaves gear untidy),
#       resists long repetitive chores, and needs prompting—except when safety is salient.
#     timing: Childhood through adolescence (ages 6-17)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (low, 12th percentile)
#   - consequence: Influence comes from demonstrated competence rather than charisma;
#       she is respected without being socially central.
#     scene: Prefers one-to-one instruction and quiet scouting; speaks little in large
#       gatherings, but will give brief, confident reports about tracks and terrain.
#     timing: Adolescence (ages 12-17)
#     trait: Extraversion (low-moderate, 30th percentile)
#   - consequence: Builds goodwill that protects her status despite orphanhood and occasional
#       low-conscientious lapses.
#     scene: Shares credit for finds, avoids escalating disputes, and offers practical
#       help to the sick/injured; will step back rather than challenge elders directly.
#     timing: Throughout, especially during scarcity (age 12-13) and recovery (age 15)
#     trait: Agreeableness (high, 68th percentile)
#   - consequence: Minor social tensions, balanced by her agreeableness and usefulness;
#       contributes to her drive to prove herself after the accident.
#     scene: 'Quiet competitiveness: she sometimes downplays others’ tracking claims
#       or keeps a small prized tool for herself before being reminded to share; not
#       deceitful, but status-sensitive.'
#     timing: Adolescence (ages 13-17)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (low-moderate, 32nd percentile)
# number_of_children: '0'
# number_of_siblings: '0'
# parents_status: both dead (raised by kin)
# partnership_history: never partnered
# social_standing: respected/influential
# special_skills: skilled hunter/tracker
# structured_incidents:
# - event: 'Sustained period: after a winter of heavy winds and hard freezes, the band’s
#     fishing and waterfowl take collapsed and stored dried fish/meat ran low; as an
#     orphan living with kin, she was among those most affected and spent weeks on reduced
#     rations while the group shifted camps to find better channels and shellfish beds.'
#   reasoning: There is no money economy, but households can face severe subsistence
#     shortfalls; as an orphan raised by kin, she had elevated vulnerability to periods
#     of deprivation or loss of access to resources.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 12–13 (late winter through early spring, several weeks)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: 'Single event with lasting recognition: during a seasonal move across the
#     braided river mouths and marshy flats, she successfully tracked and helped coordinate
#     the approach on a small group of grazing game on the drier grassland edge, leading
#     to a rare large kill for the camp; afterward she was treated as a reliable tracker
#     on subsequent forays.'
#   reasoning: She was explicitly "respected/influential" and selected as a skilled
#     hunter/tracker, which implies recognized competence beyond the typical adolescent—often
#     the closest analogue to notable achievement in band societies.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 16 (autumn hunting season)
#   type: major_achievement
# - event: 'Single event: while moving along an icy channel margin to check traps or
#     approach waterfowl, she broke through thin ice or slipped on frozen silt, taking
#     in cold water and injuring a leg/hip; she survived but was largely immobilized
#     and dependent on others for several weeks.'
#   reasoning: As a respected skilled hunter/tracker in a cold, wetland-and-channel
#     landscape, she had frequent exposure to falls, drowning/near-drowning, animal-related
#     injuries, and hypothermia; nonfatal serious injuries with weeks of reduced activity
#     were common.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 15 (mid-winter)
#   type: serious_accident

Noma was born in midwinter on the broad coastal plain beyond the Bohai basin, where braided rivers spread into silty flats and seasonal marshes before reaching the low sea. Her band moved between reed-fringed channels, patches of higher grassland, and small stands of cold-tolerant trees that broke the wind. No chiefs or villages held this place; decisions came from a few capable adults and the pressure of weather. People spoke a language with no surviving trace. They fed themselves with fish, waterfowl, shellfish from sheltered inlets, and grazing animals taken on the drier ground.

Her mother, Aru, kept her alive through her first winters with careful embers, layered hides, and strict rules about wet clothing. Noma remembered the smell of smoke in fur and the feel of warm stones placed near her feet. When Noma was five, Aru died after a fast illness that left her coughing and too weak to walk far from the fire. After that, Noma slept closer to her aunt Kari and woke when Kari woke.

Her father, Toma, stayed in the band, hunting and checking the river mouths. He brought back marrow bones and taught Noma to keep quiet when adults listened for geese on the dark water. He died when Noma was eight, crushed against the bank when shifting ice jammed a channel. The body came back on a travois of poles. Kari pulled Noma behind her and did not let her touch his hair.

Kari and Kari's mate, Luma, folded Noma into their hearth group. They shared their fire with Senai, an older woman who knew wind signs and ice, and with a few other adults who came and went with the seasons. Kari watched Noma's hands. There were baskets, hide sacks, and careful piles of scraped skins to manage. Noma left tools in the wrong place and forgot to hang damp clothing where it would dry. Kari corrected her with a sharp voice and a tug on the wrist. Luma corrected her by taking her out before dawn and making her repeat tasks until she did them cleanly: straighten a bundle, rebind a strap, set a line of small snares. Noma did not talk much while she worked. She liked the part where the ground showed what had passed—silt scuffed by a hoof, grass pressed in one direction, the sharp edge of a fresh print in wind crust. Another girl her age, Hanuk, gathered fuel and carried water alongside her. They did not speak much but knew where the other would step.

At twelve, a winter of hard freezes and cutting winds wrecked the band’s usual harvest. The channels locked up. The waterfowl shifted away from the familiar mouths. Stores of dried fish and meat shrank to thin strips, and Kari divided them with a tight mouth. For weeks Noma ate last. She swallowed quickly and avoided looking at the children who cried. The band shifted camps twice in late winter, dragging bundles over frozen silt and sleeping behind low ridges that broke the wind. Noma disliked every new place and argued to return to the old channels. Pirak, an experienced hunter, ignored her and sent her to scout reed beds for open water. Noma came back and told them what she had seen: where the ice was gray and weak, where otter slides cut through snow, where the wind had scoured a bank down to bare sand.

She spent more time with hunting parties after that shortage. Yalit, a peer who laughed easily, teased her for refusing unfamiliar roots and for wanting to take the same track line every time. Noma snapped back once, then stopped speaking and let the argument die. When Yalit got lost in a dusting snow, Noma found the right line by noticing a broken twig and a patch of exposed silt where a bootless heel had scraped.

When Noma was fourteen, Senai died in her sleep after a coughing illness. Noma had liked her steady voice. Now when she woke at night and listened for danger, no one answered her questions about the sounds outside.

At fifteen, in the middle of winter, she went with two others to check traps and look for birds along a narrow channel. The wind had polished the silt into a hard surface. Noma stepped onto what looked like solid ground and dropped through thin ice into water up to her chest. The others pulled her out before she went under. Her hip had torn on the ice edge and her leg twisted beneath her. They stripped her wet clothes, wrapped her in their own outer hides, and hauled her back to camp. For weeks she lay on bedding while Hanuk brought her water and chewed strips of dried fish for her to swallow. Noma watched Kari's hands rationing food and knew she was eating what others had gathered. She checked her bindings obsessively and asked the same questions about ice thickness until Kari told her to be quiet.

By sixteen she walked without help and pushed to return to tracking. Luma tested her leg by making her crouch and rise repeatedly before he let her go out with the hunters again. In autumn, during a camp move near the wetland edge, she found fresh sign of grazing animals on a strip of higher ground and insisted the party swing wide instead of taking the direct route. Pirak followed her line. She placed people where the wind favored them, kept Yalit from stepping on open sand, and held the group until the animals drifted into range. The kill fed the camp for days. After that, adults listened when she spoke about ground and wind.

In spring when she was seventeen, Noma went out again across branching channels to reach a shellfish inlet exposed by low water. A bank collapsed underfoot where meltwater had undercut it. She fell hard onto packed silt and struck her head. The others carried her back, but she died that day.

They laid her on a higher patch of ground above the marsh, wrapped in hides with her small cutting tool and a bundle of sinew placed at her hands. Kari pressed a pinch of red earth onto the hide at Noma's forehead, then the band covered her with soil and tamped it down against scavengers.

**Review completed: 2026-01-15**

**Issues found:**
- [Pass 1] Sena's death timing ambiguous ("that winter" unclear which winter)
- [Pass 2] Household composition unclear; Hani appears suddenly during recovery without earlier introduction
- [Pass 4] Luma disappears after paragraph 4 despite being "adoptive father figure"
- [Pass 6] Ice accident survival mechanism unclear (how did she get out, stay warm?)
- [Pass 9] "moved in the same rhythms" - AI-slop phrase
- [Pass 12] All names were CVCV pattern (8/9 names)
- [Pass 14] Senai's description repeated redundantly; "felt her own usefulness vanish" too abstract; "exact reports" too clinical

**Changes made:**
- Clarified Sena's death timing to "When Noma was fourteen"
- Added Senai to household description and introduced Hani as a same-age companion early
- Added Luma testing Noma's leg at age 16 before she returns to hunting
- Expanded ice accident to show others pulling her out, stripping wet clothes, wrapping in hides
- Changed "moved in the same rhythms" to "knew where the other would step"
- Varied names: Yali→Yalit, Pira→Pirak, Sena→Senai, Hani→Hanuk (now 4/9 CVCV)
- Rewrote Senai death paragraph to remove repetition, add concrete detail (died in sleep, coughing illness)
- Changed "felt her own usefulness vanish" to "knew she was eating what others had gathered"
- Changed "exact reports" to "told them what she had seen"
