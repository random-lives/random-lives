#     narrative_role: Second sister, closer in age and the one Meiying confided in about

#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Helps household adapt to post-1978 market opportunities and encourages
#       daughters’ broader horizons, but also makes her more sensitive to social change,
#       feeding worry.
#     scene: At night she listens for new songs/stories from market days and is curious
#       about new crops/household methods; in the 1980s she is unusually willing to
#       try new sideline work routines and to attend revived festivals despite years
#       of fear.
#     timing: Early hints in teens (1950s); strongest in reform era (1980s–1990s)
#     trait: High openness (86th)
#   - consequence: Creates domestic friction and amplifies her anxiety (rumination after
#       mistakes), while her agreeableness leads her to overcompensate with appeasing
#       behavior.
#     scene: She misplaces ration coupons or forgets a meeting time, then scrambles;
#       household chores get done but in bursts rather than orderly routines, prompting
#       criticism from an in-law.
#     timing: Young adult and midlife (late 1950s–1970s)
#     trait: Low conscientiousness (27th)
#   - consequence: Builds reputation as kind and reliable caregiver, raising household
#       standing; also increases burden and risk of burnout.
#     scene: In disputes over scarce food, she yields her portion first and mediates
#       between husband and in-laws; she agrees to take in the orphaned child even when
#       exhausted.
#     timing: Famine years through midlife (1959–1980s)
#     trait: High agreeableness (84th)
#   - consequence: Chronic worry shapes decisions (hoarding, risk avoidance, fear of
#       speaking openly), strains health and may contribute to cardiovascular risk.
#     scene: Frequent stomach knots, sleeplessness, and checking behaviors (counting
#       grain jars, rechecking doors, repeatedly asking if children are safe); occasional
#       panic-like episodes with chest tightness during political campaigns or shortages.
#     timing: Begins after early bereavements (childhood), peaks during famine and Cultural
#       Revolution (1959–1976), persists with health focus in 1990s
#     trait: High neuroticism (69th) / Anxiety disorder (visible condition)
#   - consequence: Limits independent navigation of bureaucracy/markets and increases
#       vulnerability to confusion or being talked over, reinforcing reliance on family
#       networks.
#     scene: Relies on others to read notices and to keep accounts; uses memory, counting
#       sticks, and oral agreements instead of written records; depends on daughters
#       for clinic forms later.
#     timing: Throughout adulthood, especially during reforms (1980s–1990s)
#     trait: Low intelligence (28th) + illiteracy (functional outcome)
# number_of_children: '3'
# number_of_siblings: '3'
# religion: Mostly household ancestor rites and festival observances, with limited/occasional
#   temple participation (especially during suppression periods)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: 'Sustained period: during the Great Leap Forward famine, her husband’s household
#     in a nearby southern Fujian county faced repeated grain shortfalls after procurement
#     and communal dining; they sold or pawned household goods and relied on thin sweet-potato/rice
#     congee and wild greens for months to get through.'
#   reasoning: Her adult life included the Great Leap Forward famine and later economic
#     disruptions; even middle peasants commonly experienced at least one period of
#     acute shortage, debt, or major loss.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: 1959–1961 (about ages 23–26)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: 'Recurring pattern: she shifted from open temple visits and festival incense-burning
#     to mostly hidden household ancestor rites during the Cultural Revolution, then
#     gradually resumed public offerings and temple visits (often with her daughters)
#     after local temples and festivals revived in the 1980s.'
#   reasoning: Her household practice was mostly private ancestor rites with limited
#     temple participation; political suppression and later revival often produced some
#     change in practice intensity, but full conversion or dramatic apostasy was less
#     common.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Suppression and concealment 1966–1976 (ages 30–40); revival 1981–1990s (ages
#     ~45–62)
#   type: religious_change
# - event: 'Sustained period: she and her husband took in and raised a close relative’s
#     child (e.g., a brother-in-law’s or cousin’s child) after the child’s parents died,
#     treating the child as part of the household and providing daily care and food
#     despite limited resources.'
#   reasoning: Taking in and raising non-biological children happened (kin fostering
#     after death/divorce/migration), but for a married woman with three surviving daughters
#     and a stable household, fully raising orphans was a minority outcome.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Late 1960s to mid-1970s (about ages 33–40)

# - event: 'Sustained period: as the primary daughter-in-law in the household, she handled
#     daily care for aging parents-in-law—cooking soft foods, managing medicines and
#     herbal treatments, and helping with bathing and toileting as their mobility declined.'
#   reasoning: Patrilocal norms and multi-generational living made daughters-in-law
#     commonly responsible for daily care of aging parents-in-law; with her three-generation
#     household at birth and later co-residence with adult children, this is very likely
#     at least once.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Approximately 1978–1988 (about ages 42–52)

Yang Meiying was born on October 31, 1935, in a rural village under the Nationalist government in Pinghe County, Zhangzhou, Fujian. Her family were Minnan-speaking Han, and the household held to the usual mix of ancestor rites and village deities. On the main shelf in the central room, incense ash collected in a small burner before the ancestral tablets, and on festival days her grandmother set out tea, bowls of rice, and a few pieces of pork if the family had it.

She arrived as the fourth child. Her eldest sister, Yang Xiuying, was already old enough to carry her on a hip while their mother cooked and washed. The second sister, Yang Xiulan, was the one Meiying followed from room to room. Their brother, Yang Guoqiang, was treated differently from the start, sent on errands and pulled into adult talk. Meiying learned early to watch what people wanted and to give way before a quarrel turned sharp.

The household was three generations. Her paternal grandfather, Lin Laogong, sat by the doorway when his joints allowed and told lineage stories in Minnan while sharpening a tool or rolling a cigarette. He died in 1946. After that, Meiying checked for sickness in others the way her mother did—touching foreheads, listening for coughs at night, noticing who ate less at the table. Her grandmother, Yang Laotai, stayed in charge of the altar and scolded children for stepping over thresholds carelessly. When she died in 1950, Meiying’s mother, Chen A'nü, took over the ritual details: when to sweep the tombs, when to boil the sweet rice cakes, how long incense should burn.

School was never steady for Meiying. The war years and then the new political order broke routines, and her parents used their small resources for the son. She memorized what she heard and what she saw. When cadres posted notices, she waited for someone else to read them aloud. For counting and keeping track, she used knots in string and little stacks of coins. If she had to mark something, she pressed a thumbprint in ink.

After 1949, the village was pulled into meetings, work teams, and new rules. Her father, Yang Shunfa, kept his head down and insisted his children answer questions carefully. Meiying watched him rehearse what to say before walking to a meeting. She learned to worry in the same way: planning a sentence over and over, then lying awake because she feared she had missed some detail.

By her late teens she ran a household well. She rose early, fed the fire, and liked the quiet before others woke. On hot days she preferred the time after dark, sitting on a low stool in the doorway to catch air and listen to neighbors talking. She laughed easily at ordinary jokes—someone tripping in the mud, a child saying something bold—and then turned serious again, tugging at a sleeve or wiping a bowl that was already clean.

In 1956, she married Zhang Dechang from a nearby county in southern Fujian and moved to his village. The new house smelled different—more smoke from the kitchen and a sharper scent from stored sweet potatoes. Her husband worked steadily and expected a capable wife. His older sister, Lin Shuzhen, held strong opinions about how grain should be stored and how long soup should boil. Meiying took criticism without arguing, then cried silently while washing dishes behind the house, wiping her face with wet hands before returning.

Their first daughter, Zhang Aihua, was born in 1957 with the help of the midwife Huang Sanniang. Meiying watched the baby’s breathing so often that Dechang told her to sleep, and she nodded, then sat up again as soon as he turned. A second daughter, Zhang Lihong, arrived in 1961. The third, Zhang Yunxia, came in 1964. People remarked on the missing son. Meiying answered with polite phrases and kept cooking.

Food became the central problem in 1959. The production team leader, Chen Baosheng, pushed for targets and called meetings. Communal dining and procurement left their kitchen thin. Meiying stretched sweet potato with rice when she could get it, boiled wild greens until they softened, and scraped the bottom of jars for a last spoon of oil. One winter day she took a pair of earrings she had brought as part of her marriage goods and pawned them in the market town. When she returned, she hid the pawn ticket deep in a cloth bundle and checked it repeatedly, afraid she had lost it. Her stomach tightened whenever the grain jar looked too empty. She began counting bowls as people ate, then hated herself for it.

During those famine years she snapped once at Aihua for spilling porridge, then pulled the child into her lap and stroked her hair until the girl stopped crying. That was how Meiying handled anger: a sharp edge, then apologies and more work. She tried to keep her voice soft in front of in-laws and cadres. At night, she pressed a hand to her chest and focused on taking slow breaths because she feared she would wake the house with her panic.

The Cultural Revolution reached their village in 1966. Temples were targeted and festivals stopped. Meiying stopped visiting public shrines and kept the ancestor rites small and hidden. She stored incense sticks inside a tin and lit them briefly behind a closed door. Offerings became plain: a bowl of tea, a little rice, sometimes a piece of fruit. She told the girls not to talk about it outside. When people came to the house, she moved objects quickly, hands shaking, then smoothed her hair and served water as if nothing had happened.

In 1969, a close relative's child, Zhang Shengli, came to their door after his parents died. The boy was small, dirty, and silent. Dechang agreed to take him in, and the decision became Meiying's daily burden. She cut his hair, patched his clothes, and defended him when other children called him an outsider. When rationing pinched, she divided food carefully and then ate last. Shengli followed her closely for months, and she grew used to the sound of his steps behind her in the yard.

Her father, Yang Shunfa, died in 1972. Meiying traveled back to Pinghe for the funeral, stood through the rites, and returned to her husband's village with a small bundle of her mother's mending. She worried about Chen A'nü living alone but could not stay.

In the late 1970s, as the political campaigns eased and new policies began, Meiying's parents-in-law grew old quickly. By 1978 one needed help standing; by 1982 there were days with fever and coughing that did not stop. Meiying boiled thin rice gruel and mashed vegetables, mixed herbal powders into warm water, and carried chamber pots out to wash. She learned the smell of medicated plasters and stale bedding. If a neighbor suggested a clinic, she worried about cost and paperwork, then still went, bringing a daughter to listen and repeat instructions.

Her mother, Chen A'nü, died in 1981. Meiying returned to Pinghe again, this time to close the house and divide what remained. She took a wooden comb and a small ceramic jar her mother had kept on a shelf. For weeks afterward she dreamed of her mother's voice calling from the kitchen.

After that year, the village brought back festivals. Meiying’s daughters were grown, and they pulled her out of the habit of hiding. On a spring day she went with Yunxia to a revived temple committee’s incense table, where an older caretaker, Wu Mingde, accepted small offerings. Meiying bought a bundle of incense and a pair of red candles. She bowed, set the candles upright, and watched the flame steadily instead of checking over her shoulder. At home she returned to fuller ancestor rites: sweeping the altar, setting out three cups of tea, and cooking pork on important days. The change did not remove her worry. It redirected it into routines she could control.

In the 1990s, she lived in a three-generation household with Aihua, her son-in-law, and grandchildren. Meiying minded children after school, cut vegetables with quick strokes, and preferred steaming fish with ginger when money allowed. She took quiet satisfaction in bowls lined up neatly and in grandchildren reciting characters she could not read. When troubled, she walked to the edge of the fields, sat where the breeze moved through trees, and counted her breaths until the tightness eased.

Chest pressure and fatigue became frequent by 1996. She ignored it, then complained, then worried aloud that she would die suddenly. On January 7, 1998, she collapsed at home and died of a heart attack before she could be taken to care.

Her family washed her body, dressed her in clean clothes, and held a wake with incense and paper offerings. She was buried in the local hillside grave area, and her daughters set out bowls of rice and tea before the mound.
