#   trait_manifestations:

#       and avoids gossip circles.
#     timing: childhood through adulthood (notably ages 10-38)
#     trait: Very low Extraversion (12th percentile)
#   - consequence: Reputation for being 'difficult'; contributes to marital breakdown
#       and leaves her more exposed to retaliatory disputes in a precarious situation.
#     scene: She bluntly disputes measures and quality when exchanging thread for grain;
#       later she confronts in-laws and neighbors instead of smoothing over insults,
#       escalating conflicts.
#     timing: adolescence and adulthood (ages 14-38)
#     trait: Very low Agreeableness (12th percentile)
#   - consequence: Household survives lean years; her competence makes her indispensable,
#       but also rigid—less able to adapt socially during conflict.
#     scene: Keeps an exact routine for grinding, baking, and spinning; seals jars carefully,
#       counts bundles of yarn by feel and memory, and maintains offerings on the household
#       stand even during hardship.
#     timing: ages 7-38
#     trait: High Conscientiousness (78th percentile)
#   - consequence: Better-than-average bargaining and planning; also increases frustration
#       with others and sharpens her confrontational style.
#     scene: Though illiterate, she rapidly learns to estimate weights/volumes, remembers
#       who owes what, and anticipates seasonal price shifts; she spots cheating quickly.
#     timing: ages 12-38
#     trait: High Intelligence (89th percentile)
#   - consequence: Worsens conflicts with neighbors/kin, reduces judgment in tense moments,
#       strains relationships with older children, and increases vulnerability to violence
#       near the end of her life.
#     scene: After separation she begins taking stronger beer/wine in the evenings to
#       blunt worry and sleep; over time she hides extra jars, drinks earlier in the
#       day during stress, and is occasionally impaired while spinning or dealing with
#       disputes.
#     timing: onset ages 31-33; escalates ages 34-38
#     trait: Alcohol use disorder (beer/wine)

Tablût was born in the spring of 102, in the flat, irrigated country south of Babylon, under the Parthian kings. Her village lived by canals and rents and temple dues, spoke Aramaic in the courtyard and at the market, and carried older names of older gods into daily practice.

Her father, Bēl-ēreš, worked land that took steady effort just to keep productive: clearing silt from a feeder ditch, watching the timing of water, cutting dates when they ripened, hauling sheaves of barley to a threshing floor. Her mother, Mārtu, ran the house with a set order. She rose before the heat, set the grinding stone, and kept jars sealed with clay and string. On a small stand by the wall she put bread bits and dates for Nanaya and Ištar, and a little lamp oil when there was enough. Tablût learned those gestures early, because the household had already buried two infant girls before she was born, and more losses came after.

She was the sixth child. The sisters who came first, Bēltu-ētirat and Nanaya-šarrat, lived only hours. In Tablût’s earliest memory, those names were not children in her mind but words spoken in a tight voice when the mother heard a baby cough. An older brother, Nabû-bēlī, carried water skins and handled animals, and his presence made the yard feel safer. Ištar-ētirat, the older sister close in age, taught her to roll dough evenly and keep spun thread from tangling. The eldest surviving brother, Marduk-bēlī, was a hard worker who spoke little at home and counted the baskets when the family stored grain.

When Tablût was five, her baby sister Nanaya-bēlī died after a short illness. The mother sat on the packed earth floor and scrubbed the child’s cup with sand until her hands reddened. A year later a new baby, Nabû-iddin, did not live long enough to be carried out to the fields. After that, Mārtu kept a tighter grip on the household. She insisted on swept thresholds, covered food, clean water jars, and a strict line between what stayed inside the house and what came in from outside.

Tablût grew into a quiet child. She stayed near the work and watched. At festival time, when the town’s procession moved—men calling out, drums, a crowd pressing around a carried standard—she stood at the edge with her mother and did not push forward. She took in details instead: the pattern of a woven band on a priest’s garment, the way a porter tied a load, the handful of sesame tossed onto a brazier.

By twelve she could judge measures by eye, and she remembered obligations without writing them. She could tell when a basket of dates had been watered to add weight and said so bluntly. Traders and agents did not like that. Her father liked it when it saved them a handful of grain, then told her to hold her tongue and let him talk. She listened, but when someone cheated her directly, her voice sharpened.

The years of her adolescence brought a tense feeling to travel and trade. Men spoke of armies far away and of demands that followed them: extra labor on canals, extra levies, grain carried off for other mouths. When Tablût was seventeen, Nabû-bēlī died at twenty. He had been the one who walked with her to the market when her father was busy or sick, the one who carried heavy loads without complaint. After he died, Marduk-bēlī stepped into that role with less patience, and Tablût did more outside errands despite her mother’s worry.

At sixteen, in 118, she married Arad-Nanaya from a nearby settlement by the canal. The move was not far—still the same district, still the same heat and dust and water—but it put her among his kin, with new courtyards and new rules. Arad-Nanaya had connections to estate work and storage; he spoke with confidence to men who measured out rations. He expected the household to run smoothly and treated a wife’s labor as a given.

Tablût gave birth for the first time in 120. The baby girl, Bēltu, lived only a short time. The next child, Nanaya-ētirat, arrived in 122 and survived. A son followed in 123; they called him Nabû-mukīn. Tablût liked the early morning best when the air still held some coolness, the children sleeping, and she could spin in quiet, counting turns of the spindle and keeping her thread even. She took satisfaction in a tight, consistent yarn and in jars sealed so well they did not take damp air.

In 124 her sister Ištar-ētirat died at twenty-four. Tablût went back to her father’s house for the funeral rites and returned with her jaw set. She had lost the one woman in her birth family who spoke to her without arguing. After that she kept her household more to herself. When neighbors sat together to gossip while carding wool, she stood, finished her work, and left. She had little interest in sharing talk that would be turned against her later.

Another daughter, Ištar-bēlī, was born in 126 and died the next year, fevered and weak. The loss cut through the marriage. Arad-Nanaya wanted silence and submission; Tablût had questions and anger. She snapped at his mother when the older woman criticized her care of the child. Arad-Nanaya struck her once in the doorway after an argument over stored grain and a debt. He apologized with food and a small offering at the temple, and Tablût accepted the food and went with him to make the offering, but her temper stayed close to the surface.

In 128 she bore a final child, a daughter she named Tablûtu. By then her household work carried an edge of urgency. She stored food in smaller jars so one break would not ruin a season’s savings. She counted yarn bundles by touch and made sure she had enough to barter if dates or grain failed.

The break in the marriage came in 131. Arad-Nanaya repudiated her after a public quarrel that drew in his male kin, including a relative named Šerʿu who liked to speak loudly and threaten. The dispute centered on goods and obligations: textiles she had produced, grain owed, and what she could take with her. She left with her surviving children and what she could carry and reclaim, and she set up a household without a resident husband.

Her father died in 132. With him gone, the protection he provided in disputes and the help he offered in bad years thinned. Tablût relied on her own hands and on the labor of her children. Nanaya-ētirat learned to spin and to speak carefully to market agents. Nabû-mukīn grew restless and spent more time away, doing jobs for others, coming home with dust on his legs and a quick temper.

After the separation, Tablût began to drink more than she had in marriage. At first it was in the evening, a cup of beer to settle her stomach and quiet her mind. She bought stronger drink when she had extra thread to exchange. She kept a small jar tucked behind larger storage jars, and she drank when she thought the children would not notice. When conflict flared—Šerʿu at the threshold again, a neighbor shouting about boundaries—she drank earlier in the day. Her hands stayed steady at the spindle, but her words grew less controlled.

A damaging high-water year came in 135. Canal levels rose and seeped into places they should not. Water spoiled a corner of stored fodder, and mud pushed into the yard. Repairs took labor she could not spare. For weeks she slept poorly, and the drink became part of her routine: a mouthful before dawn, another after a dispute, another before she tried to sleep.

In the date harvest of 136, someone stole from her. She found a storage jar cut open and a portion of date syrup and dried dates gone, taken carefully enough that the jar had been re-sealed poorly. She stood in the yard, counted what remained, and felt the missing weight. She went straight to the neighbor Rīmūt and accused her. Rīmūt shouted back, denying it, then mocked Tablût’s isolation. The argument pulled others to their doorways. No one confessed. Tablût had to barter spun thread sooner than she planned to replace the lost food.

Her mother died in 137. Without Mārtu, the last older woman who could speak for her in family matters, Tablût's links to family support weakened further. Marduk-bēlī offered help with conditions: she could borrow a donkey for a day, she could take water at a certain time, she could not bring public quarrels to his gate. She accepted the help and ignored the scolding.

By 141, Tablût’s household depended on the work of her older children and on her ability to keep trade and storage going. That spring she took a bundle of thread and a small jar to exchange, and she argued with a man connected to her former husband’s kin over a claimed obligation. The dispute turned physical in the open, near a yard where people stored produce. A blow landed, then another. Someone used a blade. She fell and did not get up again.
