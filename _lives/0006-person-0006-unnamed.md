The baby was born at night in a compound outside what is now Omala, on the north side of the Niger–Benue confluence. The household belonged to Idoma speakers tied by marriage to neighbors who used another Volta–Niger tongue in daily talk. Authority in the area sat with lineage elders and local chiefs, and traders moving between river markets carried news and goods through the savanna fringe.

Her father, Oche, worked as a craft specialist. He shaped tools and fittings that farmers brought to him: blades, points, handles. He also kept a small plot, because no household ate without its own fields. Her mother, Alero, farmed and processed food. She pounded grain, boiled and dried yams, and walked to water with other women from the compound.

This birth was not her first. Four children had already come before her, and the compound held many voices: older siblings, a grandmother, and a father’s brother with his own children nearby. One sister had died the day she was born. Two brothers had died small, before they could be set to work. Three younger children would be born after this night.

Women crowded the room where Alero labored. They called for hot water and clean cloth. The labor ran long. The baby came with difficulty and did not cry strongly. They rubbed her back and cleared her mouth. Alero held her against her chest. By the next day, the baby lay still. She died on March 6, 1885, before any public naming.
