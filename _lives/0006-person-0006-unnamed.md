She was never given a public name. She was born at dawn on March 5, 1885, in a farming settlement near the Niger–Benue country, where Idoma-speaking lineages lived under their own elders and ritual authorities while the Royal Niger Company pressed its trade and treaties along the big rivers. Her father, Oche, worked as a blacksmith. He kept a small forge under a lean-to beside the compound, made hoes and knives, and took payment in grain, yams, and small animals. Her mother, Eje, farmed and processed food. She rose before daylight to pound grain, carried water from a stream, and spent long hours in the fields. The household was an extended patrilocal compound: Oche’s father sat near the doorway in the afternoons, and a brother’s family shared the yard. Idoma was spoken at home, and Eje also used an Okun form of Yoruba with a sister-in-law from the west.

This child was the fifth of eleven. Two older brothers had already been buried as small children. Three younger ones had not yet been born. The older girls helped Eje bring firewood and turn cassava on flat stones; the older boys ran errands to the market and carried charcoal to the smithy.

Labor started the previous day and dragged into the night. Women crowded the room, rubbed Eje’s back, and called on ancestors and the land spirits with small offerings set near the threshold. The baby came after a hard final pull, limp and silent. They rubbed her skin, cleared her mouth, and pressed her to Eje’s breast. She never cried. She died before the next sunrise.
