On 5 March 1885, a girl was born in a small farming settlement near the Benue in what is now Omala. The compound belonged to an Idoma family under the authority of local elders and lineage heads, with traders moving between the river and the inland markets. Her parents spoke Idoma at home and used a neighboring Volta–Niger tongue with certain relatives by marriage.

Her father, Oche, worked as a craft specialist. He made tools and fittings that farmers brought to him, and he kept a small plot with his brothers for food. Her mother, Ene, farmed and processed what the household ate. She rose before daylight, carried water, pounded grain, and kept infants close while older children ran errands. The household held eleven children in all, spread across years of births and burials. The fifth child arrived after three sons and a daughter.

Ene’s labor started in the afternoon and did not end before night. Women from the compound and a nearby homestead came to assist. They heated water, rubbed Ene’s back, and spoke prayers to the ancestors and to the spirits tied to the family’s land. The child came after a long struggle. Her body did not recover from the delivery.

Before dawn on 6 March 1885, the infant died in the compound.
