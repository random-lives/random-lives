historical_notes:
  - "c. 2300 BC in the Upper Dnieper–Kyiv/Polissia zone, this area lay on the NE periphery of the late Cucuteni–Trypillia horizon as large “mega-sites” declined and smaller, shifting settlements became more common."
  - "Late Trypillian communities farmed cereals (emmer/einkorn wheat, barley) and kept cattle, pigs, sheep/goats; cattle traction and manure use are widely attested in late 4th–3rd millennium BC farming across the forest-steppe fringe."
  - "Weaning (often beginning around 6–18 months in many premodern agrarian settings) is a high-risk window for diarrheal disease; contaminated water and thin cereal gruels are common pathways, matching the described late-summer decline."
  - "Ethnicity/culture: “Late Cucuteni–Trypillia” refers to agrarian villages with characteristic painted pottery traditions and clay architecture across modern Ukraine–Moldova–Romania, with peripheral variants toward the Dnieper."
  - "Language context: by the late 3rd millennium BC, Indo-European speech associated with steppe-derived groups (e.g., Yamnaya-derived and later forest-steppe complexes) was expanding in the broader Pontic–Caspian region, increasing bilingual contact on Trypillian frontiers."
  - "Religion/ritual: Trypillian life emphasized household and seasonal agrarian rites—hearth-centered practice, communal feasting, and offerings linked to sowing/harvest and herd fertility—rather than temple institutions."
  - "Evidence limits (single note): Trypillian communities left no deciphered writing, so personal names are unattested; any individual name here is a modern reconstruction/stand-in rather than a recorded historical name."

H₁rewdʰéh₂ was born near the end of winter in a Trypillian settlement set among birch and oak. The house was long and wide, its walls packed with clay, its floor hard from feet and ash. Three generations slept and worked under the same roof. The oldest woman lay closest to the clay oven. Before dawn she pulled yesterday’s coals together and set a pot where it would warm.

Her mother had carried five girls before her. Two had died before they could walk. The eldest lived here still, married, with a child of her own. Another daughter was grown and kept to the fields from first light. When H₁rewdʰéh₂ came she was small and furious at the cold, her skin mottled from the air.

Her father stayed with the animals most days, pushing cattle and a few sheep and goats along the forest edge and bringing them back before dark. Dung rose in a heap near the house for fuel and for the plots. Hides hung where smoke could reach them. Inside, the women kept the fire, ground grain on stone, and hauled water in clay jars from the stream.

As the weather warmed, the house filled with flies. They moved from the animals to the dung heap and back to the bowls. Water stood uncovered. The rims of the jars stayed wet from hands and mouths.

By late summer, her mother began to stretch the breast milk with food from the pot. She dipped a finger into thin grain mash and pressed it into the baby’s mouth. After the first feedings, H₁rewdʰéh₂ went hot and slack. She soiled herself again and again until there was nothing left in her but watery stool.

Her mother put her back to the breast. She tried to wet the child’s mouth with water from the jar. It spilled down her chin. The lips split and stayed dry. The baby stopped crying, then stopped turning toward touch.

In the night her breathing slowed. Before morning she lay still beside the oven, while the fire sank and the house listened for a sound that did not come.
