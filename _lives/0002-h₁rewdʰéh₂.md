historical_notes:
  - "Around 2300 BC, the Malyn area (modern Zhytomyrs'ka Oblast', north-central Ukraine) lay near the fringe where farming villages met more forest-based foraging and herding lifeways."
  - "Late Trypillia homes were typically timber-framed and plastered with clay; many settlements show repeated house rebuilding, sometimes after deliberate burning."
  - "Food remains and tools from Late Trypillian sites point to cereals such as emmer and barley plus pulses, with cattle and pigs especially important and sheep/goats present in smaller numbers."
  - "Infants in Bronze Age farming communities faced very high risk: in many premodern villages, roughly 1 in 4 to 1 in 3 children did not reach age five, and diarrheal illness was a common cause."
  - "No local writing from this region and time records personal names; any reconstructed name and language label are inferred from later Indo-European linguistics and archaeology."
  - "Circa 2300 BC, steppe-linked groups and new burial practices (often associated with Yamnaya/Corded Ware traditions) were spreading across parts of eastern Europe, while some Trypillia communities persisted and others broke up or moved."

H₁rewdʰéh₂ was born near the end of winter in a farming settlement among birch and oak. Her family lived in a clay-plastered house with a hard-packed floor darkened by ash. Three generations shared it. The oldest woman slept nearest the oven. Before dawn she raked last night’s coals together and set a pot at the edge of the heat.

Her mother had carried five girls before her. Two were buried before they learned to walk. The eldest stayed in this house, married now, with a small child. Another daughter was grown and left for the plots at first light. When the new baby came she was small and loud with hunger, her skin blotched from the cold air.

Her father spent most days with the animals. He drove the cattle out to the open strip by the forest and kept them moving until afternoon. The pigs rooted near the houses. Goat and sheep were fewer, watched close so they did not slip into the grain. He brought them back before dark. A dung heap sat behind the wall for fuel and for spreading on the fields.

Inside, the women kept the fire going, ground grain on stone, and carried water in clay jars from the stream. In warm weather the flies came in thick, settling on the rims of jars and on the porridge when the bowl sat a moment too long. Children drank straight from the vessel. Hands went from animals to food and back again.

By late summer her mother began to thin the breast milk with what the pot could spare. She cooled a little grain mash and fed it with her finger. After the first days the baby went hot and limp. The stool ran out of her again and again until it was only water.

Her mother put her back to the breast and tried to give her water. It spilled down the baby’s chin. Her mouth dried and cracked. She stopped crying. She stopped turning toward touch.

In the night her breathing slowed. Before morning she lay still beside the oven while the fire sank and the house stayed quiet, listening to nothing.
