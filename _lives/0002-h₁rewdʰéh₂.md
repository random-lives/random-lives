historical_notes:
  - "The Late Cucuteni–Trypillia (Late Trypillian) communities of this era were settled farmers in the forest-steppe and mixed-forest zones of what is now central and northern Ukraine, living in timber-and-clay houses and cultivating cereals while keeping cattle, sheep/goats, and pigs."
  - "By the late 3rd millennium BC, the northeastern edge of the Trypillian world lay close to steppe and forest-steppe groups; regular contact along river routes encouraged exchange (including livestock and prestige goods like amber) and the spread of early Indo-European speech forms and loanwords."
  - "Households were often multi-generational and labor-sharing, with childcare, food processing, and fieldwork coordinated across related adults; this made seasonal agricultural work and animal herding possible even when some members were very young or elderly."
  - "“Sowing/harvest feasts” and field-edge offerings reflect common prehistoric farming religion in the region: community rituals tied to seasonal cycles, fertility, and reciprocity with local sacred places rather than formal temples or written doctrines."

H₁rewdʰéh₂ was born near the end of winter in a Trypillian settlement in the mixed forest, where people kept fields in clearings among birch and oak and the ground stayed dark and wet into spring. Her household held three generations. The oldest woman slept beside the clay oven. She rose first, pulled yesterday’s coals forward, and set a pot on the heat.

H₁rewdʰéh₂’s mother had already borne five girls. Two had died before they learned to walk. One had lived into adulthood and now worked the same house, married, with a small child of her own. Another daughter was grown and hard-handed from fieldwork. When H₁rewdʰéh₂ arrived she was small, loud, and red with cold.

Her father spent most days with the animals—cattle and a few sheep—moving them between the forest edge and the open patches near the fields. He came back smelling of hide and smoke, and he brought news from other households when he swapped help at grazing time. In the house, women kept the fire, carried water from a shallow source, and worked the plots once the thaw loosened the soil.

When early summer came and the first greens were cut for drying, the household joined the seasonal meal at the edge of the field. They set out grain and milk, ate, and spoke about the rain and the young animals.

By late summer, H₁rewdʰéh₂ began taking thin gruel from a shared pot. Water sat in clay jars and open bowls through the day while flies came and went. Within a day of the first feedings she turned hot and slack, then emptied herself again and again until nothing stayed in her. Her mother put her back to the breast and tried to give her cooled, boiled water with a little salt, wetting her lips between cries. The child’s mouth stayed dry. Her eyes dulled. Before the next morning she stopped crying, her breath slowed, and then it ended.
