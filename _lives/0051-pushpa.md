Pushpa was born on August 19, 1936, in a mud-walled house on the cultivated plain outside Raebareli in the United Provinces, under the British Raj. Awadhi was the language in the yard and the rooms. Her father worked his own strips of land and kept buffaloes for milk. Before dawn he squatted by the animals with a brass pail, then carried milk or ghee along the village path toward the morning buyers.

Her mother ran the household and joined fieldwork when the season demanded it. After the rains she went out to weed, ankles dusted with soil when she came back. Pushpa was tied against her hip in a cloth sling or left with an older sister on the floor near the cooking place.

She was the fourth child. One baby girl had died soon after birth, and another girl had died at two. The surviving brother went to school. The eldest sister fetched water and helped with cooking. Most mornings her mother lit a small lamp at the shrine shelf, set down a pinch of offering, and said the names of the gods while the courtyard was still cool.

In late January, Pushpa began to cough. Her breathing turned fast and shallow and her skin stayed hot. Her mother rubbed warmed mustard oil on her chest and kept her close to the fire at night. The fever did not break. On February 7, 1937, before sunrise, Pushpa died of pneumonia in her mother’s arms.
