# Debug information (not displayed on page):
# Age at death: 17
# Agreeableness (% rank): 83
# Birth date: February 22, 30674 BC
# Birth year: 30674 BC
# Climate now: Today the Ethiopian Highlands are cooler and wetter than surrounding
#   lowlands, with marked wet and dry seasons and extensive agriculture on the plateau.
#   The Rift Valley is warmer and more arid in many places, punctuated by large lakes,
#   irrigated farming, and savanna/shrubland ecosystems.
# Climate then: Around 30,674 BC (late Pleistocene), conditions in the Ethiopian Highlands/Rift
#   Valley were generally cooler than today, with reduced temperatures at altitude and
#   strong seasonality. Many parts of eastern Africa were comparatively drier during
#   this interval, though local conditions varied with elevation and proximity to Rift
#   lakes, creating pockets of wetter habitat around shorelines and river corridors.
#   The landscape likely supported mixed open habitats with scattered woodland and riparian
#   vegetation, with lake levels and wetlands fluctuating over time.
# Conscientiousness (% rank): 93
# Cultural tradition: Middle Stone Age (MSA), undifferentiated
# Death date: March 23, 30657 BC
# Environment: A high-elevation mosaic of grasslands, shrublands, and montane woodlands
#   broken by steep escarpments, river valleys, and lakes within the Rift system. People
#   would have moved between open grazing areas and wooded zones for hunting, gathering,
#   raw materials (stone), and water.

Thirty-two thousand years ago the Ethiopian Highlands and the Rift Valley were colder than the plateau is now, and the dry months bit harder. The grass on the open slopes went pale early. Water pulled back from the edges of the lakes and left bands of mud and cracked reeds. When a spring failed, you walked farther the next day.

We’ll call her Samira. She grew up moving between the open ground where people watched herds and the broken wooded places where shade held and plants stayed edible longer. She learned routes the way other children learned games: rock pools that kept water after a wind, gullies where tubers came up clean, a scatter of good stone where you could knock sharp edges from a core. She remembered who had what and who owed whom, and she used that knowledge without asking permission.

Her father left when she was small. After he went, adults spoke to her mother in a different tone, and food passed their hearth a little more slowly. Samira stopped waiting to be told. She woke before dawn, raked coals together, and brought back brush and twigs while the ground still held damp. When the band moved, she kept their things tight: hides folded, meat set apart from greens, stone wrapped so it didn’t break against other stone. People gave her work that punished mistakes.

Her mother carried the strain for years and then failed fast. Fever took her in waves. On better days she sat and worked a hide with a flake; on worse ones she lay in the shade and turned her face away from water. Samira’s partner began walking with her then. He was young enough to be dismissed by older men, but he carried weight without complaint and did what Samira told him. They moved the household closer to a strip of trees by the lake where the ground stayed cooler. Samira went back and forth to a spring in a narrow valley until her shoulders stayed sore. She brought small birds when she could get them, and crushed greens with a stone to push into her mother’s mouth. When her mother spat it out, Samira held the rim of the container to her lips until she swallowed. No one praised her for it. She didn’t look for praise.

At night she slept in short bursts. If someone stepped near their bundle of food, she sat up at once. She grew quick to anger. A laugh behind her made her snap around as if she’d been struck. She spoke sharply to children who drifted too close to her mother’s shade.

The dry season that followed was the worst she had seen. Springs shrank to muddy hollows. Hunting parties came back carrying less, talking longer. With her father gone, fewer people gave her household first pick when meat was cut. Samira and her partner left the main camp and stayed near a wet place on the valley floor where birds fed and tubers still grew. They dug with sticks and their hands, and set simple snares. They dried what they could and kept it out of reach. Her mother lay wrapped in hides under the trees, breathing hard, skin hot.

While they were there, her partner left for days with others to look for stone and to follow game sign along the escarpment. Another band came in from farther along the lake. Their people were thin and cautious. One young man offered a strip of dried meat at the edge of Samira’s fire. She took it. Later, when the camp was quiet and her mother’s breathing rasped in the dark, Samira went with him into the reeds.

By morning, people had noticed. A woman from the visiting band and a woman from Samira’s own group argued over tubers and then over men, voices lifting so everyone heard. Samira tried to end it with a hard stare and a short order. The other woman did not stop. Samira struck her with an open hand and then, without thinking, with the stone she was holding. The blow split skin. Blood ran down the woman’s cheek and onto her neck.

Men grabbed Samira’s arms and shoved her back. She fought them until someone wrenched her shoulder and she went still. The injured woman’s kin crowded in close, talking over one another. Samira stood with her jaw tight and said little. When the shouting finally thinned out, she gave up a good scraper and handed over part of what she had gathered. No one touched her mother. No one offered help.

After that, Samira stayed edged like a flake. She slept even less. She kept climbing for food when others waited out the heat. She went alone more often, moving fast, not calling for anyone to follow.

Near the end of another dry season she climbed above camp to check the snares and cut across to a patch of shrubs that held small seeds. The slope was broken rock and loose grit. She carried a bundle strap across her chest and stepped from ledge to ledge without slowing. A foothold crumbled under her weight. She dropped into a shallow gully and hit her head on stone.

They found her on her side with dust on her lips and the strap twisted under her shoulder. Her eyes were open. She did not move when they touched her. She did not wake.
