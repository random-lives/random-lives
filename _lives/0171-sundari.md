#     sex: M
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 29
#     connection: Escalates after years of money strain and grief from child deaths;

#       withholding grain/cash, and beatings—peaking across late 20s to early 30s.
#     incident: domestic_violence
#   - age: 32
#     connection: A drought/price-spike year intensifies conflict over debt and household

#     incident: domestic_violence
#   - age: 45
#     connection: Immediately following husband’s death, affinal kin restrict her claims
#       on land/grain; she borrows for food and seed, then becomes trapped in high-interest
#       debt and must hire out for farm labor.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 48
#     connection: Debt rolls over through multiple seasons; she sells remaining small

#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Lower physical bargaining power and higher vulnerability during domestic
#       violence; contributes to fatigue and musculoskeletal pain that later feeds substance
#       use.
#     scene: In fieldwork she is assigned lighter but longer-duration tasks (weeding
#       close to the ground, carrying smaller loads) and is mocked by a sister-in-law
#       during disputes; she compensates by working fast in short bursts when watched.
#     timing: ages 14–35 (married adulthood)
#     trait: Very short stature (0th percentile)
#   - consequence: Household conflict and reputational damage, making it easier for
#       affinal kin to justify restricting her support after widowhood.
#     scene: Forgets to secure grain jars or misplaces sickles; starts tasks but leaves
#       them half-done, drawing criticism from older women and triggering arguments
#       about her 'carelessness' and waste.
#     timing: ages 9–54 (lifelong, most visible in busy seasons)
#     trait: Low conscientiousness (17th percentile)
#   - consequence: Weaker social buffer against domestic violence and later economic
#       crisis; fewer reliable reciprocal ties when she ends up living alone.
#     scene: Avoids women’s courtyard talk and marketplace chatter; when stressed, withdraws
#       rather than seeking allies, even when that would help her position in household
#       disputes.
#     timing: ages 14–54
#     trait: Low extraversion (23rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Earns some quiet trust from a few neighbors/moneylender’s clerk,
#       but also leaves her less able to 'game' kin politics that determine access to
#       land and stores.
#     scene: Refuses to cheat neighbors on measures or lie about debts; when borrowing
#       grain she insists on clear terms and repays small amounts as soon as she can,
#       even when it hurts.
#     timing: ages 20–49 (especially during debt years)
#     trait: High honesty-humility (82nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Improves day-to-day survival and negotiation, but cannot fully overcome
#       structural constraints of widowhood, low status, and addiction.
#     scene: Quickly learns which moneylender terms are dangerous, notices patterns
#       in rainfall and prices, and devises practical workarounds (staggered gleaning
#       routes, mixing foods to stretch grain).
#     timing: ages 18–49
#     trait: High intelligence (79th percentile)
#   - consequence: Worsens marital conflict and domestic violence risk, damages reputation
#       and creditworthiness, contributes to isolation and the slide into precarious
#       living after widowhood.
#     scene: Begins with small doses taken for pain, sleeplessness, and grief; progresses
#       to daily use, morning tremor/irritability without it, and occasional neglect
#       of tasks or selling household items to obtain more.
#     timing: onset ages 24–30; most severe ages 40–54
#     trait: Substance use disorder (clinically significant; opium/poppy preparation
#       and/or alcohol)
# number_of_children: '3'
# number_of_siblings: '1'
# occupation: 'Household worker (domestic production: cooking, childcare, water/fuel,
#   food processing) + regular farm labor (weeding/harvest) as main work'
# religion: Village Hindu household puja + local gram-devata/goddess shrine worship
#   (offerings, vows/fasts, festivals; folk protections)
# sibling_ages_at_death:
# - 0
# sibling_sexes:
# - M
# structured_incidents:
# - event: After her husband’s death, the small household plot and access to shared
#     family grain stores were cut off; she fell into debt to a village moneylender
#     to cover food, seed, and basic obligations, and for several seasons she survived
#     by hiring out for weeding/harvest work and selling small livestock/utensils.
#   reasoning: A widow living alone/with minor dependents in a low-middle household
#     faced high odds of debt, food insecurity, and loss of support, especially with
#     illness and addiction expenses.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 44–49
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: During recurrent disputes over money and her husband’s drinking/temper, he
#     beat her with his hands and a stick on multiple occasions, leaving bruises and
#     forcing her at times to sleep in another part of the house or at a neighbor’s
#     until tensions cooled.
#   reasoning: Wife-beating and physical partner violence were historically widespread
#     and often socially tolerated; her low conscientiousness and substance use disorder
#     could increase marital conflict and escalation risk.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 26–34
#   type: domestic_violence

Sundari was born on December 8, 1497, in the thorn-scrub country inland from the Gulf of Khambhat, where Gujarati-speaking villages paid revenue through local intermediaries to the Gujarat Sultanate. Her family kept the routines of village Hindu life: a small smear of red earth on a stone for the gram-devata near the edge of the settlement, lamp soot on the beam above the hearth, and offerings of millet bread and buttermilk on fast days when the women asked for protection.

She grew up in a joint household where the courtyard belonged to elders. Sangaji, her grandfather, sat on a low plank in the mornings and listened to talk about seed and fodder. Kesarba, her grandmother, decided which grain jar would be opened and how much water could be spent on washing cloth. Sundari was very short even as a child; she learned to carry smaller pots more trips instead of one heavy trip. She became quick with her hands and eyes. When she helped in the field she could spot weeds in the crop rows faster than older girls, and she remembered which neighbor’s well turned brackish first in a dry spell.

Her father, Jetha, worked a village service craft and took on whatever farming the household managed. He left early on some days with tools wrapped in cloth, returning with a bit of grain or a coin, and sometimes nothing but dust on his ankles. He expected things to be where he had left them. Sundari misplaced his knife once and he made her stand by the doorway until it was found. Her mother, Rami, pulled her away afterward and set her to pounding grain, not speaking but keeping her close.

In 1500, Rami bore a son. The baby, Kalo, lived only a short time. That evening Kesarba took a pinch of vermilion and marked the threshold, and the next morning she walked Sundari to the village goddess stone. They left a smear of ghee and a few grains of pearl millet, and Kesarba tied a black thread around Sundari’s wrist. After that, Rami kept a small clay lamp burning longer on certain nights, watching its flame as if it could hold the house together.

Sangaji died in 1510. Without him, arguments in the courtyard lasted longer. Kesarba corrected Sundari’s work more sharply. Sundari learned where to sit to avoid being pulled into every exchange: on the low edge of the cattle trough in the late afternoon, when the air cooled and the goats pushed their noses into fodder. She liked the moment when water first hit her hands at the well, and she delayed lifting the pot to enjoy the coolness. It earned her scolding.

Her marriage was arranged in 1511 with Natha from a nearby village, close enough that the dialect and customs felt familiar. She walked there with a small bundle of cloth and a few brass items. In her husband’s house she had to learn a different layout of jars and a different rhythm of labor, and older women watched her for mistakes. She rose before sunrise, swept, lit the cooking fire, and went out to weed when the men said the field needed it. She never became someone who enjoyed the cluster of women gossiping at the well. She did her drawing of water quickly and spoke in short replies.

Jivi, her first child, was born in 1513. Sundari carried the girl on her hip while she winnowed grain, and later set her down under a charpai shade while she worked. Jivi liked to sing fragments of bhajans she heard during festivals, nonsense words mixed with the names of Krishna. Sundari laughed once when the child called a stern auntie “buffalo-face,” and then clapped a hand over the girl’s mouth as if the words could be put back.

A second daughter, Ganga, was born in 1516 and died soon after birth. Sundari washed the infant with warm water and turmeric and handed her over for the rites without argument. Within the year, in 1517, Jivi fell ill during the fever season and did not recover. After that Sundari took vows more seriously. She fasted on certain days, ate plain food, and brought small offerings—coconut, a pinch of rice, a thread—when she went to the goddess stone. She also began keeping a little packet of poppy preparation in the fold of cloth at her waist, first for pain in her back and the sleeplessness that followed Jivi’s death.

Her son, Kanu, was born in 1519. The house eased its grip on her for a time. She still worked in the fields during peak seasons, bent low in the rows because her height made it easier, her hands moving in quick bursts. She was clever enough to bargain for a fair share of gleaned stalks and to judge the measure of grain in a pot by sound. She also left tasks unfinished when no one stood over her. A half-latched jar drew rats. A pot left too close to the fire cracked. Each mistake became a reason for someone to speak over her.

By 1523, her use of intoxicants had shifted from occasional to regular. She bought small amounts through a neighbor’s contact, sometimes trading a bit of clarified butter or a brass bangle. On mornings without it she moved slowly, sharp in speech. Natha drank too, and money kept slipping away—into drink, into fees, into the small costs of keeping a household’s standing. Sundari did not lie easily and she refused to pretend a debt was smaller than it was. That honesty gave her no advantage inside the house.

Between 1526 and 1531, Natha beat her repeatedly during fights about grain and cash. Once, after he accused her of hiding money for herself, he struck her with his hands and then with a stick. Bruises spread along her arms. She slept that night on the packed-earth floor near the cooking area. Another time he hit her in the courtyard in front of a sister-in-law who laughed and called her “little stump.” Sundari went to Hira, a neighbor woman, and stayed there two nights, helping grind grain in exchange for shelter. When she returned, elders spoke of harmony and duty, and Natha stayed quiet for a few weeks before the cycle began again.

The 1530s brought hard seasons. Some years the rains failed early, fodder thinned, and the price of grain rose. Other years brought sickness through the villages, with coughs and fevers that took children and old people. Sundari watched these shifts carefully, counting days between market trips, listening to what men said about what they owed. She could see trouble approaching and still failed to prepare in the ways others wanted—forgetting to stash kindling, losing a tool, letting the poppy packet empty and then scrambling for it.

Her mother, Rami, died in 1524, and her father, Jetha, in 1530. News arrived by messenger and by visiting kin, and Sundari did the expected mourning, but their deaths left her with fewer people willing to step into her marriage disputes. Kanu grew into a young man and began to work more independently. He respected his mother’s quick mind but disliked her habits. He avoided speaking to her when he smelled the smoke of her preparation.

Natha died in 1541. His death did not make Sundari safer. In the weeks that followed, decisions about land and grain stores hardened. Men in the wider kin group said she had no right to a share beyond what they chose to give. Kanu’s marriage brought Sona into the house, and Sona pushed for resources to stay with her husband’s new household. By 1542, Sundari left and lived alone in a small dwelling at the edge of the village.

From 1542 to 1546, debt tightened around her. She borrowed grain from Bhaidar, the moneylender and dealer, with terms she understood and could not escape. To cover interest she sold small things: a cooking pot, then an old brass plate, then a goat. She hired herself out for weeding and harvest work and came home with chaff in her hair. Some evenings she sat outside Hira’s doorway, accepting a cup of watered buttermilk without conversation. When she had a few coins she bought more poppy preparation, and the next morning she could move without trembling.

In 1548, after another poor season, she stopped being invited to certain courtyard gatherings. She still attended major festivals, standing at the edge with other widows. She carried a small lamp to the goddess stone and left a pinch of rice and a strip of cloth. She liked the first bite of hot millet bread when it came off the griddle, eaten alone, before she had to think of the next day.

In 1552 she developed a harsh cough that did not resolve. She continued to fetch water until she could not carry even the smaller pot. Hira brought her thin gruel once, and Sona sent word that Kanu would not take her back into his house. Sundari died on October 18, 1552.

Women washed her body, rubbed it with oil, and placed it on a simple bier. Her kin carried her to the cremation place outside the settlement, and the fire was lit with a small offering of ghee and a final pinch of rice.
