Rosa María Martínez was born on August 22, 1747, in the upper Sinú country, where the Spanish crown ruled through distant officials in Cartagena and local priests who traveled river routes. Her family spoke Spanish, prayed to the Virgin and saints, and worked for day wages on other people’s fields and clearings along the wet forest edge.

Her older sister Isabel Martínez arrived in 1745 and treated Rosa as an inconvenience from the start. Isabel took the first cup of sweetened drink when there was panela, and she kept the better place by the cooking fire. Rosa answered back, loud and quick, and their mother snapped at both of them. Rosa’s father left before dawn to join other men cutting brush or planting for a patron, and he returned with mud up to his calves in the rainy months. When the river rose it swallowed footpaths and left standing pools. Mosquitoes thickened. Children scratched until their skin broke.

A baby sister born in 1749 died the same year. Rosa grew up hearing her mother say the child’s name during prayer and then stop. In 1752 another sister was born, and in 1754 that toddler died after days of diarrhea and vomiting. Rosa watched her mother boil water with leaves and salt, watched her father pace outside. She carried a calabash of water and spilled it in the rush, and her mother slapped her hand hard enough to sting for hours. In 1755 a brother, Juan Martínez, was born. He lived. He learned to swing a machete early and followed their father on short jobs.

Two more girls followed—one in 1758, another in 1761. Both died in 1762 during a season of fevers. The household stayed small and tight, and Rosa’s mother held the line with prayers and chores. Rosa learned to wash in the river and on boards, rubbing cloth with ash or soap when they had it, beating it, wringing it, laying it on bushes to dry. She liked the part at the end, when the cloth smelled clean and the folds stacked neatly. She also liked talking while she worked. She could chatter through a whole morning, and when other women laughed she felt steadier.

In the 1750s and 1760s new demands reached even the upper Sinú. Officials and their men came more often, asking questions, counting, pressing monopolies on tobacco and aguardiente. Prices shifted. Men complained that fines and confiscations ate what little they earned. Rosa did not follow the arguments, but she noticed when her father came home angry and when her mother watered down the drink.

By her teens Rosa went to better-off households to wash, sweep, and scrub. She carried bundles on her head, her skirts tucked up to keep them from the mud. She hated stepping into other women’s kitchens and seeing clay pots she could not afford, then being corrected for small things. When someone talked down to her, she talked back, then regretted it and tried to mend the trouble with extra work.

In 1766 she began a relationship with Tomás Herrera, a rural laborer who cleared land and planted for wages and sometimes tended cattle for a ranch owner. They married with the priest when he passed through. Rosa liked Tomás’s hands—broad, quick, always moving. She also argued with him over small sums and over who had promised what to whom. Tomás drank hard on paydays, then spent weeks sober and silent. Rosa watched him for signs and pushed him when she felt ignored.

Their first child, a daughter, María Herrera, was born in 1767. Rosa washed clothes again within weeks, binding her breasts and shifting the baby to whoever would hold her while Rosa worked. A second daughter was born in 1769 and died in 1770. Three sons followed in 1771, 1773, and 1775, each dying at birth. Rosa prayed louder after each burial, then snapped at neighbors who offered explanations. She kept going because there was no other choice. In 1777 she bore a son, José Herrera, who survived. She fed him mashed plantain and broth, and when he cried at night she shook him too roughly once, then clutched him tight and stayed awake until morning.

In 1781 rumors of revolt and taxes spread from far away. Men at the riverside talked of the Comuneros, of towns rising, of officials backing down and then pressing again. Rosa cared less about the politics than the way it made Tomás tense. He avoided strangers and kept his pay hidden, then accused Rosa of losing coins. She accused him of drinking them. Their arguments brought neighbors to the door.

In 1781 Rosa’s youngest child, Antonia Herrera, was born. Antonia lived, sharp-eyed and quick to mimic Rosa’s expressions. Rosa liked taking Antonia with her to the river, pointing out where the current was fastest and where snakes lay in branches after floods.

In 1786, at age thirty-nine, Rosa finished a washing job at a better-off house near the Sinú and started home before the afternoon rain. Someone came up behind her on the path and yanked away her bundle—clean linens, a bar of soap, and the coins she had been paid. The thief ran into the brush. Rosa shouted until her throat hurt, then went back to the household with empty hands. The mistress stared at her and demanded repayment. Rosa argued, then begged, then argued again. She worked two extra weeks at half pay to settle it. After that she tied her bundles with extra cord and walked with other women when she could, even when their pace annoyed her.

In 1795 her mother’s legs swelled and pitted under the thumb. Fever came in waves. Rosa, forty-eight, took over the care. She carried maize porridge and broth, bathed her mother with warmed water, and washed bedding stained with sweat and stool. She scrubbed until her knuckles cracked, then wrapped her hands in cloth and kept scrubbing. She slept poorly and startled at small sounds. Tomás complained that Rosa spent too many hours away, then softened when he saw the state of her mother. Rosa refused help from women she distrusted and then snapped at them for not coming. She set a small image of the Virgin near the sleeping mat and made Antonia say prayers with her at dusk.

In the late 1790s word of smallpox prevention reached the region. A visiting official spoke of vaccination. Some families sought it. Others feared it. Rosa listened, then decided the matter was for priests and patrons and kept her children close during outbreaks of sickness, washing hands and boiling water when she remembered, then forgetting when work pressed.

Isabel died in 1806. Rosa did not cry in public. She criticized Isabel’s husband for taking Isabel’s best pot and then, days later, carried him food anyway. In 1809 Tomás Herrera fell ill after days of chills and stomach cramps. He died that year. Rosa handled the burial arrangements through the parish and the help of kin, then faced the debts that Tomás had carried quietly. In 1810 she fell behind on maize and salt. The holder of the rented plot demanded payment. Rosa argued, lost her temper, and was turned out. She moved into a smaller hut on borrowed ground and lived from irregular washing and cleaning.

The independence wars brought more armed men and more demands. José avoided impressment by staying out in the countryside for stretches. Miguel Martínez, Rosa’s youngest brother, drifted in and out with stories of militia and roadblocks, and he died in 1812. Juan lived longer, stubborn and hard, offering Rosa a little help and then reminding her of it. Rosa took the help and resented the reminder.

Antonia died in 1825. After that, Rosa stayed mostly alone, with kin living nearby but not under her roof. She still rose early, washed her face, and combed her hair with care. She liked sitting near the riverbank in the late afternoon when the heat eased, listening to talk from passing canoes. She disliked gossip that circled back to her as criticism, and she confronted it directly when she heard it.

In May 1827, during the early Republic’s new administrative order and renewed local demands, Rosa fell sick with severe diarrhea. She tried to keep working, then could not stand. She drank water and weak broth and could not keep it down. She died on May 15, 1827, at age seventy-nine, in her hut near the Sinú, with nearby kin arriving too late to do more than prepare her body for burial.
