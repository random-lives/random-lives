Rosa María Martínez entered the world on August 22, 1747, in the upper Sinú country, where the Spanish Crown governed through distant officials in the Province of Cartagena and local priests and notables kept order in scattered settlements. Her family spoke Spanish and lived in a thatch-roof house set back from the river, in forested hills where wet-season floods turned paths into mud and mosquitoes rose from every pool.

Her father, Tomás Martínez, worked as a peón. He took clearing jobs, planted for other men, cut posts, carried loads, and waited to be hired again. When there was no work he planted a small patch wherever he could get permission. Rosa’s mother, Inés Pérez, kept the household running and brought in coins by washing and mending for people with more shirts than hands. Rosa grew up watching her mother scrub clothes at the river’s edge and beat them on a board, then hang them on lines between trees. She copied what she saw. Before she was ten she carried water, tended coals, and learned how to rinse cloth without tearing it.

She was the second child in a line of eight. Her older sister, Ana, helped with the little ones. After Rosa came more girls, then two boys. Three of those younger children died before they could talk well. A tiny grave near the house got reopened and smoothed over more than once. Her mother kept working through pregnancies, and Rosa took on tasks that were too heavy for a child. She learned to talk fast and to push through crowds at church feasts, to trade sharp words with other girls, and to keep moving even when fear sat in her chest.

Officials visited more often when she was a girl. Men talked about new taxes and new rules and the monopoly on aguardiente. Sometimes soldiers or armed men came through in small groups. People hid jugs, hid tobacco, and argued about who had to pay and who could get out of it. Rosa listened without grasping the whole of it. She understood the part that mattered: some weeks the price of salt jumped, or a man with authority demanded something that had not been demanded before.

Rosa did not learn letters. She knew the prayers by ear and the rhythm of Mass when the priest came through, and she knew the saints by their images. She carried a rosary that had been patched with string.

In her late teens she began washing for households beyond her hamlet. Better-off families paid in coins when they had them, or with maize, salt, or a length of cloth. She walked early, barefoot or in worn sandals, with a bundle on her head and a smaller child sometimes clinging to her skirt. She moved easily among people and spoke with confidence, but she also took slights personally and stayed awake at night running over arguments she had had in the daytime.

She married a man named Juan de Dios Herrera, a farm laborer who took the same kinds of jobs her father did. He drank when there was liquor. He worked hard when he had work. They rented a small plot from a man who lived closer to the river, and they built a hut and planted what they could. When rain came heavy, the Sinú rose and spread over low ground. Their paths disappeared. Maize spoiled in storage if they did not keep it high and dry. After floods came fevers.

Rosa bore seven children. The first, a daughter, Inés, lived and grew strong. The second, another girl, died at about a year. Then came a run of boys—four of them—three dying within days or weeks. The last child was a daughter, Josefa. Rosa did not talk about the dead children for long. She washed their swaddling cloths the same way she washed everything else, hard and fast, as if the cloth itself had offended her. When someone offered advice that did not fit her life, she answered sharply.

By the early 1780s talk of unrest spread up from the interior. Men spoke of the Comuneros and of tax collectors, and of petitions and punishments. In Rosa’s area, no one marched under banners, but officials tightened their grip. People watched the roads. Some men took to the bush for days to avoid being pressed for service or dragged into disputes.

In her late thirties, Rosa took a washing job from a household that kept more linens than most. She spent the day at the river, scrubbing, rinsing, and laying pieces on stones to dry. She wrapped the clean cloth into a tight bundle with her soap and the few coins she had been paid, and she started home along a path that cut through wet brush. Someone came up behind her and yanked the bundle from her arms. She shouted and ran a few steps, then stopped. She returned home with nothing but wet hands. The next day she walked back to the household and told what happened. She spoke quickly, repeating details, blaming the path and the bandits and the men who wandered through. The woman she worked for demanded repayment anyway. Rosa argued until her voice went hoarse, then agreed to wash again to cover part of the loss.

In her mid-forties her mother’s body began to fail. Inés Pérez’s legs swelled and pitted under Rosa’s fingers. Fevers came in waves. Rosa carried food to her mother’s hut and cleaned the bedding after bouts of diarrhea and sweat. She hauled water and washed her mother’s clothes, then walked back to her own children and her own cooking pot. She did not speak gently during this work. She ordered her siblings to bring firewood, scolded them when they arrived late, and fought with her younger sisters over who had promised what. When her mother’s fever broke, Rosa sat on a low stool and watched for the next spell of sickness.

Vaccination talk reached the region in the years that followed. A priest or an official would arrive with news from Cartagena or from towns downriver, and some families lined up, some refused. Rosa listened and judged by what she saw in front of her. If a child looked strong after the procedure, she said it was worth it. If a child got sick, she said the man with the lancet had brought trouble into the village.

Juan de Dios died when Rosa was in her early sixties. The details mattered less than the immediate results. His labor stopped. Debts remained. She owed for maize and salt, and the man who rented them their plot wanted his due. Rosa argued, promised, begged, then fell behind. She gave up the rented ground and moved into a smaller hut closer to kin. She washed more often, took cleaning work when she could, and accepted small help from relatives even when it shamed her. She slept poorly and startled awake at sounds outside. When a neighbor asked a simple question, Rosa snapped back, then later tried to repair the damage with food or a favor.

The wars of independence shook the wider region. Men with weapons moved along routes toward the coast and back again. Rumors traveled faster than facts. Some young men from nearby joined militias; others hid. Rosa kept to her work and watched her stores. When armed groups passed, she stayed indoors and sent her daughters to fetch water early.

By the 1820s new authorities claimed the country. They spoke of Colombia and new laws. In Rosa’s settlement, officials changed names and demanded papers few people had. She did not understand the politics, but she understood when men tried to take a son’s labor or claim a portion of a harvest.

Old age left Rosa alone in a small hut near kin. Her surviving children had their own households. She still washed small loads for pay when her hands allowed it. She complained about pain in her joints and about the damp. When rain came hard, she kept her few possessions up on wooden pegs.

In May of 1827 she developed severe diarrhea. Water ran through her faster than she could drink it. She squatted behind her hut, weak and shaking, and called for help in a sharp voice that faded into a rasp. Kin brought water and a thin maize gruel, but she could not keep it down. On May 15, 1827, at seventy-nine years old, Rosa María Martínez died in her hut near the upper Sinú, her body left depleted by the infection that had spread through the settlement after the rains.
