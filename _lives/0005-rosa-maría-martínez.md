Rosa María Martínez came into the world on August 22, 1747, in a hamlet above the Sinú River in the interior of the Province of Cartagena, under the Spanish crown. Her family spoke Spanish, went to Mass when a priest rode through, and kept saints’ cards and a rosary wrapped in cloth to protect them from damp. They were mestiza people of the river and forest edge, tied to Spanish law and parish ritual and to the daily demands of clearing, planting, and finding paid work.

Her father, Tomás Martínez, left before daylight to work as a peón. He chopped brush for other men’s fields, planted maize for wages, and took whatever day work came. Rosa’s mother, Lucía Pérez, hauled water, cooked, mended, and found small earnings. She washed for better-off households, traded eggs and plantains, and took sewing when someone had cloth. Rosa was the second child. An older sister, Inés, carried her on one hip while Lucía stirred pots and scolded chickens away from drying cassava. More children followed. The girls learned to sweep the packed earth, rinse clothes in the river, and keep smoke from the hearth off a baby’s face. Two of the girls died as toddlers. Rosa watched her mother wrap small bodies and say prayers without stopping the day’s work.

Officials began to show up more often on the tracks along the river during Rosa’s childhood. Men talked about tighter rules, new taxes, and the aguardiente monopoly. A guard might turn up at a small sale and ask questions. Tobacco and liquor prices shifted. Tomás complained at night about what a trip to the coast now cost and how easy it was for a poor man to fall into trouble with a clerk who wanted papers. Rosa heard it, but she kept her mind on the next chore and on the baby crying. She ran errands quickly and talked to everyone on the way, then forgot what she had been sent to fetch. Lucía slapped her hand for it more than once.

When Rosa was a young woman, she started washing regularly for a household near a river landing that received traders and muleteers. The work meant long hours with wet cloth biting into her hands, lye stinging her knuckles, and mosquitoes rising from shaded pools. She liked being out among voices. She learned who had quarrels, who had money, and whose son had disappeared up the river. She also picked fights. If a woman accused her of leaving a stain, Rosa snapped back and said the stain had been there before. The argument carried down the bank and into the yard.

She entered a union with Pedro Jiménez, a laborer who followed clearing work and planting jobs. They made a home on rented ground with a small garden patch, a few hens, and a cooking place under a palm-thatch roof. The parish priest visited enough that their first child was carried for baptism with a godmother holding the baby tight against the heat. Rosa gave birth seven times. Three daughters and four sons. One girl lived into old age; another died at one year. Three boys died at birth or within days. Two sons grew to adulthood and took on work along the river.

Rosa’s days settled into a pattern. Before sunrise she chewed a piece of cassava, drank weak coffee when there was any, and set a pot on the fire. She walked to the river with a bundle of clothes on her head, sometimes with her eldest daughter at her side. She beat cloth against a board and rubbed it with soap she made when she had fat and ashes. She sang hymns under her breath when she felt watched and quickened her hands when someone stood nearby. She enjoyed salted fish when a trader brought it and she had coins. She sat on a low stool in the doorway at dusk and ate plantain with a pinch of salt, listening for the sound of a canoe pole on the river.

Flooding shaped the year. In wet months the Sinú rose and spread into low ground, soaking stored maize and turning paths into slick clay. Rosa cursed it, then waded anyway, skirts tied up, holding a child’s hand hard enough to make them complain. After floods came fevers. People shook and sweated. Rosa knew which herbs to boil and which prayers to say while she rubbed a child’s chest with warm oil. She also blamed the wrong people when fear pressed in. If a neighbor’s boy coughed near her baby, she drove him off and started a quarrel with his mother.

News of unrest reached even the interior. When Rosa was in her early thirties, men talked about the Comuneros and taxes, and there was talk of officials being run out of towns. In her hamlet nothing turned into an open rising, but the talk changed how people behaved. Some hid aguardiente or bought it through friends. Others kept quiet when strangers asked questions. Pedro stayed away from arguments, but Rosa did not. She spoke too loudly at the river landing and Pedro pulled her arm and told her to stop before she brought trouble to their door.

In her late thirties, on a hot day when the river sat low and brown between banks, Rosa finished a washing job at a better-off household near the Sinú. She wrapped cleaned linens and soap in a cloth, tucked her pay into the fold, and started back along a narrow path. She stopped to speak to a man she knew and laughed at a crude joke. When she turned, her bundle was gone. She ran down the path and shouted. Nothing. She returned to her client with empty hands and a voice sharp from anger. The woman’s face tightened, and Rosa argued instead of begging, insisting it was not her doing. She lost that household’s work for months and had to take smaller jobs, washing for families who paid in food scraps and old cloth.

In her mid-forties, Rosa’s mother grew slow. Lucía’s legs swelled, and fevers came in waves. Tomás was dead by then, and Lucía lived in a small hut nearby. Rosa carried food to her—maize porridge, plantain, a bit of salt when she had it. She bathed Lucía with warmed water, lifted her onto fresh bedding, and scrubbed soiled cloth until her arms ached. Lucía complained and Rosa snapped back, then stayed anyway, sitting close and flicking flies off her mother’s face. When Lucía’s belly filled with fluid and her breathing rasped, Rosa slept there on the floor so she could rise to fetch water and wipe her mother’s mouth.

By the time Rosa reached her fifties, vaccination and inoculation talk came through the parish. A traveling official and a priest spoke of protection against smallpox, and some families brought children to be marked. Rosa watched closely, suspicious of needles and strangers. She still took her surviving children when her eldest daughter insisted. She held a boy’s arm still while he cried and later complained loudly that the priest’s mule smelled worse than the pigs.

Pedro died when Rosa was in her early sixties. He collapsed after days of fever during the rainy season, and he was buried quickly on damp ground. Without his wages, Rosa fell behind. She owed for maize and salt. The man who rented them their plot demanded payment. Rosa argued, then had nothing to give. She moved into a smaller hut on another family’s land, close enough to kin that a cousin, Sebastián Pérez, could bring a handful of maize when her pot was empty. She took whatever washing work she could find and carried loads even when her back pinched. Her temper made it harder. She insulted a woman who tried to bargain her down and lost that client. She came home shaking with worry and then turned on her daughter for leaving a gourd uncovered.

The wars that tore through New Granada reached her as rumors, recruits passing, and shortages. Men with weapons traveled the tracks. Food prices jumped. One of her surviving sons, Mateo Jiménez, avoided forced service by staying deep in clearing work upriver for a season, returning thin and watchful. After independence, new officials spoke in the same Spanish but carried different papers. They asked for men, for supplies, for obedience. Rosa cared about the result: whether there was salt in the house, whether the river path was safe, whether a stranger would demand a chicken.

In old age she lived alone in a small hut near kin. Her eldest daughter, Teresa, lived close enough to bring food and check on her, but Rosa insisted on keeping her own space. She kept a clay pot for water, a gourd cup, and a small bundle with her rosary and a scapular wrapped in cloth. She still walked to the river when her knees allowed it, sitting on a low bank to rinse a few pieces of cloth for a neighbor in exchange for cassava. She argued with children who ran too close to her doorway and then called one back to give him a roasted plantain end.

In May of 1827, during the wet season, diarrhea hit her hard. She could not keep water down. Teresa brought rice broth and tried to make her drink. Rosa pushed the cup away and cursed at her, then begged for water minutes later. Her mouth cracked, her hands trembled, and she soiled her bedding again and again. Nearby kin came to sit for a moment, speak a prayer, and leave. Rosa died on May 15, 1827, in her hut near the Sinú, emptied by dysentery and dehydration.
