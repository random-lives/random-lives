#     name: Hermann
#     narrative_role: Dependent peasant tenant and mixed farmer owing labor services.
#       Present at the birth but not a hands-on caregiver to a newborn; his role is
#       providing, negotiating dues, and arranging with priest/neighbors for rites and
#       burial. Relationship quality with Elisabet is necessarily indirect—defined by
#       urgency, worry for mother and child, and later remembrance.

#   - death_year: 1242
#     name: Mechthild
#     narrative_role: Household manager and farm worker; primary caregiver in general.
#       With Elisabet, her relationship is bound to the ordeal of labor and immediate
#       loss. If she survived the birth (assumed), she would later carry the emotional
#       weight and memory, especially after the later stillbirth of Gertrud.

#       household’s grief and to help her mother with childcare and small tasks. Likely
#       a familiar presence at the cradle and during the hurried baptism attempt; later,
#       her own early adult death would be remembered by the family as another blow.

Elisabet was born on 12 July 1198 in a village near the lakes and fields of the Mansfeld country, in the eastern lands of the Holy Roman Empire. Her family spoke Middle High German and lived under a lord’s rights and dues, owing labor on demesne strips and payments in grain and small stock. The parish church ordered the week and the year: Sunday Mass when the work allowed, feast days, fasting, and short prayers learned by ear. A sprig of blessed greenery from a past feast hung near the doorbeam; holy water was kept for sickness.

Her father, Hermann, held a peasant tenancy and worked mixed fields and animals. Rye and oats stood on the higher ground; a few pigs and hens fed on scraps and mast. Her mother, Mechthild, ran the household. She spun flax when the light held, stirred pottage over the hearth, and kept the small children close while watching the yard.

Two children already lived in the house: Adelheid, born in 1193, and Heinrich, born in 1195. When labor came hard in midsummer heat, a neighbor woman, Liese, was sent for. The delivery dragged; the child came with no strong cry. Hermann went for the priest, Pfarrer Otto, but the midwife used water at once and spoke the baptismal words over the infant.

Elisabet died the same day. They wrapped her in cloth, carried her to the churchyard, and buried her in consecrated ground while Otto recited the prayers for the dead.
