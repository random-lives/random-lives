Giovanna was born on August 10, 1250, in a farming household outside Grumo Appula in the countryside of Bari, in the Kingdom of Sicily. The king’s officials and local lords collected dues in grain and labor, and village life ran through the church calendar. Her family belonged to a Greek-rite community, but they spoke the local Italo-Romance speech at home and in the fields.

Her father, Matteo, held a tenant plot and worked it with his own hands. He kept a small press for olives shared with kin, and he brought wheat to the mill when the road was dry. The household was patrilocal. Matteo’s father Nicola lived under the same roof and kept accounts in his head: seed saved, rents owed, jars of oil to trade. Giovanna’s mother, Rosa, spun thread, baked bread on the hearthstone, and went out to weed and gather with the women when the crops needed it.

Their first child, Pietro, had been born in 1247 and ran between the doorway and the animals, loud and unafraid of the goats. When Rosa went into labor in August heat, Nicola sent for the village midwife and for the priest who served the Greek rite. Giovanna came small and quiet. She was baptized at home with prayers said over a bowl of water and an icon set near the bed.

By the next day her skin turned hot and mottled. Rosa tried to feed her and kept her close, and the older women washed and rewrapped her. On August 12, 1250, Giovanna died of newborn infection.
