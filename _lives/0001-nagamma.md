#     narrative_role: Agricultural laborer in a village service/artisan household; likely

#     name: Venkamma
#     narrative_role: Did domestic work and seasonal field labor. Survived the delivery
#       (as per earlier draw) but may have been exhausted from prolonged labor; her
#       bond with Nagamma was brief and bodily—labor, attempted soothing, and mourning.

Nagamma was born before dawn on March 12, 1791, in Virapura near Lingasugur, in the dry thorn-scrub country of the Raichur plain. Revenue men came through for the Deccan rulers, but her household lived by the seasons and the demands of the village headman. They spoke Kannada at home and Telugu in the market.

Her father, Ranga, worked for wages in other men's fields. The household belonged to a weaver caste, and Timma kept a loom, but weaving brought less than field labor and Ranga only sat at the loom when patrons sent cotton. Her mother, Venkamma, carried water from the well, ground grain, cooked ragi porridge, and went out for weeding and harvest when labor was hired. They lived in a patrilocal joint compound with Ranga’s parents, Timma and Timmamma. A tulasi plant stood in the courtyard, and Venkamma fed it with water each morning. On Ekadashi days she kept a fast and whispered Rama’s name while turning a small strand of beads.

When labor started, Timmamma sent for Basavva the dai. The women heated water and laid out clean cloth. The delivery dragged through the night. When Nagamma came, her skin held the dark, wet sheen of birth, but she did not cry. Basavva rubbed her back with oil, cleared her mouth with a finger, and tugged gently at her feet. Timmamma held a small brass lamp near the baby's face. No breath came.

Before sunset, Ranga dug a pit beyond the houses where the fields began. They wrapped Nagamma in cloth, placed her in the earth, and set rice and ghee at the spot before smoothing it closed.
