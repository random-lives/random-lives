Paola Andrea Orozco Martínez was born on December 14, 1990 in Chorjalé, outside Cabricán, in the high western highlands. The mornings were cold and damp. Smoke from cooking fires hung low and the pine hills stayed gray until the sun got up.

She was the fourth of eight children. The house was a narrow rectangle of concrete block and boards with a tin roof. There were no grandparents living with them. The rooms stayed crowded. Someone was always stepping over a sibling or reaching past them for a pot.

Her father left for seasonal work on the south coast. He traveled with a small bag, work clothes, and a little money folded into his pocket. He came back with sunburned skin and a cough from sleeping where men slept close together. Some trips he brought a sack of rice, a bottle of cooking oil, or used shoes for whichever child needed them. Other trips he came home with nothing to show except tiredness. Paola learned that money came in bursts and disappeared fast.

Her mother kept the house running. She washed clothes by hand, cooked, and broke up fights before they turned loud. When there was money she bought soap, sugar, and notebooks. When there wasn’t, there were tortillas and beans and greens from the yard. Paola watched her mother count what was left, then serve everyone anyway.

They were Ladino and spoke Spanish at home. On Sundays they went to an Evangelical church with a concrete floor and open windows. The pastor preached hard against drinking and fighting. The women swept the benches and wiped dust from the ledges. Paola learned hymns by hearing them. She could read short lines if she took her time, but she struggled to write. At school she copied slowly, pressing so hard the pencil point broke. When the teacher made them write the same sentence again and again, Paola quit halfway down the page and stared at the paper, angry and bored at the same time.

In 1998 the rains came heavy for days. Water ran down the slopes and the earth gave way. A slide cut the path that people used to reach the road. For a while no pickup truck came up and the minibus stopped running to the nearest stop. Her mother kept the children inside when the thunder cracked close. Paola still stood in the doorway watching the yard turn to mud. When the rain eased she followed her older brothers to look at the damage. She talked the whole way, asking what was under the fallen dirt, asking where the water went, asking who would fix it. One brother told her to shut up. She did not. She kept talking, not to annoy him on purpose, but because silence made her restless.

When she was eleven and twelve, work got harder to find. The men in the area depended on harvest seasons and day labor, and wages dropped. Her father stayed away longer and returned with less. Her mother made meals smaller and sent Paola to borrow salt or lime from neighbors. Paola was good at that kind of request. She greeted people first, smiled, remembered names, and made a short visit feel like company instead of need.

As she grew, she went to Cabricán more often for market days and errands. She liked the crowd and the noise and the rows of goods she did not see at home. She finished primary school and then stopped. The fees were not high, but the household needed her at home. She missed days to watch younger siblings, to carry water when the tap ran dry, and to help her mother wash and cook. Nobody argued about it for long. It was a closed door, handled like any other problem.

In 2008 food prices rose and stayed high. At the market her mother argued over the cost of maize and beans and came home quiet. Paola started taking cleaning work through relatives in town. She left early and walked to where transport passed, money tucked into her clothes. Robberies were common on the route. People warned her to keep cash out of sight and not to answer back if a man started trouble. She followed rules when they were clear, but she was not careful with details. She forgot rags in corners. She missed a dirty spot on a blouse. She left a window unlatched once and a dog got into a kitchen. The woman she worked for shouted at her until Paola’s face went hot. Paola apologized quickly and did the work again, fast and rough, more focused on being done than doing it perfectly. The next week she made the same mistake with a different task and got another scolding.

Cleaning moved her between households. In one house she learned how to mop without leaving water behind. In another she learned to fold towels the way the employer liked, even when it made no sense to her. She watched schoolchildren leave with clean uniforms and packed lunches. She went home to feed her younger siblings before they left for school. Her reading improved because she handled labels, lists, and church pamphlets. Her writing did not. If she had to fill out a form, she took it to someone who could write faster. She did not pretend otherwise. She laughed it off, then stood close and watched where her name went.

She married in her twenties. They married civilly and in church, because that mattered in her congregation and in her own sense of being taken seriously. Her husband worked wherever he could—construction when a crew needed hands, then transport and odd jobs. Paola kept cleaning and took childcare when it paid better. They had three children, two girls and a boy.

At home she worked by habit, not by plan. Meals came out on time, but laundry piled up. She lost papers and then found them weeks later under folded clothes. She forgot appointments and had to rush, pulling a child by the hand and arriving late, breathing hard. Her husband got angry about it more than once, calling her careless. She argued back and then, just as quickly, started talking about something else. She did not stay quiet and stew. She filled the house with noise, questions, and chatter, even when the mood was bad.

From 2012 into the next few years, rains in the region became irregular and prices in the market swung. Some weeks vegetables were scarce. Some weeks the price of staples jumped and stayed there. Her answer was to add work. She took a caregiving job with an older woman in town, cooking and helping her bathe. The pay was steady and the woman sent leftovers home with her. Paola did not save carefully, but steady money changed the house anyway. They replaced roof sheets, put in a sturdier door, and finished a concrete floor. Later they bought a secondhand refrigerator. A television came after that.

Church stayed at the center of her social life. She could not arrive and sit without greeting people. She pulled shy newcomers into conversation and asked direct questions about their children, their work, their sick relatives. She got drawn into other people’s arguments because she was willing to listen and carry messages. Sometimes she made it worse by talking too much and repeating something she should have left alone. When that happened she went back the next day to smooth it over, standing in a doorway and speaking fast until the other person stopped being angry.

When COVID-19 reached Guatemala, employers stopped letting outsiders into their homes. Paola lost hours and then lost jobs. The church closed for a time and then met in smaller groups. Without Sunday gatherings, she felt cut off and agitated. Money got tight again. She picked up whatever she could: washing clothes for a neighbor, selling small items, watching children for women who still had to work. At home the children stayed inside. The house turned loud, everyone talking over everyone. Paola kept them moving with simple routines. She set work on the table after lunch and read a short Bible passage out loud at night, following the lines with her finger. When she needed to send messages, she used voice notes so she would not have to spell.

Now she moves between Chorjalé and town the way she has for years, walking to the road and riding whatever transport is running. She keeps a phone with contacts who call when they need cleaning or caregiving. Her children correct her when she tries to write a message and gets stuck. On Sundays she stands outside the church after service in the thin mountain air, hair tied back, bag on her shoulder. She asks after a woman’s mother, calls out to someone crossing the yard, and tells her son to slow down before he trips on the uneven ground. Then she keeps talking, because that is how she lives: by staying close to people, by filling quiet with words, and by taking the next job that will pay for the next week.
