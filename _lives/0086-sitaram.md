# ethnicity: 'Indo-Aryan Hindu peasant/artisan (local Hindi dialect continuum: Malwi/Nimadi/Bundeli-related)'
# father_occupation: Cultivator (self-cultivating smallholder/tenant; main work is farming
#   family fields)
# historical_context:
# - event: Spillover instability from Mughal–Deccan conflict and early Maratha raiding/warfare,
#     increasing insecurity on roads/markets and occasional requisitions or disruptions
#     even in central India.
#   timing: Later adulthood, roughly ages 30–52 (1660–1683)
# - event: A serious monsoon failure or multi-season drought in central India causing
#     poor harvests, high grain prices, and increased indebtedness (a recurring pattern
#     in 17th-century agrarian life).
#   timing: At least once during ages 20–50 (1650–1680)
# - event: Recurring malaria/fever ecology in the Narmada valley (post-monsoon mosquito
#     seasons) affecting labor availability and household productivity, with periodic
#     'bad fever years'.
#   timing: Repeated seasonal impact across life; ages 5–52 (1635–1683)
# - event: Expansion of regional cash-crop and market ties (cotton/oilseeds, cattle,
#     forest products) via weekly haats and road networks, increasing both opportunities
#     and exposure to price swings and merchant credit.
#   timing: Most salient in adulthood, ages 20–52 (1650–1683)
# household_social_status: Ordinary cultivating household (smallholder or tenant; modest
#   but stable village standing)
# household_structure_at_birth: Married parents in a joint/extended patrilocal household
#   (father’s parents and/or father’s brothers with their wives/children co-resident
#   or sharing a compound)
# household_structure_at_death: 'Nuclear household: just he, his wife, and (if any)

#   grain processing; helps in fields at peak seasons)
# narrative_plan:
#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: 1666
#     name: Bhairav
#     narrative_role: Self-cultivating tenant/smallholder. Strict about work and obligations,
#       but not cruel; he expects Sitaram’s steadiness. Becomes frail in Sitaram’s early
#       30s and dies after several fever/weakness spells, making Sitaram feel he has
#       ‘done his duty’ yet also leaving financial strain.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: 1662
#     name: Lakshmi
#     narrative_role: Household manager and field helper; emotionally central and highly
#       ritual-practical (daily lamp, offerings, vows). Warm but anxious about reputation;
#       she presses Sitaram toward marriage. Widowed in the mid-1660s but dies slightly
#       earlier here (late-1650s/early-1660s) after recurring illness, shifting caregiving
#       burdens onto Sitaram and his wife.
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: 1644
#     name: Durgabai
#     narrative_role: Early childhood presence who tells village-deity stories and enforces
#       household routine; her death marks the first remembered funeral for young Sitaram
#       and contributes to his anxious fear of illness.
#     role: paternal grandmother (co-resident elder in joint household at Sitaram’s
#       birth)
#   children:
#   - birth_year: 1656
#     death_age: 20
#     death_year: 1676
#     name: Ramcharan
#     narrative_role: First child and early hope for the household; helps in the fields
#       as a teen. His death at 20 (likely fever/accident context) becomes a major grief
#       and increases Sitaram’s anxiety and sense of precariousness.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1659
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 1659
#     name: Sita
#     narrative_role: Infant death soon after birth; reinforces the couple’s ritual
#       observances and the mother’s fear of childbirth outcomes.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: 1662
#     death_age: 57
#     death_year: 1719
#     name: Govind
#     narrative_role: Surviving son who eventually establishes his own nearby household,
#       enabling the ‘nuclear at death’ arrangement. Relationship is dutiful; Sitaram
#       leans on him during the accident period and later takes pride in his steadiness.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1665
#     death_age: 55
#     death_year: 1720
#     name: Kamla
#     narrative_role: Surviving daughter; as she approaches marriageable age during
#       the debt crisis, her dowry/arrangements add pressure. Later she marries out
#       to a nearby village, remaining emotionally important but not co-resident.
#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 17
#     connection: Occurs during seasonal fair/extra work when adolescent Sitaram is
#       away from the tight scrutiny of his household; becomes a private memory that
#       both attracts and frightens him, feeding later anxiety about being 'found out.'
#     incident: premarital_sex
#   - age: 29
#     connection: Irrigation dispute during a tense growing season; reinforces his conflict-avoidant
#       style and preference for negotiated turns and elder mediation afterward.
#     incident: physical_assault
#   - age: 33
#     connection: Begins after mother’s decline; intensifies household responsibilities
#       just as his own children are young, stressing marriage and finances.
#     incident: elderly_parents
#   - age: 24
#     connection: Starts soon after marriage via contact at weekly haat/river ghat;
#       secrecy management becomes a recurring anxiety theme and influences his emotional
#       distance at home.
#     incident: extramarital_sex
#   - age: 35
#     connection: During caregiving years and rising costs, he cuts/sells timber to
#       cover shortages; ties into market expansion and the growing importance of cash
#       to meet dues.
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   - age: 39
#     connection: Triggered by monsoon failure and harvest loss; compounded by previous
#       caregiving depletion and loss of labor/cattle; pushes him into dependence on
#       a bania lender.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 41
#     connection: Happens during recovery attempt after debt crisis—working harder,
#       hauling more; injury forces reliance on surviving son Govind and kin, delaying
#       recovery.
#     incident: serious_accident
#   - age: 47
#     connection: After partial recovery and careful saving, he rebuilds assets; elders
#       trust his steady, honest demeanor to witness boundaries, aligning with his high
#       conscientiousness/honesty.
#     incident: major_achievement
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-7
#     key_events:
#     - '1630–1637: Multiple infant deaths in the household (two younger brothers, then
#       a toddler brother) shape an atmosphere of protective ritual and fear of fevers.'
#     - '1644 (age 14 is later; adjust here): Early remembered funeral is grandmother’s
#       death in 1644 when he is 13–14; before that, repeated post-monsoon fevers are
#       normal seasonal fear.'
#     - Learns farm routine early; quiet child who stays close to mother and avoids
#       boisterous groups of boys.
#     phase: Early childhood (joint household)
#   - age_range: 8-18
#     key_events:
#     - Begins regular fieldwork and cattle tending; learns irrigation turns and boundary
#       norms from father and elder brother.
#     - 'Develops noticeable social anxiety: avoids speaking in front of elders at the
#       haat and panics when singled out.'
#     - '1647–1648 (ages 17–18): brief premarital sexual encounter with another youth
#       during fair/seasonal work.'
#     phase: Later childhood and adolescence
#   - age_range: 19-31
#     key_events:
#     - '1654 (age 24): arranged marriage to Rukmini; establishment as a householder.'
#     - '1656–1665: births of four children (with one infant death), while he remains
#       a steady cultivator.'
#     - '1659 (age 29): physical assault over irrigation turn; becomes more cautious
#       and conflict-avoidant.'
#     phase: Young adulthood (marriage and early parenting)
#   - age_range: 32-44
#     key_events:
#     - '1662–1666 (ages 32–36): prolonged caregiving for frail parents; household labor
#       tightens and anxiety worsens.'
#     - '1664–1667 (approx.): greater insecurity on roads/markets as Deccan conflict
#       spillovers rise; village talk about raids/requisitions.'
#     - '1668–1670 (ages 38–40): severe debt crisis after poor monsoon and crop shortfall;
#       mortgages land, sells bullocks.'
#     phase: Midlife strain (care, debt, concealment)
#   - age_range: 45-52
#     key_events:
#     - '1671–1672 (ages 41–42): serious cart accident with long incapacity; son and
#       kin manage fields.'
#     - '1675–1680 (ages 45–50): gradual recovery of assets and reputation; gains a
#       strip of land, rebuilds cattle team, asked to witness boundaries.'
#     - '1683 (age 52): dies of respiratory infection after a bad season of cough/fever.'
#     phase: Later adulthood (recovery, local standing, decline)
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Kallu
#     prominence: Ages 24–46 (1654–1676), most prominent during ages 30–40 when secrecy
#       and anxiety are strongest.
#     relationship: Same-sex partner/acquaintance met at weekly haat and Narmada ghat;
#       intermittent, discreet encounters.
#   - name: Hiralal
#     prominence: Ages 38–45 (1668–1675), central during debt and early recovery.
#     relationship: Bania moneylender who provides grain advances and cash loans; holds
#       the mortgage during the crisis.
#   - name: Bansidhar
#     prominence: Age 29 (1659) and afterward as an ongoing source of tension in irrigation
#       turns.
#     relationship: Neighboring cultivator involved in irrigation scheduling; related
#       to the men who assault Sitaram.
#   - name: Vaid Narottam
#     prominence: Ages 32–36 and 41–42 (1662–1666; 1671–1672).
#     relationship: Village healer/vaid consulted during parents’ frailty and later
#       during Sitaram’s accident recovery.
#   - name: Pandit Shridhar
#     prominence: Intermittent across life; especially during infant deaths remembrance
#       and parents’ decline (ages 0–10; 32–36).
#     relationship: Local priest who officiates household rites and advises on vows/offerings
#       during illness years.
#   partners:
#   - name: Rukmini
#     narrative_role: Arranged marriage when Sitaram is ~24. Relationship is cooperative
#       and respectful rather than openly romantic; she relies on his reliability and
#       he relies on her competence. Periodic tension arises from his emotional distance
#       and anxiety, but they function as a working pair, especially during caregiving
#       and debt years.
#     relationship_end_year: 1683
#     relationship_start_year: 1654
#   siblings:
#   - birth_year: 1628
#     death_age: 57
#     death_year: 1685
#     name: Ramdas
#     narrative_role: Eldest surviving sibling and early model for farm work; protective
#       but sometimes critical. As the senior brother in the joint household, he is
#       both Sitaram’s shield in disputes and a source of pressure to conform (marriage,
#       reputation). Outlives Sitaram by two years.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1629
#     death_age: 2
#     death_year: 1631
#     name: Ganga
#     narrative_role: A faint family memory and recurring point of mourning in the household
#       (especially for the mother), shaping Sitaram’s early sense that children can
#       be lost quickly.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: 1630
#     death_age: 52
#     death_year: 1683
#     name: Sitaram
#     narrative_role: Protagonist; quiet, dutiful cultivator who slowly improves his
#       holding while managing anxiety and a hidden sexual life.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1632
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 1632
#     name: Kanhaiya
#     narrative_role: Stillbirth/neonatal death; referenced in women’s talk and in the
#       mother’s protective rituals.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1634
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 1634
#     name: Mohan
#     narrative_role: Another neonatal death that reinforces the household’s anxiety
#       around childbirth and reliance on household offerings and vows.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1636
#     death_age: 1
#     death_year: 1637
#     name: Shivram
#     narrative_role: Died as a toddler; remembered through small stories (a bracelet,
#       a lullaby). His death becomes part of why Sitaram later feels obligated to care
#       for aging parents—‘so much was already taken.’
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds trust with elders and enables gradual asset recovery; also
#       contributes to overwork before the cart accident.
#     scene: 'He keeps meticulous (non-written) routines: counting seed by measure,
#       repairing bunds before rains, and insisting cattle are watered even when sick
#       or tired; he is known for showing up early to irrigation turns.'
#     timing: Most visible ages 20–52, especially during debt recovery ages 45–50
#     trait: Conscientiousness (very high)
#   - consequence: Helps him adapt to market changes and later improve his holding;
#       also draws him into wider social spaces that trigger anxiety.
#     scene: He seeks out new crop-handling tips and listens closely to travelers at
#       the haat about prices/roads; he is curious about devotional songs and regional
#       stories, even if he is not literate.
#     timing: Adolescence through midlife, ages 15–40
#     trait: Openness (high)
#   - consequence: Reduces social support breadth and makes him vulnerable in disputes
#       (leading up to the irrigation assault), but also keeps him from risky public
#       conflicts.
#     scene: At village gatherings he stays at the edge, speaking softly and letting
#       his elder brother handle confrontations; he prefers solitary tasks like watching
#       cattle or repairing tools.
#     timing: All life phases, strongest ages 10–35
#     trait: Extraversion (low)
#   - consequence: Earns reputation that supports 'major achievement' (local trust);
#       downside is that he sometimes yields too much in negotiations, worsening debt
#       vulnerability.
#     scene: He avoids bragging, shares fodder in shortage when possible, and is reluctant
#       to accuse neighbors directly; when witnessing boundary agreements he emphasizes
#       fairness and calm wording.
#     timing: Adulthood, ages 25–50
#     trait: Agreeableness & Honesty-Humility (high)
#   - consequence: Limits his willingness to negotiate assertively with lenders/officials;
#       increases reliance on elder brother/elders and contributes to emotional distance
#       in marriage.
#     scene: He rehearses what to say before approaching the patwari/collector’s agents,
#       then freezes and lets others speak; after the irrigation assault he avoids crowded
#       arguments and experiences persistent worry about gossip and exposure.
#     timing: Emerges in adolescence (ages 12–18), peaks during ages 24–40 alongside
#       secrecy and debt
#     trait: Anxiety-spectrum disorder (social anxiety/subclinical-moderate)
# number_of_children: '4'
# number_of_siblings: '5'
# occupation: Cultivator/farmer (self-cultivating smallholder or tenant; primary livelihood
#   from farming)
# religion: 'Village/household Hindu practice: daily-ish home puja (lamp/incense/food),
#   offerings to family & village deities, seasonal festivals, life-cycle rites; occasional
#   temple/Narmada visits'

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During a bad lean season he repeatedly cut and carted timber from a nearby
#     reserved/landlord-controlled grove (and once took fallen branches from another
#     cultivator’s boundary trees) to sell as fuel in the weekly haat, knowing it was
#     not fully permitted.
#   reasoning: Everyday “gray-zone” offenses (poaching, cutting timber, minor tax evasion,
#     boundary encroachment, taking irrigation water) were common among peasants, though
#     not universal.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Recurring pattern, ages 34–37
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime
# - event: After a failed monsoon and crop shortfall, he fell into heavy debt to a bania
#     moneylender; he had to mortgage part of his holding and sell a pair of bullocks,
#     living for a time on millet gruel and advances against the next harvest.
#   reasoning: Pre-modern agrarian lives were highly exposed to drought, crop failure,
#     price spikes, and debt; even a slightly better-off smallholder could face a major
#     debt/asset-loss episode at least once.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Sustained period, ages 38–40
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: By steady saving and careful management, he acquired an extra strip of cultivable
#     land and rebuilt his cattle team; village elders began asking him to witness boundary
#     agreements and help settle minor field disputes.
#   reasoning: For an illiterate rural cultivator, the most realistic “achievement”
#     is modest local success (improving land/cattle, respected village role), which
#     happens sometimes but is not guaranteed.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Sustained improvement and local recognition, ages 45–50
#   type: major_achievement
# - event: A quarrel at the irrigation turn escalated when another cultivator and his
#     brother struck him with fists and a lathi; he was left bruised and limping for
#     days but recovered without losing his work season.
#   reasoning: Land/water disputes, caste/status conflict, and occasional banditry make
#     at least one non-domestic assault a plausible lifetime event for a rural man,
#     and it is the most common form of 'victim violence' for adult men.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Single event, age 29
#   type: physical_assault
# - event: While unloading a bullock cart at harvest time, the cart shifted and he was
#     pinned and badly twisted his leg/hip; he could not walk properly and was largely
#     housebound while kin managed the fields.
#   reasoning: Farming, animals, wells, carts, and tools create steady accident risk;
#     a weeks-long incapacity accident happens to a minority but is not rare over decades.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Single event with weeks-long incapacity, ages 41–42
#   type: serious_accident
# - event: He and his wife fed and bathed his widowed mother and a frail father through
#     repeated fever/weakness spells, arranging herbal remedies and a village vaid while
#     also ensuring their daily puja needs were met.
#   reasoning: Some parents died before becoming very old, but when they did survive,
#     sons were typically responsible; joint-household origins raise the chance he had
#     caregiving duties earlier in adulthood even if later nuclearized.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Sustained caregiving period, ages 32–36
#   type: elderly_parents
# - event: As a late-teen working around the village and seasonal fairs, he had a brief
#     consensual sexual encounter with another unmarried youth from a neighboring hamlet,
#     kept secret to avoid scandal.
#   reasoning: Premarital sex existed but was constrained by surveillance and arranged
#     marriage; for a socially anxious rural man it’s plausible but not dominant.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Single/brief episode, ages 17–18
#   type: premarital_sex
# - event: After marriage, he maintained intermittent discreet same-sex encounters with
#     an acquaintance met at the weekly market/river ghat, timing meetings around pilgrim
#     days and travel to avoid notice in the village.
#   reasoning: Given homosexual orientation and a likely socially compulsory heterosexual
#     marriage, discreet same-sex relations outside marriage are a fairly likely pathway
#     to the confirmed 'nonstandard sexual history.'
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Recurring pattern, ages 24–46
#   type: extramarital_sex
---

Sitaram was born on September 23, 1630 in a small settlement in the Narmada valley, in what is now Madhya Pradesh. Mughal officers claimed revenue from the countryside through village headmen and record-keepers, but daily authority sat closer: elders, caste councils, the men who controlled irrigation turns, and the landholders whose groves and grazing patches framed village boundaries. Sitaram’s family spoke the local Hindi dialect and kept a household form of Hindu practice. Each morning his mother, Lakshmi, set a clay lamp by the wall-niche shrine and placed a pinch of grain and a dab of ghee before the image and a small stone kept for the village deity; on festival days she added marigolds and a little sweetened milk.

He arrived as the third child in a house that already held his father Bhairav, his elder brother Ramdas, his older sister Ganga, and Bhairav’s mother Durgabai. The home was part of a joint compound, with relatives sharing tools, cattle care, and grain storage. Ganga died in 1631, before Sitaram formed clear memories of her, but her absence stayed present in how Lakshmi checked a child’s forehead after the rains and how she tightened the thread amulet at Sitaram’s neck. Two younger brothers, Kanhaiya and Mohan, were born and died in the same year each, and the last, Shivram, lived only a year. Funerals came quickly and quietly for infants. For Durgabai, who ran the women hard and kept a sharp eye on stored grain, a child’s death meant more offerings and more caution with water.

Sitaram grew into a small, wiry boy who moved in close to the adults. He took well to routine. In the cool season he carried cow-dung cakes to dry on the wall and learned to stack them so air could move through. When the first rains came, he walked the field edges with Bhairav, pressing down soft places in the bunds with his heel. Ramdas, two years older, treated him as a shadow that needed pushing. He made Sitaram bring the rope for the plough, fetch a lost peg, count out seed by the wooden measure. If Sitaram hesitated, Ramdas snapped at him. When Sitaram did it right, Ramdas gave a brief nod and moved on.

Durgabai died in 1644. Sitaram was old enough to remember the courtyard full of relatives, the smell of clarified butter and smoke, and the way the men spoke in lowered voices. His father took the body to the river with other men. Lakshmi’s offerings that week were spare: a lamp at dusk, water in a brass lota, a little rice set aside. After that funeral Sitaram began to flinch at coughs that lasted more than a day, and he watched the monsoon season with a careful, tense attention.

By his early teens he worked like an adult on many days. He drove bullocks to the field at dawn and liked the first quiet stretch before others arrived. He avoided speaking at the weekly haat unless he had to. When an elder asked him a question, his mind filled with possible wrong answers and his tongue slowed; he glanced at Ramdas to speak for him. It brought scolding at home—Bhairav wanted a son who could bargain and argue—but Sitaram still preferred tasks with clear steps: cutting fodder, cleaning the ploughshare, measuring grain into a basket.

At seventeen, in 1647, he went with a small group to a seasonal fair and stayed out late near the edge of the camp. There he met a youth from a neighboring hamlet, and they had a brief, secret sexual encounter behind a line of carts. The next morning Sitaram kept his eyes down and spoke little on the road back. For weeks he watched who looked at him in the village and wondered who knew. No one confronted him, but the fear stayed and shaped how he moved through crowds.

Marriage came in 1654. At twenty-four he married Rukmini, brought into his household with bangles and a small bundle of clothes. She learned Lakshmi’s shrine routine and added her own order to the kitchen space, keeping lentils in one earthen jar and oil in another. Sitaram treated her with steady courtesy. He rose before sunrise, washed at the well, and took a moment at the shrine while Rukmini lit the lamp. He did not tell jokes easily, but he liked hearing Ramdas tease others, and sometimes he smiled into his cup of thin buttermilk when a neighbor was mocked for boasting.

Their first child, Ramcharan, was born in 1656. The boy grew quickly, and Sitaram took him on short trips to the fields once he could walk without stumbling. A daughter, Sita, was born in 1659 and died the same day. Lakshmi burned incense and placed a small ball of cooked rice at the shrine, then went back to work. That year, at twenty-nine, Sitaram was beaten in a quarrel over irrigation. At the water turn a neighbor, Bansidhar, argued that Sitaram had taken more time than his share. Voices rose. Bansidhar and his brother struck Sitaram with fists and a lathi, leaving him bruised and limping. He did not go to the Mughal officials; instead Ramdas and a village elder forced an apology and a small payment in grain. After that Sitaram arrived early to water turns and carried himself with visible caution, letting others talk first.

Govind was born in 1662, and Kamla in 1665. The household shifted. Lakshmi’s strength failed early in the 1660s, and she died in 1662. Bhairav aged fast after her death, and by 1663 he needed help rising, bathing, and eating. Sitaram and Rukmini fed him soft rice and watered milk and called Vaid Narottam for herbs and advice. Rukmini warmed oil for massage, and Sitaram carried his father to a shaded place in the courtyard during the hottest weeks. At night Sitaram lay awake, counting what grain remained and listening for his father’s breath, then scolded himself for the panic and got up before dawn anyway. Bhairav died in 1666.

Caregiving years ate savings. Cash demands did not stop. Revenue payments and market prices pulled on the household, and talk spread of road trouble to the south as conflict in the Deccan pushed riders and soldiers through. In 1664, with Ramdas distracted by his own growing family, Sitaram began cutting timber from a grove claimed by a local landholder and guarded on paper more than in practice. He went at dawn with a small axe, loaded branches onto a cart, and sold the wood at the haat as fuel. Once he took fallen branches from a boundary tree in another cultivator's field. He repeated the cutting through 1667, stopping only when he heard that a guard had been beaten in another village for trying to enforce the grove’s claim.

In 1668 the monsoon failed badly. Grain thinned in the bins. Sitaram borrowed from Hiralal, a bania lender who sat in the market shade with weights and a ledger. Sitaram could not read what was written, so he listened to the spoken terms, asked Ramdas once for confirmation, then nodded and pressed his thumb to the paper. By 1669 he had mortgaged part of his holding and sold a pair of bullocks. Through 1670 the household ate millet gruel more often than wheat, and Rukmini stretched lentils with wild greens. Sitaram avoided Hiralal’s gaze at the haat and sent Govind, still a boy, to carry small loads to market so Sitaram would not have to speak.

During these same years he kept a private, risky life. In 1654, soon after his marriage, he had met Kallu at the market and sometimes at the river ghat on days when pilgrims came. Kallu understood the need for silence. They met in short, planned moments, and Sitaram watched the paths before and after. Each meeting tightened his fear of gossip, and the fear pushed him to act even more controlled at home. Rukmini complained once that he spoke to her like an elder to a child. He answered with chores done early and grain measured carefully, not with warmth.

Ramcharan died in 1676 at twenty. He had been a steady worker by then, strong enough to hold the plough handles straight. His death left Sitaram short of labor and short of patience with his own worry. Govind took on more. Kamla, nearing marriageable age, became another pressure point; Sitaram counted what he could offer without losing the field.

In 1671, at forty-one, Sitaram suffered a serious accident while unloading a bullock cart after harvest. The cart shifted and pinned him, twisting his leg and hip. He could not walk properly for weeks. Ramdas and Govind managed the fields, and Rukmini handled the household. Vaid Narottam set a simple splint and gave bitter herbs. Sitaram lay in the shade, listening to the work he could not do, and forced himself to recite short prayers to Ram and to the household deity rather than spiral into panic.

Recovery came slowly, then turned into a stretch of improvement. From 1675 onward Sitaram saved whenever he could, buying back strength in practical pieces: a better yoke, a calf, then another animal. He acquired an extra strip of land in 1678 when a neighbor needed quick cash. He showed up for boundary checks, stood quietly while others argued, and spoke only when asked, but when he did speak he kept his words plain and consistent. Elders began asking him to witness agreements and settle minor disputes, not because he enjoyed it, but because he did not exaggerate.

By 1680 Govind set up his own household nearby, close enough to share labor but separate enough to keep grain stores distinct. Sitaram and Rukmini lived in a smaller nuclear arrangement then, with Kamla visiting from her husband’s village after marriage.

A respiratory illness took Sitaram in August 1683. He coughed hard, produced phlegm, and could not keep strength through the day. Rukmini and Govind’s household brought warm water, herbs from the vaid, and clarified butter for small offerings at the shrine, but he died on August 20 at fifty-two. His body was carried to the Narmada and cremated on a wood pyre; his family offered water and sesame, and Rukmini placed a final lamp at the household niche that evening.
