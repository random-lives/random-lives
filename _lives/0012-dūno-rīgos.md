#   timing: recurring; any decade, but most impactful in mid-adulthood (ages 25–45)
# - event: Woodland and scrub resource pressure near settlements (fuelwood, charcoal,

#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-7
#     key_events:
#     - Raised primarily under mother and co-resident grandparent(s), with eldest brother
#       stepping into some adult male roles.
#     - 'Learns seasonal routines: herd watching near home, collecting fuelwood, watching
#       hearth rites and food offerings.'
#     - Early exposure to infant deaths in household (siblings) normalizes constant
#       vigilance about cold, hunger, and sickness.
#     phase: Early childhood (father absent; three-generation home)
#   - age_range: 8-17
#     key_events:
#     - Begins regular herding and field tasks; spends long hours alone or with one
#       sibling, suiting his low extraversion.
#     - 'Community obligations increase: night watch/stock protection as raids and competition
#       are feared in the region.'
#     - First frequent drinking at seasonal feasts; binge patterns begin to show (hangovers,
#       missed morning tasks).
#     phase: Later childhood and adolescence (work training; community watchfulness)
#   - age_range: 18-33
#     key_events:
#     - Marriage to Rīna and establishment of a nuclear household near kin; begins managing
#       his own fields and herds.
#     - 'Births of children: son (-931), daughter (-928), infant son who dies (-925).'
#     - Increasing use of fermented drink during stress periods; occasional conflicts
#       and apologies within kin group.
#     phase: Young adulthood (marriage; household establishment)
#   - age_range: 34-42
#     key_events:
#     - Severe economic crisis during poor rains/early frost; livestock losses; seed
#       grain shortage; temporary dependency on a better-off neighbor/kin.
#     - Negotiations over grazing rights and repayment obligations; eldest son pushed
#       into heavier labor.
#     - Death of younger brother (age 30 for that brother) and later sister’s illness/death;
#       grief fuels heavier episodic drinking.
#     phase: Midlife (economic shock; grief; dependence on kin)
#   - age_range: 43-53
#     key_events:
#     - Household regains modest stability but remains ordinary; ongoing woodland pressure
#       makes fuel and browse harder to obtain.
#     - Daughter dies at 18 (when he is ~36), leaving a lasting emotional scar; drinking

#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Occasionally improves household practices (better storage/repair
#       ideas), but also earns mild suspicion for 'odd' curiosity and distractibility
#       during communal tasks.
#     scene: He is fascinated by unusual stones, animal tracks, and distant places spoken
#       of at feasts; he experiments with new ways of stacking stones for field boundaries
#       and tries unfamiliar mixes of herbs/smoke for preserving meat.
#     timing: adolescence through adulthood (ages 12-40)
#     trait: Openness (98th percentile) - very high
#   - consequence: Fewer protective alliances and less help in crises unless brokered
#       by wife/eldest brother; alcohol becomes a social lubricant and coping tool.
#     scene: He prefers solitary herding routes and quiet tool-repair by the hearth;
#       at gatherings he stays at the edge, speaking little until drinking loosens him.
#     timing: childhood onward; most visible ages 10-53
#     trait: Extraversion (15th percentile) - very low
#   - consequence: Short-term material relief but long-term mistrust from certain neighbors;
#       wife and eldest brother occasionally have to smooth relations.
#     scene: During lean years he downplays how much seed grain remains and frames deals
#       to his advantage (e.g., exaggerating losses when negotiating grazing or repayment),
#       while still maintaining a polite, agreeable surface.
#     timing: most visible in midlife economic stress (ages 34-42)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (13th percentile) - very low
#   - consequence: Helps maintain ordinary stability despite shocks; enables him to
#       negotiate complex reciprocal obligations—sometimes in self-serving ways.
#     scene: He quickly estimates fodder needs and weather risk, reads animal health
#       signs early, and is good at remembering obligations and routes between pasture
#       and water.
#     timing: adolescence and adulthood (ages 15-53)
#     trait: Intelligence (80th percentile) - high
#   - consequence: Reduced reliability and increased accident risk; contributes to strained
#       kin relationships and makes the see-saw between stability and crisis sharper.
#     scene: He binge-drinks at seasonal feasts and after losses; returns home unsteady,
#       misses dawn tasks, and sometimes becomes verbally harsh before shame-driven
#       apologies and renewed promises.
#     timing: begins late adolescence (ages 15-20), worsens in midlife (ages 30-40),
#       persists to death
#     trait: Problematic alcohol use/addiction
# number_of_children: '3'
# number_of_siblings: '8'
# occupation: Smallholder mixed farmer-herder (cereals/legumes + sheep/goats/cattle;

# structured_incidents:
# - event: After a run of poor rains and an early frost, his grain stores ran low and

#     a young cow to a better-off neighbor/kin household in exchange for food and the
#     right to graze, leaving his family dependent for a time.
#   reasoning: Rainfed farming and livestock in an upland environment faced periodic
#     shocks (drought, disease in herds, conflict), and without formal insurance a bad
#     run could mean major loss of assets. Remaining 'about the same' as birth suggests
#     many avoided permanent ruin, but crisis episodes were still common.

In late summer of 958 BC, a boy was born in the uplands east of the great river valleys, where small hamlets clung to ridges and cleared pockets of soil among oak and scrub. His people spoke a Celtic tongue and lived by fields and herds, owing their safety to kin ties and watchfulness rather than any distant ruler. They traded little beyond the next ridge, but bronze and salt moved along the long chain of exchanges that ran toward the coasts.

They named him Dūno-rīgos. The name fit the place: stone walls, a defended height, and the habit of measuring every path by where it could be watched.

His father was gone before Dūno-rīgos could remember him. The household held together anyway because three generations lived under one roof. His mother, Nera, ran the work. Olda, her mother, sat closest to the hearth in winter and closest to the doorway in summer, where she could see the goats come in. Branos, the eldest son, took on the hard tasks early: carrying water skins, moving stones from the thin soil, keeping younger boys from wandering into gullies.

Dūno-rīgos grew up in a house that kept the hearth fed and the ancestors addressed. At the first light, Nera poured a small splash of drink onto the packed earth by the hearth and set a crust there when bread was cut. When the goats kidded, she spoke low over the afterbirth before burying it near the wall. Dūno-rīgos watched these acts closely. He asked questions that did not end. Why this corner, why that stone, why the smoke needed a certain plant mixed in when meat hung to dry. Olda answered some and brushed others aside. Branos told him to stop wasting words.

The family grew fast. Katuros arrived in 956 BC and followed Dūno-rīgos like a shadow. An infant brother in 954 BC lived only long enough to be wrapped and carried to the edge of the clearing. Another brother, born in 952 BC, survived and became strong before dying young later. Sena came in 950 BC, loud and sharp-eyed. A girl born in 948 BC died as quickly as the earlier infant. Windo was born in 946 BC and became the smallest child with the fastest feet. The last boy, born in 944 BC, lasted one winter.

When Dūno-rīgos was ten, rain failed in a way that did not end after a single season. The grain heads stayed thin. Pasture browned early. Nera cut thinner loaves. Branos began sleeping closer to the animals. The men of the hamlet started meeting at dusk on the higher ground, speaking in short phrases and watching the routes that led in from other valleys. Dūno-rīgos carried messages and learned which paths were taken by strangers.

He spent long days with goats on the edge of the scrub. He liked those hours. He found out where water held longest in shaded hollows. He noticed which plants made the goats sick and which soothed them. He built small stacks of stones to mark the safest slopes and then rearranged them until they pleased him. Katuros tried to talk to him the whole time, telling jokes he had heard from older boys, and Dūno-rīgos answered in clipped words. He kept his eyes on the herd.

At fifteen, he stood his first night watch with Branos. They stayed behind a low wall above the enclosure, listening for the small sounds that meant trouble: a goat shifting, a dog lifting its head, stones rolling where feet did not belong. Dūno-rīgos stayed quiet and alert. When men came back from a distant marriage feast and wanted company by the fire, he sat at the edge and let others speak. He drank with them. The drink made him louder than he ever was in daylight. It also made him careless. The next morning he walked late to the field, eyes red, tongue thick, and Branos set him to the heaviest task without a word.

In 933 BC, Dūno-rīgos took a wife from nearby kin. Her name was Rīna. She came with a basket of woven cloth and a small bronze pin, and she knew how to make a house run without asking anyone’s permission. Dūno-rīgos built up the low walls of their plot and widened the doorway of their house so loads could pass through. He did it with a careful eye for angles, adjusting stones again and again until the wall held without wobbling.

They had a son in 931 BC and named him Gaiso. Dūno-rīgos took the boy out early, setting him on a blanket in the shade while he repaired a yoke or sharpened a blade. He did not chatter at the child. He showed him things. How to judge a sheep’s limp. How to test the edge of a flint. How to listen for water under a thin crust of soil.

A daughter, Bela, was born in 928 BC. She grew quick and stubborn. She learned to spin early at Rīna’s knee and laughed loudest when Branos teased her about stealing curds. Dūno-rīgos watched his children with a tight, private pride. He also guarded his time from neighbors’ talk. Rīna handled most of the visits and exchanges, and she spoke for the household when Dūno-rīgos sat silent.

In 925 BC, another son was born and died the same day. Nera came and washed the infant while Olda prepared the hearth offering. Dūno-rīgos dug the small grave himself and tamped the earth down hard. That night he drank until he fell asleep sitting upright, head against the wall. Rīna did not argue with him. She kept the house steady and made him drink water the next morning before he went out.

Goat sickness came through the uplands more than once in those years. It moved from herd to herd, leaving thin animals that coughed and stopped eating. Dūno-rīgos was quick to separate the weak ones, to burn bedding, to move the herd to cleaner ground. He also learned the tricks of bargaining in tight times. He could talk gently while keeping the best of a deal for himself. When he traded a goat, he praised its strength and spoke lightly of its bad cough. He did it with a calm face. Rīna knew and said nothing when the meat came back to their house.

In 923 BC, his brother born in 952 BC died at thirty. The death came fast after a short illness. Dūno-rīgos helped carry the body and sat through the rites, jaw set. When the others spoke over food, he stayed silent until drink reached him, then he argued over small points and later apologized with gifts of cheese and dried meat. Branos accepted, but he also began sending Windo to check on Dūno-rīgos after feasts.

In 922 BC, the weather turned hard. The rains came wrong, then stopped. An early frost cut what stood in the fields. Dūno-rīgos opened the storage pit and saw the bottom too soon. Several goats died in the same week, stiff and thin. He and Rīna went to Aruos, a better-off kinsman with more cattle and a larger enclosure. Dūno-rīgos spoke smoothly and kept his eyes on Aruos’s hands. He offered part of his seed grain and a young cow as security. In return Aruos gave food and the right to graze on a sheltered slope. It saved Dūno-rīgos’s household, but it placed them under Aruos’s terms until repayment.

Gaiso was only nine, but he worked like a grown boy that year. He led goats out at dawn and came back after dusk with scratches on his legs from scrub. Bela carried water and gathered fuelwood farther from home than she ever had before, because the nearer stands had been stripped over the years. Rīna kept accounts in her head: what was owed, what was promised, what could be spared. Dūno-rīgos did the hardest work in bursts, then disappeared into drink when exhaustion and shame caught him. Once he returned late, stumbled, and dropped a basket of grain. Rīna slapped his hand away and scooped it up herself, fast, before chickens could reach it.

In 920 BC, they began paying Aruos back in measured gifts: a kid, a coil of good rope, a share of grain from the first better harvest. Dūno-rīgos chose the payments carefully, always holding something back. Branos confronted him once in front of the wall. Dūno-rīgos answered with soft words and a straight face. Branos turned away and let Rīna handle Aruos after that.

Sena fell sick in 913 BC and died in 912 BC, leaving children in another hamlet. Rīna traveled there with cloth and food. Dūno-rīgos stayed home and repaired a broken gate, working until his hands split, then drank alone by the hearth. When Rīna returned, he asked for details in short questions and listened without moving.

Bela died in 910 BC at eighteen, taken by a sudden fever after days of weakness. Dūno-rīgos built the bier and carried it with Gaiso and Katuros. After the rites he drank heavily and got into a fight with a cousin over a small insult. Branos pulled him off and shoved him into the dirt. Dūno-rīgos did not speak to Branos for a month. Then he brought him a cured hide and sat beside him without words.

By the time Dūno-rīgos reached fifty, the woodland edge had retreated from the nearest clearings. Fuelwood took longer. Grazing took more watching because herds pressed closer to each other. Windo, now grown, helped keep the animals moving and the fences mended. Dūno-rīgos stayed an ordinary smallholder, neither rich nor ruined. He kept his household together with Rīna’s steadiness and his own sharp eye for land and animals, and with bursts of charm that came when he needed something.

In the winter of 905 BC, Dūno-rīgos climbed onto a low stone wall to cut branches for fodder. The stones shifted under his foot. He fell and struck his head on a rock at the base of the wall. He did not stand again. He died on February 26, 905 BC, with Rīna and Gaiso in the house he had walled and repaired by hand.
