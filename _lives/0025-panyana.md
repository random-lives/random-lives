Panyana was born at the end of the dry season in 1699 in a farming settlement near Lafon, in the savanna hills north of the great swamps. No king’s courts reached the homesteads there. Authority sat with elder men in the patrilineage, and with the keepers of the land shrines who organized rain and harvest rites. Her family spoke a Central Sudanic tongue of the Moru–Madi cluster.

Her father, Ladu, had spent the previous weeks clearing and burning a new patch beyond the old fields. He slept in the men’s side of the compound with his brothers, sharing tools and grain stores. Her mother, Rika, worked with the other women at the mortar and in the plots close to the houses. Water came from a streambed that still held a few shaded pools.

Rika delivered in the family compound with female kin nearby. The cord was cut and tied. The women washed Panyana and rubbed her skin with oil. They kept her close, out of the wind, and tried to settle her at the breast.

By night she grew hot and fretful. Rika’s sister warmed water and rinsed cloths. An older woman pressed herbal paste near the navel and spoke the short words used at the land shrine when sickness came into a house. Before the next sunrise, the newborn’s body stiffened and her jaw set. Rika laid her down on a mat and stopped trying to feed her.
