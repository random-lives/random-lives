# ethnicity: Oromo-speaking (Shewa Oromo; gadaa-based confederations, locally varying
#   religion)
# father_occupation: Primarily crop farmer (more settled cultivation, limited herding)
# historical_context:
# - event: 'Oromo expansion and consolidation in Shewa: shifting clan territories, tribute
#     relationships, and periodic conflict with Christian highland forces and neighboring
#     groups, affecting security and land access.'
#   timing: childhood through adulthood (1630s–1680s)
# - event: Imperial-era instability and changing military pressures under the Gondarine
#     emperors (including campaigns and demands on frontier regions), intermittently
#     increasing requisitions, forced contributions, or security concerns even in rural
#     areas.
#   timing: intermittent across adulthood, especially 1650s–1670s
# - event: Localized raiding/feuding cycles typical of frontier zones (cattle raids,
#     reprisals, and temporary insecurity), disrupting market attendance, herding patterns,
#     and field guarding requirements.
#   timing: sporadic, most likely teens through 40s (1640s–1670s)
# - event: Rainfall variability in the Shewa highlands causing at least one notable
#     poor-harvest period (drought/late rains) with higher grain prices and increased
#     hunger risk for subsistence farmers.
#   timing: at least once during adulthood (1650s–1670s)
# - event: Expansion of long-distance trade and market integration around the Gondarine
#     era (increased circulation of salt, coffee, textiles, and slaves), making periodic
#     markets more important and exposing rural households to price swings and new goods.
#   timing: gradually increasing during adulthood (1650s–1680s)
# household_social_status: Ordinary commoner household (typical cultivator/herder; modest
#   assets; no special rank)

#   reasoning: As a non-elite, non-literate, locally rooted subsistence farmer, most
#     life outcomes would be ordinary; personality could bring small local influence,

#   tier: 1
#   timing: late 30s to early 40s (c. 1670–1674)
#   type: major_achievement
# - event: As an unmarried young man, he had a consensual sexual relationship with a
#     girl from a nearby homestead during seasonal work gatherings, which became known
#     and led to a tense exchange of compensation and mediation between families.
#   reasoning: In many rural agrarian societies, some premarital sexual activity occurs
#     despite norms favoring marital sex; as a highly extraverted man with very low
#     conscientiousness, he would be more likely than average to take such risks before
#     settling into marriage.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late teens to early 20s (c. 1649–1652)
#   type: premarital_sex
# - event: While attending a periodic market day and communal beer-drinking gathering,
#     he began an affair with a married woman from another neighborhood; when rumors
#     spread, elders intervened and he had to provide livestock/goods as settlement
#     to end the liaison.
#   reasoning: He was married monogamously at death, but extramarital encounters can
#     still occur; his low honesty-humility and low conscientiousness increase likelihood,
#     though strong kin/community sanctions and logistical constraints in small rural
#     communities keep the rate below premarital sex.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: mid-30s (c. 1665–1668)

Lataa was born on August 28, 1631, in the wooded highlands of Shewa, in a rural Oromo community where authority came from elders and local leaders, and where the distant Christian court at Gondar mattered mainly when armed men or tax demands reached the frontier. His family compound stood on sloping land above small fields cut into the hillside. The household was extended and patrilocal. His grandfather Gurmeessaa sat close to the gate most mornings, watching who came and went, and his father Mammoo measured the seasons by the feel of the soil in his hands.

Lataa grew up hearing Oromo speech only. Daily life followed the farm. Before sunrise his mother Biqilaa lit the cooking fire and set out porridge. She kept her work close to the house, grinding grain, watching small children, and tending the stores. Lataa learned to carry water, to sweep the yard clean of husks, to keep birds from the drying grain. When he was small, he slept with other children on a hide spread near the hearth. When Gurmeessaa spoke, Lataa listened, because the old man decided quarrels over goats and boundary stones, and he expected obedience.

The compound carried grief early. In 1633 Biqilaa bore a daughter who died in the same year. In 1636 a son was born and died before he could be carried far from the house. Biqilaa washed the infants and wailed with the women, and Mammoo slaughtered a small animal for a household rite to Waaqa. Lataa remembered the smell of smoke and blood in the yard and the way his grandfather spoke in a low voice when strangers were present. In 1639 a sister lived, Caaltuu, and the household kept her close. In 1642 another son was born, and for a time Lataa carried the boy on his hip and made faces to stop his crying. The boy died in 1645 at age three, after a short sickness that left him limp and hot. After that, Biqilaa pressed her palm to Lataa’s forehead when he coughed, and she did not let him sleep outdoors when nights turned cold.

By the time he reached ten, Lataa worked full days. Mammoo’s fields produced grain for the household and a small surplus for market. Lataa drove a stick into the soil to open holes for seed. He weeded on his knees until his hands cramped. When the grain headed, he spent long hours on a field edge with a sling and stones, snapping them toward birds. He liked the quiet of those watches, and he liked roasted grain taken from the fire and eaten with salt. Gurmeessaa took him to see elders when disputes were settled. Men spoke sharply and then sat to drink and accept a decision. Lataa listened and learned who held grudges.

Raiding and feuding touched the area through his teens. Men came back with stories of cattle taken and returned, of night alarms, of short skirmishes near paths. When Lataa traveled to a periodic market with Mammoo, they carried little and moved in a group, keeping to open ground. The market brought news as well as goods: salt slabs, cloth, iron, and coffee moving from one hand to another. Traders told of caravans and new demands from local leaders tied to the imperial world beyond Shewa. Once, in the 1640s, Mammoo helped guard the grain stores at night after rumors of a raid. Lataa was allowed to sit with the men and hold a spear longer than his arm. He watched the dark tree line and tried to stay awake.

In 1650, when Lataa was nineteen, he joined a seasonal work party at a nearby homestead for threshing and hauling. The days were loud with shouting and joking, and at night young people lingered while beer was passed. He began sleeping with a girl there, privately and by consent. Her kin found out. Talk moved fast across a few hills. The girl’s father demanded satisfaction and threatened violence. Obbo Jaaloo, an elder with a firm voice and a talent for ending disputes, called both families to sit. Lataa came with his father and grandfather. He answered questions bluntly and made matters worse before the elder cut him off. The settlement ended with Lataa’s family handing over goods as compensation, and the matter closed in public, though people kept their own opinions.

That episode pushed Mammoo to insist on a proper marriage. In 1654 Lataa married Hirpha from a neighboring community. The marriage formed a new conjugal household close to his kin, with a separate hut and its own grain store. Hirpha worked steadily and kept careful track of what remained in the pots and baskets. Lataa did not match her pace. He left tools where he used them, came late to morning tasks, and talked too long with friends when work waited. He liked gathering under a tree with Dachaasa and other men after field work, listening to gossip from the market and laughing at coarse jokes. He enjoyed beer more than he admitted to his wife.

In 1658 Hirpha bore a daughter. The infant died the same year, before she grew strong. Hirpha kept the child’s cloth close for days. Lataa avoided the house and lingered at the fields. When he returned, he expected food and quiet. Hirpha gave him both, but her face stayed tight when he spoke carelessly. With no child to bind them to a larger household of their own, they leaned on exchange labor with relatives. When older kin needed help, they went.

In 1664 Caaltuu died at age twenty-five. She had married out and lived within walking distance, and Lataa helped carry grain and water during her illness. After her death, obligations fell on surviving kin: visits, small gifts, and work for the household she left behind. Lataa met those duties because elders watched, and because Gurmeessaa demanded it.

In 1666, at age thirty-five, Lataa’s impatience with routine and his taste for attention led to trouble again. At a market day gathering, after beer had been passed through several hands, he began an affair with Sadaaq, a married woman from another neighborhood. They met away from the main paths and thought the matter would stay hidden. It did not. Rumors reached her husband’s kin, and threats followed. Obbo Jaaloo intervened again, angry that Lataa forced elders to spend time on preventable disputes. The settlement required Lataa to provide goods to end the liaison. He brought the payment with clenched jaw, and for months afterward Hirpha spoke to him in short sentences and kept her own counsel.

In 1671 the rains came poorly, late and uneven. Hillsides shed water in sudden bursts and cut channels through fields. Seed sprouted thin. Grain prices rose at the market, and talk of hunger spread. Lataa reacted differently than people expected after his scandal. He called neighbors to the eroded terrace line above their fields. He put men into groups, set a schedule, and kept them working until the stones held. He organized staggered planting so not all fields ripened at once, and he arranged night watches to guard the grain when it finally stood. He walked the edges at dusk with Dachaasa, checking where boys slept in the field huts and where stones for slings were stored. When the harvest came, it was smaller than in good years but not ruined. Elders praised him in public, and Obbo Jaaloo said his name without contempt.

The 1670s brought more trade through markets and more talk of distant power. Men spoke of imperial pressures and armed movements on the frontier. Lataa stayed in his local area. He farmed the same slopes, argued over the same boundaries, and attended the same gatherings. He never learned to read or write. He counted measures of grain by eye and memory, and he could recall who owed him labor from past exchanges. He enjoyed sitting on a low stool outside his hut in the late afternoon, chewing roasted grain and teasing Dachaasa about the size of his oxen.

In early 1682 Lataa developed a hard cough. It deepened into chest pain and short breath that left him stopping on small rises. Hirpha brewed hot infusions and kept the fire burning, but the illness held. On May 29, 1682, in his hut near Dano in Shewa, Lataa died at age fifty, with Hirpha beside him and the sound of wind in the trees outside.
