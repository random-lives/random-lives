# father_occupation: Primarily crop farmer (more settled cultivation, limited herding)
# historical_context:
# - event: 'Oromo expansion and consolidation in Shewa: shifting clan territories, tribute
#     relationships, and periodic conflict with Christian highland forces and neighboring
#     groups, affecting security and land access.'
#   timing: childhood through adulthood (1630s–1680s)
# - event: Imperial-era instability and changing military pressures under the Gondarine
#     emperors (including campaigns and demands on frontier regions), intermittently
#     increasing requisitions, forced contributions, or security concerns even in rural
#     areas.
#   timing: intermittent across adulthood, especially 1650s–1670s
# - event: Localized raiding/feuding cycles typical of frontier zones (cattle raids,
#     reprisals, and temporary insecurity), disrupting market attendance, herding patterns,
#     and field guarding requirements.
#   timing: sporadic, most likely teens through 40s (1640s–1670s)
# - event: Rainfall variability in the Shewa highlands causing at least one notable
#     poor-harvest period (drought/late rains) with higher grain prices and increased
#     hunger risk for subsistence farmers.
#   timing: at least once during adulthood (1650s–1670s)
# - event: Expansion of long-distance trade and market integration around the Gondarine
#     era (increased circulation of salt, coffee, textiles, and slaves), making periodic

# - event: During a year of poor rains, he organized neighboring households to repair
#     an eroded field-terrace and coordinate staggered planting and guarding of the
#     ripening grain, preventing major losses and earning public praise from local elders.
#   reasoning: As a non-elite, non-literate, locally rooted subsistence farmer, most
#     life outcomes would be ordinary; personality could bring small local influence,

# - event: As an unmarried young man, he had a consensual sexual relationship with a
#     girl from a nearby homestead during seasonal work gatherings, which became known
#     and led to a tense exchange of compensation and mediation between families.
#   reasoning: In many rural agrarian societies, some premarital sexual activity occurs
#     despite norms favoring marital sex; as a highly extraverted man with very low
#     conscientiousness, he would be more likely than average to take such risks before
#     settling into marriage.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late teens to early 20s (c. 1649–1652)
#   type: premarital_sex
# - event: While attending a periodic market day and communal beer-drinking gathering,
#     he began an affair with a married woman from another neighborhood; when rumors
#     spread, elders intervened and he had to provide livestock/goods as settlement
#     to end the liaison.
#   reasoning: He was married monogamously at death, but extramarital encounters can
#     still occur; his low honesty-humility and low conscientiousness increase likelihood,
#     though strong kin/community sanctions and logistical constraints in small rural
#     communities keep the rate below premarital sex.

Lataa was born on August 28, 1631, in the high country west of Shewa, where Oromo-speaking communities lived by grain fields and small herds and measured power through elders, assemblies, and ties of kin. The imperial court far to the north in Gondar sent armies and demanded tribute when it could, and Shewa sat in the middle of shifting control, new settlements, and feud.

He entered an extended homestead. His father, Boru, held the plow rights to several strips of rainfed land and kept only a few cattle, enough to lend an ox for a day but not enough to spare one. His mother, Sartu, stayed close to the compound with infants and grinding stones, taking field work only when hands were short. Lataa’s earliest memory was the sound of grain being pounded and the smell of damp earth after the first rains. He slept in a hut with other children while the older men talked late beside the fire and argued over boundary stones and marriage payments.

He grew up as the oldest of five. His next sister died before she learned to sit up, and the family buried her near the edge of the fields, where a thorn fence kept animals off the small mound. A brother came after her and lived. Another sister lived long enough to carry water and help with grinding, and then she died at twenty-five. The youngest brother died at three, after a fast sickness that left him quiet and limp. Those deaths narrowed the household. The living gathered closer; the adults watched children’s coughs and fevers and counted sacks of grain more carefully.

From early boyhood Lataa pushed himself into men’s talk. He hovered near visitors and repeated their words later, reshaping them into sharper stories. He learned fast when something interested him. When it did not, he left it half done. His father tried to keep him beside the fields at weeding time and in the threshing circle, but Lataa drifted toward gatherings: an age-set meeting, a cattle dispute, a beer-drinking at a neighbor’s house. He liked the heat of a crowd and the fast exchange of insult and laughter. He teased his cousin Biftu until Biftu threw chaff at him and chased him between the huts.

Raiding and feuding touched the area more than once in Lataa’s youth. Herds went missing at night. Men slept with spears close and moved cattle into tighter enclosures. Travelers kept to the larger paths and went in groups to market. When word came that armed men had been seen on a ridge, work stopped and watchers climbed to high points. Lataa ran with them and stared hard into the distance, trying to pick out movement among trees. He carried messages for elders because he could talk fast and remember what had been said.

As a teenager he took part in seasonal work gatherings where people from nearby homesteads cut and bundled grain together. In those crowded days he began a relationship with a girl named Nani. They met behind stacked stalks and again near a spring after sunset. They were careful until someone saw them slipping away. Nani’s family confronted his father. Boru’s voice stayed steady, but his hands shook when he counted out the compensation. Elders sat and made both families speak in turn. Lataa listened with a straight face and then argued back outside the meeting, louder than he should have, until his uncle dragged him aside and told him to stop talking. The settlement held. Nani married elsewhere.

In his twenties Lataa took a wife, Gammachi, from a nearby neighborhood. The marriage brought him into a new set of in-laws and obligations. He built a separate hut within the larger compound, close enough that older kin still walked through at will. He enjoyed the days when relatives gathered for coffee and roasted grain, and he liked being the one to fill cups and start jokes. He also left tasks unfinished and then tried to talk his way out of blame. When a fence sagged and goats broke into a patch of young plants, he talked loudly about the neighbor’s animals and the poor condition of the wood, and his father silently rebuilt the fence with him.

Markets grew busier during his adulthood. Salt bars came through in packs. Cloth from distant places appeared more often. People spoke of coffee moving in larger quantities and of slaves taken in wars and sold onward. Lataa went to periodic markets when he could. He liked the bargaining, the noise, the small dramas at each stall. He carried grain or honey beer to exchange and returned with metal points, a length of cloth for Gammachi, or a packet of salt. He also returned with rumors: a new conflict to the north, a movement of soldiers, the name of a man who had become powerful.

In his mid-thirties he began an affair with a married woman named Haro, from another neighborhood. It started at a market day and continued at beer gatherings. Lataa was careless with his words and generous with drink. People noticed. Rumors reached Haro’s husband, and then elders called Lataa in. They did not shout. They spoke slowly, weighing each sentence, and made him answer in front of men he needed for field labor and for protection. Lataa argued and tried to make it sound like talk had become accusation. The elders cut through him and named the settlement. He paid goods—grain and a young animal—and he ended the liaison. He kept going to markets, but he avoided Haro’s neighborhood and chose a different path when he saw her husband.

Gammachi gave birth once, a daughter, Daya. The child lived only a short time. Gammachi wrapped her tightly and sat apart, and Lataa moved restlessly between hut and yard, snapping at anyone who tried to speak softly to him. After the burial, he and Gammachi remained together, two people in one compound, without a child’s noise to structure the day. Their household stayed small even when they later lived alone, apart from the larger kin compound.

In his late thirties the rains failed. The first showers came late and then stopped. Seed sat in dry soil. Men walked the fields and pressed clods in their hands, then watched the sky. Grain prices climbed at market. Quarrels sharpened because everyone saw loss ahead. An old terrace above several fields began to break where runoff cut into it. Lataa walked up and down the slope, tracing the line of damage, then went house to house and insisted on a joint repair. He did not ask once; he returned and argued, and then he laughed and shamed men who tried to delay. He set teams for hauling stones and for digging, and he arranged a watch on the ripening grain once the rains returned in uneven bursts. He placed younger men at the edges at night and paired them so one could doze while the other listened. The terrace held through the next storms, and the planted strips below produced enough to keep people from stripping seed grain. Elders praised him in public at a gathering, naming his effort and the order he had imposed.

After that year he carried himself differently in meetings. He talked first. He offered plans. He still avoided long, patient routines. He left stacks of tools where others had to step around them. He forgot promised visits. He missed days of weeding and then arrived loud and energetic as if his presence erased the delay. Some men enjoyed him; others stayed wary and counted their goats after he left.

By 1682 his household was just Lataa and Gammachi in their own hut and yard. Early in the rainy season he developed a hard cough. It worsened over days and then weeks. He kept going out at first, insisting on walking to the edge of the fields, but he stopped to catch breath and leaned on his staff. He began sleeping upright against rolled hides. Gammachi heated water and brought him thick porridge, and he waved it away, then asked for it again later.

On May 29, 1682, the cough turned wet and relentless. He could not rise from his bedding. Gammachi sent word to nearby kin, and an elder came and spoke to him quietly. Lataa died that day in his hut, with the smell of damp earth coming in through the doorway and the sound of people moving in the yard.
