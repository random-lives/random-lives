# father_occupation: Primarily crop farmer (more settled cultivation, limited herding)
# historical_context:
# - event: 'Oromo expansion and consolidation in Shewa: shifting clan territories, tribute
#     relationships, and periodic conflict with Christian highland forces and neighboring
#     groups, affecting security and land access.'
#   timing: childhood through adulthood (1630s–1680s)
# - event: Imperial-era instability and changing military pressures under the Gondarine
#     emperors (including campaigns and demands on frontier regions), intermittently
#     increasing requisitions, forced contributions, or security concerns even in rural
#     areas.
#   timing: intermittent across adulthood, especially 1650s–1670s
# - event: Localized raiding/feuding cycles typical of frontier zones (cattle raids,
#     reprisals, and temporary insecurity), disrupting market attendance, herding patterns,
#     and field guarding requirements.
#   timing: sporadic, most likely teens through 40s (1640s–1670s)
# - event: Rainfall variability in the Shewa highlands causing at least one notable
#     poor-harvest period (drought/late rains) with higher grain prices and increased
#     hunger risk for subsistence farmers.
#   timing: at least once during adulthood (1650s–1670s)
# - event: Expansion of long-distance trade and market integration around the Gondarine
#     era (increased circulation of salt, coffee, textiles, and slaves), making periodic

# - event: During a year of poor rains, he organized neighboring households to repair
#     an eroded field-terrace and coordinate staggered planting and guarding of the
#     ripening grain, preventing major losses and earning public praise from local elders.
#   reasoning: As a non-elite, non-literate, locally rooted subsistence farmer, most
#     life outcomes would be ordinary; personality could bring small local influence,

# - event: As an unmarried young man, he had a consensual sexual relationship with a
#     girl from a nearby homestead during seasonal work gatherings, which became known
#     and led to a tense exchange of compensation and mediation between families.
#   reasoning: In many rural agrarian societies, some premarital sexual activity occurs
#     despite norms favoring marital sex; as a highly extraverted man with very low
#     conscientiousness, he would be more likely than average to take such risks before
#     settling into marriage.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late teens to early 20s (c. 1649–1652)
#   type: premarital_sex
# - event: While attending a periodic market day and communal beer-drinking gathering,
#     he began an affair with a married woman from another neighborhood; when rumors
#     spread, elders intervened and he had to provide livestock/goods as settlement
#     to end the liaison.
#   reasoning: He was married monogamously at death, but extramarital encounters can
#     still occur; his low honesty-humility and low conscientiousness increase likelihood,
#     though strong kin/community sanctions and logistical constraints in small rural
#     communities keep the rate below premarital sex.

Lataa was born in the highlands west of Shewa in 1631, in a time when Oromo-speaking groups were consolidating their hold over the region while Christian imperial armies from the north still pushed and negotiated along the frontiers. His family lived in a compound with his father, his mother, and older kin on his father’s side. The adults spoke Oromo and kept their rituals to Waaqa close to the homestead: blessings before plowing, oaths spoken aloud, offerings at places the elders treated with care.

His father, Jaldeessaa, worked fields more than he followed cattle. He watched the sky and the soil. He kept oxen for plowing but did not measure his standing in a large herd. When Lataa was small, he slept with other children close to the cooking fire and woke to the sound of grinding stones and the slap of dough on the flat pan. His mother, Roobaa, stayed near the home when her children were very young. She brewed beer for work parties and stored grain in clay-lined bins, and she kept track of who had given what to whom.

Lataa was the first child. After him came four siblings. Two died at birth. A sister, Qananii, lived into adulthood and died at twenty-five. A younger brother, Kumsaa, died at three. Those deaths did not change the work of the household. They changed the way his mother and the older women spoke over the fire. They repeated blessings more often. They watched the smallest children closely and argued about what food or herb should be given when a baby cried through the night.

As Lataa grew, Shewa’s frontier politics pressed into daily routines. A rumor of a raid could clear a path in the middle of the day. A messenger arriving at a homestead could mean a demand for grain, or a request for young men to stand watch, or a warning that a group from another neighborhood had taken livestock. Lataa liked the talking that followed such news. He stood close when elders argued and turned disputes into plans. He also cut corners in the work he was supposed to do. When his father sent him to weed, he wandered to the shade where other young men joked and challenged one another, then returned late with a handful of pulled plants and an excuse.

By his late teens he was part of the seasonal work gatherings where neighbors brought labor to one another’s fields. People drank beer and ate thick porridge between rounds of work. One season, Lataa began sleeping with a girl from a nearby homestead, Baqqalaa. It was not forced and it was not hidden well. Someone spoke about it in the wrong place. Her father confronted Jaldeessaa. The two families met with elders to avoid a feud that would spill into other households. There was shouting. Lataa talked back when he should have kept quiet. In the end, his father provided compensation—goods and a small animal—and the elders bound the matter with an agreement. Baqqalaa’s family kept her home more closely after that, and Lataa was sent out early in the mornings to work where the fields were farther from her path.

In his twenties, Lataa took on more of the plowing. His father’s back stiffened and the older men in the compound did less heavy work. Lataa brought energy when others dragged. He also took risks that created extra tasks for everyone. He traded grain too quickly after harvest for a piece of cloth and then had to borrow from kin before the next harvest. He promised to help a neighbor repair a roof and forgot until the neighbor stood in the yard and demanded an answer.

Markets became more important as trade grew around the Gondarine era. Salt bars moved along routes. Coffee traveled in small lots. Cloth, beads, and iron tools circulated more widely. Lataa went to periodic market days with grain or a bundle of produce. He liked the noise and the bargaining. He carried news back and forth, repeating what he had heard about fighting farther north, about demands from leaders, about the way prices shifted after a bad season.

In his late twenties he married a woman from a nearby neighborhood, Fayyisaa. The bridewealth was not lavish, but it was proper. Their conjugal household stood on its own within the larger neighborhood, close enough to share watch duties and work parties, far enough to keep their own stores. Fayyisaa managed the home and kept the beer and grain moving through the year. Lataa worked the fields and argued with other men about boundaries, about whose ox had strayed, about who had not shown up when called.

Raiding and feuding did not stop. It came in bursts. Some years were quiet and the watchmen slept. Other years men guarded fields at night to keep thieves from cutting grain and carrying it away in bundles. When a dispute threatened to pull in multiple households, elders called meetings and forced settlements before violence spread. Lataa talked loudly in those gatherings. He also insulted people when he wanted to press an advantage, then expected the same people to help him on his land the next week.

In his mid-thirties, at a market day that ended in heavy drinking, he began an affair with a married woman, Galaanaa, from another neighborhood. They met away from the main paths. It did not stay quiet. A sister-in-law saw them together and spoke. Rumors ran ahead of them. Elders intervened before the husband and his kin retaliated. Lataa was summoned and questioned in front of men who had little patience for excuses. He tried to laugh it off at first. That made it worse. The settlement required him to provide goods—livestock and grain—to end the liaison. He paid. He returned home and faced his wife’s anger inside the compound, where there was no crowd to impress and no room to argue his way out.

When rains failed during one stretch in the early 1670s, hunger threatened quickly. The soil dried and cracked. Seed went into ground that did not close around it. Grain prices rose at the markets. People watched one another’s stores. Some talked about moving, but most stayed and tightened their belts. An older field-terrace above several homesteads began to erode, sending water and soil down in a rush during the first weak storms. Lataa did not wait for someone else to call a meeting. He went household to household and pulled men into a work party. He argued with those who resisted and flattered those who agreed. They rebuilt the terrace with stones and packed earth. He arranged guard rotations for the ripening grain and pushed a plan for staggered planting in the parts of the valley where moisture held. That season still brought losses, but the fields under that terrace kept enough soil and water to produce. Elders spoke his name in public and tied the success to the work he had driven.

Fayyisaa became pregnant once. Their daughter was born and died at birth. After that, no child survived in their household. They remained together. They worked. They attended rituals and neighborhood meetings. They gave and received labor in the cycles of planting and harvest. Lataa kept talking too much and promising too much, and then doing a burst of hard work when he felt pressed. He stayed an ordinary man, with a plot that fed him and a name that carried weight only as far as his neighbors could hear it.

In 1682, near the end of the dry season, he caught a hard respiratory illness. He coughed until his chest hurt and could not keep up with even small chores. Fayyisaa heated water and kept him near the fire. Neighbors brought small amounts of food and checked in at the doorway. After days of coughing and breathlessness, he died in the house, fifty years old.
