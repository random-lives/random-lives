# ethnicity: Andhra (Telugu-speaking; Vengi/Andhra desa local rural population)
# father_occupation: Cultivator + seasonal agricultural wage labor (supplementing small/uncertain

# historical_context:
# - event: Revenue extraction and labor obligations under the Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi
#     (assessment of crops, collection visits, occasional corvée for irrigation works/roads/temple
#     lands) shaping household workload and grain reserves.
#   timing: childhood through adulthood (c. 680s–720s)
# - event: Localized political instability and raiding during Deccan power contests
#     (Vengi–Badami Chalukya–Pallava frontier politics), leading to occasional troop
#     movement, requisitioning, or insecurity in the countryside even without a major
#     campaign at her village.
#   timing: intermittent; especially adulthood (c. 690s–720s)
# - event: Monsoon rainfall variability producing at least one poor-harvest year (late
#     rains/early cessation) with higher grain prices and increased dependence on loans
#     and wage work for cultivators.
#   timing: at least once during adulthood (c. 700–721)
# - event: Endemic malaria and recurring 'fever seasons' tied to standing water after

#       after widowhood.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Frequent scolding and mistrust from sisters-in-law; she is assigned
#       less prestigious tasks and watched more closely, worsening her depression.
#     scene: She repeatedly misses agreed timings—arrives late to transplanting/harvest,
#       forgets to soak grain or tends the cooking fire poorly, and leaves tasks half-finished,
#       forcing other women to cover.
#     timing: visible from childhood; peaks in married years (ages 18-30) and again
#       during the debt years (33-36) when demands are higher
#     trait: Very low conscientiousness (1st percentile)
#   - consequence: Fewer allies outside immediate kin; rumors and blame stick more easily
#       because she does not defend herself socially.
#     scene: Avoids courtyard gatherings and festival crowds; speaks little in councils
#       of women, letting others negotiate while she stays on the edge, eyes down, doing
#       repetitive work.
#     timing: adolescence onward (ages 12+), especially after infant losses
#     trait: Very low extraversion (3rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Escalates household conflict; reduces willingness of others to accommodate
#       her during depressive episodes.
#     scene: When accused of laziness or ritual mistakes, she snaps sharply—short, cutting
#       replies rather than appeasing; occasional shouting matches with Subbamma over
#       grain portions during the debt period.
#     timing: married adult life and widowhood (ages 20-40)
#     trait: Low agreeableness (16th percentile)
#   - consequence: Sleep disturbance and somatic complaints; increased reliance on ritual
#       remedies and elders’ approval.
#     scene: Persistent worry about omens, infant illness, and household scarcity; catastrophizes
#       during fever seasons and monsoon delays, seeking repeated reassurance through
#       vows and checking stores.
#     timing: adolescence through widowhood (ages 14-42), intensifying during 712-715
#       crisis
#     trait: Moderately high neuroticism (62nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Erodes trust with sisters-in-law; strengthens the narrative that
#       she is unreliable and self-serving.
#     scene: During scarcity she hides small amounts of tamarind or dried grain for
#       herself, and downplays it when confronted, framing it as 'for later' or 'for
#       offerings.'
#     timing: primarily during the severe economic crisis (ages 33-36)
#     trait: Low honesty-humility (20th percentile)
#   - consequence: Occasional small conflicts with ritual gatekeepers; also makes her
#       memorable and somewhat 'different' in the village.
#     scene: Shows unusual interest in songs and stories from travelers and temple festivals;
#       experiments with nonstandard offerings/fasts she hears about and asks questions
#       that irritate elders.
#     timing: late childhood and early marriage (ages 10-22)
#     trait: High openness (75th percentile)
#   - consequence: Reduced functioning and higher household conflict; makes her more
#       dependent on kin and more vulnerable during illness outbreaks.
#     scene: After each infant death she has prolonged periods of low mood, slowed movement,
#       withdrawal, loss of appetite, and inability to start tasks; later recurrences
#       happen during debt years with hopeless talk ('nothing will change').
#     timing: major episodes around 699-701 and 703-705; chronic/recurring symptoms
#       through widowhood (711-721)
#     trait: Depressive disorder spectrum (recurrent/persistent)
#   - consequence: Earlier marriage and heightened surveillance; later, attractiveness
#       does not protect her much as a childless widow but shapes how people interpret
#       her behavior (more gossip, more scrutiny).
#     scene: As an adolescent she draws attention at festivals/wells; older women police
#       her movements and clothing more strictly, and the marriage match is pursued
#       quickly to avoid gossip.
#     timing: adolescence and early marriage (ages 13-20)
#     trait: Physical attractiveness (97th percentile)
# number_of_children: '2'
# number_of_siblings: '7'
# occupation: Household manager + agricultural laborer within family farming (weeding/harvest,
#   grain processing, cooking, water/fuel, childcare)
# religion: Brahmanical household ritual pattern (daily lamp/incense/food offerings,

#     time on thin millet/rice gruel while doing extra weeding and harvesting work for
#     better-off fields to help repay.

Mallamma was born on May 18, 679, in a farming hamlet near the low fields and thorn scrub of the Andhra country, under the authority of the Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi. People spoke a South-Central Dravidian vernacular in the yards and fields, and the household kept Brahmanical rites at home—lamp and incense at dawn, rice and flowers set before the household deities, and a priest called for the larger ceremonies.

She arrived late in a long line of children. Two brothers, Ravi and Kanna, had lived only hours; an older sister, Chenna, had not lasted a day. The surviving girls filled the compound. Satyamma, born in 668, moved through chores with quick hands and a sharp memory for who had borrowed what. Mallamma, born in 670, stayed small and then died in 676 after a short illness. Peddamma, born in 673, played at being a bride long before she married out. Komalamma, born in 681, followed Mallamma by two years and clung to her as if she were older than she was.

The family lived in an extended patrilineal compound. Narayana, Mallamma’s father, worked the household’s plots when water and labor allowed and took seasonal work for others when the stores ran thin. His brother Somayya lived in the same enclosure with his wife Subbamma. The elder, Timmanna, ruled the yard with his stick and his temper; his wife Lakshmamma set the women’s work and watched the grain jars. Mallamma’s mother Bhagyamma kept close to infants and hearth, with a string of small mourning rites behind her.

Mallamma grew into a striking child. At the well she drew stares earlier than the other girls, and Lakshmamma tightened the rules: hair oiled and braided, eyes lowered around visiting men, no lingering in the lane. Mallamma complied some days and resisted on others. She forgot tasks. She left the rice soaking too long or not at all. A pot boiled dry because she wandered off to sit in the shade behind the cattle shed and listen to older women singing while they pounded grain. When Subbamma shouted, Mallamma answered with a few hard words and then fell silent for the rest of the day.

At six she caught a fever after the rains. Bhagyamma kept her on a mat near the kitchen wall and fed her thin gruel and water flavored with tamarind. The household women tied a protective thread at her wrist and put a small lamp before the family shrine. When Mallamma stood again, she moved slowly, and Bhagyamma treated her as delicate when the mosquitoes thickened.

In 692, when Mallamma was thirteen, Timmanna died. The men shaved their heads and the women ate plain food for the mourning days. Somayya stepped forward as the senior man. He talked to Narayana about land shares and labor days, and he spoke more directly about what each woman owed the house. Subbamma’s voice carried farther now. Mallamma learned to keep out of her path, slipping away with Komalamma to the edges of the fields where women cut fodder and traded scraps of news.

Satyamma tried to manage her younger sister. She pulled Mallamma by the wrist to the threshing floor and pointed to the winnowing basket. “Do it before the sun moves.” Mallamma did it, then stopped halfway through, distracted by the rhythm of a work song drifting from another yard. Satyamma slapped the basket rim and cursed under her breath, then later that night brought Mallamma a small handful of fried gram and told her to eat.

Narayana’s work took him away during peak seasons. He came back smelling of other people’s smoke, tired and irritable, wanting food quickly. If the meal came late, he struck the floor with a stick and blamed the women. Mallamma took the scolding worse than Komalamma did. She stayed in the back, staring at the wall, and refused to talk even when Bhagyamma tried to coax her with stories.

By fifteen Mallamma’s looks had become a household concern. Men noticed her at festival gatherings when the family went to a nearby shrine with offerings of cooked rice, coconut, and flowers. Lakshmamma put her behind the older women and assigned Komalamma to keep her close. Mallamma disliked the crowding and noise, and she pulled away to sit near the temple wall where she could see without being pressed. She listened to traveling singers and remembered their lines better than she remembered where she had put the sickle.

A match was arranged in 695, when she was sixteen. Madhava belonged to a neighboring branch in the same village cluster, a cultivator with claims through his father and brothers. The wedding brought a priest, a fire, and the expected gifts—cloth, a little metal, grain. Mallamma moved into Madhava’s compound within the same locality, close enough that she still saw Komalamma at the well and could walk to her mother’s yard.

Married life demanded steadiness: grinding grain before dawn, drawing water, carrying seedlings, weeding in the heat. Mallamma did the work, then failed it. She rose late on planting days. She forgot where she had put the needle and accused another woman of taking it. When her sisters-in-law confronted her, she snapped and then withdrew, sitting by the back wall with her chin on her knees. Her beauty brought attention but not protection. Madhava wanted a wife who kept to routine tasks, and quarrels became common. He did not waste words; he laid out expectations and waited. Mallamma stared past him and said nothing until a sharp retort came out, surprising even her.

In 699 she delivered a son, Govinda. The women heated water, wiped the baby clean, and waited for a cry that did not come. Mallamma did not leave her bedding for days afterward. Bhagyamma came to sit with her, bringing soft rice and cumin water, whispering prayers to Lakshmi and to the ancestors. Mallamma pushed the bowl away, then suddenly demanded to know which vow had been missed and accused Bhagyamma of not lighting the lamp at the right time. When Bhagyamma answered, Mallamma turned her face to the wall and stopped speaking.

Peddamma, the older sister who had married out, died in 700 at twenty-seven. Word came with a messenger, and the women in Mallamma’s natal compound wailed. Mallamma heard and felt a tightness in her chest that did not ease. She began avoiding the courtyard, avoiding the well at busy hours, sending another woman if she could.

Lakshmamma, the grandmother, died in 702. Subbamma became harsher, measuring grain with a more careful eye. In 703 Mallamma bore a second son, Hari.

Hari lived only a short time. After the burial rites, Mallamma began keeping a string of small observances: plain food on certain days, extra lamps at dusk, a pinch of turmeric placed carefully at the threshold. She also grew quicker to anger. If anyone mentioned another woman's healthy child, Mallamma cut them off. Venkati, a neighbor who liked to linger at the well, once tried to comfort her with gossip and a joke about a foolish calf; Mallamma barked at her to stop talking and went home without her water pot. Komalamma carried it back later, laughing softly and then stopping when she saw Mallamma's face.

Narayana, her father, died in 707. Mallamma went to the cremation but stood apart from the other women, not wailing as loudly as custom expected. Bhagyamma watched her and said nothing.

Satyamma died in 709, forty-one years old, after a short illness that kept her thin and thirsty. Mallamma lost the one person who could scold her and still shield her. When Madhava died in 711, taken by an acute sickness after the rains, Mallamma’s position narrowed further. She shaved her head as a widow and wore plain cloth. With no living children, she remained in the joint household under her brothers-in-law. Somayya decided it; the fields and the compound were held by the agnatic line, and she stayed as labor and dependent.

The crisis hit the next year. In 712 the rains failed early and pests stripped a portion of what had grown. Grain prices rose at the market, and Rangayya, a local landholder and lender, offered loans against the next harvest. Somayya accepted. Jewelry was pawned. A sealed jar of rice meant for festivals was opened. Mallamma ate thin gruel and went out to weed and harvest for better-off fields in exchange for measures of grain. She returned sore and silent, then argued over rations, accusing Chandana, a brother-in-law’s wife, of taking more than her share. Chandana shouted back that Mallamma contributed nothing steady. Mallamma, furious, hid a small pouch of dried grain and tamarind behind the kitchen stones. When it was found, she denied it once, then shrugged and said it was for offerings.

Bhagyamma died in 713, worn down by years of loss and the lean season. Mallamma stopped sleeping through the night. She woke before dawn and sat by the cold hearth, staring at the ash until someone asked her to move. At other times she slept deep into the morning, and Subbamma yanked her up by the arm.

From 714 into 715 the household worked to repay Rangayya. Keshava, the headman’s messenger, came with notices of assessments and labor days, and Somayya sent men and women to dig and mend bunds and carry loads. Mallamma endured it, quiet in the line, then returned home and refused food. Komalamma, now married but still close by, slipped her a bit of sesame sweet on a festival day and got a brief smile in return. Mallamma liked those sweets and the first warm rice of a new harvest. She also liked sitting near the cattle at dusk when the courtyard emptied and the noise fell away.

The final illness came in 721. During the post-monsoon season she developed a persistent cough and fever. For days she kept working, then could not rise. The household gave her warmed water, and a small lamp burned at the shrine with offerings of flowers and cooked rice. The cough worsened, and she died on October 19, 721.

The men of the compound carried her body out to the cremation ground beyond the village. A fire was built, and after it burned down, the remaining bones and ash were gathered. A final offering of water and rice was made for her spirit and for the ancestors of the line that had housed her.
