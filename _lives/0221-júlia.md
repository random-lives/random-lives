#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds loyal customers and a small informal credit network; also
#       occasionally gets exploited (others ask for loans or favors), forcing her to
#       learn polite boundaries.
#     scene: At the market, she returns extra change to a customer and refuses to water
#       down cooking oil even when neighbors do; she gains a reputation as 'straight'
#       and people send relatives to buy from her.
#     timing: teens through adulthood (approx. 2012 onward)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (98th percentile)
#   - consequence: Household runs more smoothly; she is trusted with money and responsibilities,
#       but she carries heavy workload and fewer leisure opportunities.
#     scene: She keeps a school-and-chore schedule for siblings on a wall and a notebook
#       of market inventory and debts; she wakes early for water, cooking, and church
#       before trading.
#     timing: late childhood onward (approx. 2006 onward)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (86th percentile)
#   - consequence: Others lean on her as the steady one; she may appear emotionally
#       'closed' at times, processing stress privately through prayer and action.
#     scene: During clinic waits and shortages, she stays calm, speaks politely to staff,
#       and focuses on practical steps (who to call, what to buy) rather than panicking.
#     timing: caregiving years (2009–2014) and postpartum/early motherhood (2020–2022)
#     trait: Low Neuroticism (7th percentile)
#   - consequence: Improves household stability and moves from working-poor to modestly
#       secure; becomes informal advisor to siblings about money and schooling.
#     scene: She quickly learns mental arithmetic for pricing and profit, spots which
#       goods move fastest during inflation, and adapts by changing suppliers and package
#       sizes.
#     timing: late teens through mid-20s (2014–2025)

#   - consequence: Expands market network and church support; helps her manage co-parenting
#       and family requests through relationships.

#     accompanying them to a local clinic/pharmacy in the Luanda peri-urban area—while
#     still helping with her mother’s market trading and looking after younger siblings.'
#   reasoning: In a large, working-poor family with limited access to formal care, it’s
#     common for the eldest daughter to help nurse relatives through malaria, TB/HIV-related
#     illness, injury, or childbirth complications, often for weeks/months.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: approx. ages 12–17 (2009–2014), with the heaviest period over several months
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: 'Recurring pattern: Before any customary/cohabiting union was recognized,
#     she had a boyfriend in the neighborhood/market network and began a sexual relationship
#     privately, navigating church expectations by keeping it quiet and relying on friends/sisters
#     for discretion.'
#   reasoning: In Angola in this cohort, many relationships become sexual before any
#     formalization, and cohabiting unions typically begin after a premarital relationship.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: approx. ages 18–21 (2015–2018)
#   type: premarital_sex
# - event: 'Single event: She became pregnant before any formal civil/church marriage;
#     after telling her partner, they began living together in a customary/cohabiting
#     arrangement and leaned on her mother’s trading income and church support for prenatal
#     visits and baby supplies.'
#   reasoning: She has one child and is in a non-formalized union; births often occur
#     before civil/church marriage, so a pregnancy outside formal marriage is fairly
#     likely even if within a stable partnership.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: approx. ages 22–23 (2019–2020)

Júlia was born on 27 January 1997 on the edge of Luanda, when Angola was still ruled by the MPLA government and the civil war had not yet ended. Her parents, Domingos and Conceição, spoke Portuguese in public and Umbundu at home, with Júlia picking up Kimbundu words from neighbors and the market. Domingos wore a uniform for rank-and-file security work; he left before dawn and came back tired and watchful. Conceição sold food and small goods at an informal market, counting notes with quick fingers and a hard stare for anyone who tried to short her.

Júlia learned early to keep order inside a crowded house. Her mother set her to tasks that matched her age: rinsing cups, watching a pot, carrying a bucket that did not spill. When Ana was born in 1999, Júlia already knew how to hush a baby and how to warm water for washing. Paulo arrived in 2001 and Helena in 2003, and the compound got louder. Domingos insisted on greetings and quiet at night. Conceição insisted on neat school uniforms and clean feet before anyone climbed onto a mattress.

Peace came in 2002, and the neighborhood filled with talk about rebuilding. Men looked for construction jobs. Women expanded their stalls. New families arrived and rented rooms. Júlia started primary school in Portuguese and came home reciting lessons while she helped with cassava flour and dried fish. If a teacher sent a note, she carried it carefully in a folded plastic bag so it stayed legible. When money was tight, she asked her father directly what could be cut and what could not, then adjusted the household list she kept on scrap paper.

The church became a bigger part of the family’s weeks after Rita was born in 2007. A Pentecostal congregation met in a cinderblock building with plastic chairs and a loud speaker. On Sundays, Júlia sang in the children’s group and clapped until her palms warmed. On weekdays, Conceição joined women’s prayer meetings, and Júlia followed, sitting with Ana and Helena, listening to testimonies and calls for fasting. Irmã Lurdes, an older woman with a steady voice, told the girls to keep their skirts long and their words clean, and she made sure they ate if a meeting ran late.

The price jumps of 2008 hit their table fast. Conceição adjusted what she sold, shrinking portions, switching brands, buying less at a time. Júlia helped by doing mental arithmetic and writing down who owed what. If a neighbor asked for goods on credit, Júlia asked for a date and wrote it in a small notebook. She did not change numbers to flatter anyone. That made some people angry, but it kept the notebook clear.

Manuel was born in 2005 and Rita in 2007, and by the time João arrived in 2009 the house was full of children’s shoes and school papers. That same year Avó Teresa, Conceição’s mother, began spending longer stretches with them. She told Umbundu stories at night and corrected Júlia’s Umbundu when she mixed it with Portuguese. She also got sick. The illness started as weakness and coughing, then became days in bed. Júlia learned which pharmacy sold the cheaper tablets and which clinic line moved fastest. She woke before sunrise, swept the yard, set water to boil, and then sat by Avó Teresa to help her sip porridge and swallow pills.

In 2010, João fell ill as well. Conceição tried herbs and prayers before and after clinic visits. Domingos brought what he could from his salary, sometimes returning late because his shift was extended. Júlia carried João on her back when Conceição’s arms were tired, tying the cloth tight, counting steps so she didn’t stumble. João died before his second birthday. The church came to sing. Irmã Lurdes led prayers and held Conceição’s shoulders as she shook. Domingos stood stiff and silent. Júlia arranged cups for visitors and made sure Paulo and Manuel did not run into the adults’ legs.

The caregiving did not end with João’s death. Avó Teresa worsened again, and a relative from the extended family also needed help after an injury. Júlia kept doing what she had learned: cleaning, cooking, fetching water, walking to the clinic with a folder of papers. She still went to school. A teacher, Professor Almeida, noticed that she finished exercises early and asked her to explain them to other students. Júlia did it without fuss. She preferred tasks with clear answers. When classmates tried to coax her into skipping school, she refused and said she had work.

Sara was born in 2011 and Vitória in 2013, and Júlia’s role as the oldest solidified into routine. She learned to braid hair quickly, not for fashion but to keep it neat for school. She liked the early hours before heat and noise, when she could stand outside with a cup of sweet tea and plan the day. She laughed easily with Ana while they washed dishes, trading small jokes about customers’ manners and the way men tried to bargain without shame.

Avó Teresa died in 2013. The household held a wake with candles and prayer. Júlia helped manage the food and the chairs, and she kept the younger children from touching the plates before guests arrived. Afterward, the caregiving shifted back toward siblings. She pushed Paulo to take school seriously, and when Manuel resisted chores, she corrected him sharply and then moved on, leaving no room for argument.

By 2014, Júlia worked more hours alongside her mother at the market. She sold tomatoes, onions, dried fish, and sometimes cooking oil, depending on what Conceição could source. Júlia’s customers came back because she gave the right change and kept her goods clean. If she made a mistake, she admitted it immediately and fixed it. Dona Zefa, the stall neighbor, teased her for being too straight, then quietly steered a few reliable buyers her way.

In 2015, Júlia met Mateus through the market network. He helped move sacks and sometimes arranged transport when roads were crowded. They spoke in Portuguese, slipping into Umbundu when they wanted privacy. They began seeing each other after church events and in short meetings near the market. Júlia kept the relationship quiet at first. Irmã Lurdes warned the youth about temptation, and Júlia did not want her mother pulled into gossip. Still, she wanted companionship, and she liked that Mateus showed up when he said he would.

Their sexual relationship began in 2016. Júlia handled it the same way she handled money: with rules. She chose times and places that kept her safe, and she did not accept gifts that came with demands. She told Ana, who helped with excuses when Júlia needed to step away. During the yellow fever outbreak in 2016 and 2017, the neighborhood talked constantly about vaccination cards and fevers. Júlia stood in line for shots with her family, then returned to the market and told customers which clinic was moving faster.

The currency swings and shortages that followed made everything harder. Goods cost more; customers complained; suppliers demanded cash. Júlia started buying smaller quantities more often, watching what sold quickly. Sérgio, a wholesaler contact, offered short-term credit when he trusted her to pay on time. She paid on time. When others asked her to falsify prices or join a small scam, she refused and kept her face calm, as if the request had been ordinary and already answered.

She became pregnant in 2019. She told Mateus directly, then told her mother. Conceição scolded, then shifted into planning mode: prenatal appointments, food, savings. Júlia and Mateus began living together in a customary arrangement, without a civil or church ceremony. Irmã Lurdes pressed them to formalize, but Júlia chose stability over a public event they could not afford. In 2020, Júlia gave birth to a daughter, Mariana. After the birth she returned to trading, carrying Mariana on her back with a cloth, adjusting her stance so her shoulders didn’t ache.

The pandemic years hit markets and movement. Júlia adapted by focusing on a few dependable items and keeping her regular customers close. She continued church, smaller gatherings when needed, and kept praying at home: a short prayer at dawn, a longer one at night, hands on Mariana’s head. Mateus contributed when his work was steady and fell short when it wasn’t. Júlia argued with him about money, then wrote a new budget and stuck to it.

In 2025, Júlia lives in the Luanda area, still close to her parents and siblings. She runs her stall with a small notebook and a pen tucked behind her ear, greeting customers by name. Ana stops by to talk and laugh; Dona Zefa still comments on everyone’s business. At home, Mariana plays near the doorway while Júlia cooks and listens to church songs from a phone speaker. She lays out uniforms for the next day, counts cash once, and puts it away in the same place every night.
