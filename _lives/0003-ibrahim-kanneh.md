historical_notes:
  - "Sierra Leone’s 1991–2002 civil war ended just a few years before Ibrahim’s birth; many rural districts in the south, including Moyamba, spent the 2000s rebuilding basic services like schooling, roads, and clinics, which helps explain irregular education and difficult market access."
  - "The 2014–2016 West Africa Ebola epidemic led to nationwide restrictions in Sierra Leone (limits on movement and gatherings, school closures, and “no-touch” greetings), and it disrupted rural trade as transport and buying networks contracted or became riskier."
  - "In many Mende-speaking areas, Islam is practiced alongside pragmatic protective practices (amulets and visits to medicine specialists); these are often treated as everyday risk-management rather than a separate “religion,” so they can coexist without being openly debated."
  - "Sierra Leone’s rural economy relies heavily on smallholder farming and petty trade, where cash is scarce and prices are sensitive to fuel and transport costs; the 2021–2024 inflation and currency depreciation made it harder to budget, move produce to town, and buy imported essentials or farm inputs."

Ibrahim Kanneh was born on September 28, 2005, in Foya Tewei in Moyamba District. The rains were still on then. Mornings began with a wet heat that rose from the ground, and by afternoon the sky could turn dark without warning. When the harmattan came later, it brought dust and cooler nights, and the sound of people coughing in the early hours.

He was the sixth child in a house that stayed crowded. His parents were married and lived together, but the household stretched past them: an older relative on a mat in the front room, cousins drifting in and out, someone always sleeping at a neighbor’s place and returning with news. Space was shared and so were things. If Ibrahim left sandals by the door, someone wore them. If he set a cup down, it moved.

His father farmed for a living, planting rice and other food crops and keeping a few cash crops when the season allowed. His mother farmed too, but her day did not end at the field edge. She fetched water, cooked, scrubbed pots, and kept the younger ones from wandering into trouble. The family ate what they grew and sold what they could. When money came in, it went out fast—school needs, medicines, kerosene, soap.

At home they spoke Mende. Krio came with the market, with travelers, with radios turned up in the evenings. English belonged to school and government offices. Ibrahim learned to read simple lines on a page, enough to find his name on a list and make sense of short notices. Writing stayed difficult. He copied words slowly, and if someone stood over him he tightened up and made mistakes.

He grew up Muslim. In the mornings he washed and prayed when the house was quiet enough. On Fridays the mosque filled and men watched who showed up and who stayed away. During Ramadan, cooking shifted to before dawn and after dark, and the days carried a different temper. Alongside that was the other practice people did not debate much. When a child kept falling sick or a harvest failed twice, an amulet appeared under a shirt, or someone went to a man who knew medicines. Ibrahim saw it as part of how adults handled problems: prayer, work, and protection, all used without speeches.

He was orderly in a way that annoyed people. Even as a boy he lined things up—basin rinsed and turned upside down, school shirt folded, machete hung in the same place. If a younger sibling moved something, he demanded it back. He woke early without being called and acted as if time belonged to him. Adults trusted him with errands because he did not forget, and because he liked the feeling of being the one chosen.

He also liked attention. At the well he talked over other boys. On the path to the farms he walked in the middle and decided which way to go. He laughed fast and loud, and he pushed himself into conversations with older men as if he was already grown. He did not scare easily and he did not apologize quickly. If a rule blocked him, he stepped around it and waited for someone to challenge him.

When Ebola reached Sierra Leone in 2014, Ibrahim was eight. The word came first through radio talk and people returning from town, then the routines changed. Buckets appeared at doorways. People washed their hands in water that smelled of chlorine. Handshakes stopped or became awkward taps at a distance. Schools closed for long stretches, and when they reopened they closed again. Adults argued about what was real and what was lies, and Ibrahim listened with the patience of someone collecting information for later.

His father traveled less to sell produce. Buyers came less often, and when they did, they bargained harder. Ibrahim took on more work: more weeding, more carrying water, more time in the swamps where rice grew in the lower ground. He watched who still moved around and who stayed home, and he learned that fear could change prices.

By 2018, he was old enough to understand elections as something that reached the village. Party talk came with visitors, motorbikes, and promises. Some men spoke as if the vote was a debt owed to a patron. Others spoke as if old disputes could be settled with a new government. Ibrahim could not vote, but he found ways to be useful. He carried messages between houses. He listened at the edge of meetings and repeated what he heard, trimming details to keep himself safe. He learned which compounds offered tea and which offered questions.

School never held him cleanly. Fees were part of it, and missing teachers was part of it, but Ibrahim also hated sitting while he could be doing something that paid. He attended, then stopped, then returned when a relative insisted. He learned quickest by watching and repeating. If someone showed him a better spacing for rice, he used it the next day and corrected others. If someone told him the wrong thing, he remembered that too.

In his mid-teens he started spending more time in town and coming back again. He carried rice and palm oil to sell and returned with salt, soap, a spare part for a tool, sometimes a used shirt. In town, Krio mattered more than Mende, and he spoke it with confidence. He picked up a little more English the way he picked up everything else—by needing it. He could read a signboard slowly and count money, but he avoided forms and letters unless someone helped.

COVID-19 came when he was fourteen. In the village it did not arrive with the same visible panic as Ebola, but restrictions still reached them. Travel became harder. Market days thinned. People who depended on transport paid more, and sometimes there was no motorbike to hire at any price. Ibrahim reacted by tightening control over small things. He started keeping numbers in a notebook—what he spent on transport, what he earned from a sack of rice. His writing was cramped and ugly. Sometimes he asked someone to read back what he had written, then snapped if they laughed.

When prices rose in the years after, it changed the way he dealt with people. Fuel cost more and so did rides to town. A bar of soap became something you cut in half to make it last. When someone wanted to borrow money, Ibrahim asked what they would give back and when. He stopped pretending loans were gifts. His mother complained that he talked like a trader. He said he was tired of working for nothing.

In 2022, heavy rains tore up the road on the route he used to sell. Mud swallowed motorbike tires. Loads that used to ride to town went on heads again. One week a low patch of his rice flooded and lay flat in the water. Ibrahim stood in it, silent, jaw tight, then took a hoe and cut channels until the water moved. He worked until his palms opened. Two older men watched and nodded. Ibrahim nodded back as if their attention was owed to him.

In the 2023 election season, the village filled again with talk and movement. Men who complained about the price of salt still found money for a rally ride or a party shirt. Ibrahim watched and judged them. He did not spend on politics unless it bought him something. He went where important people were, greeted loudly, and made sure they saw him.

That year he made a profit that turned into a quarrel. A neighbor needed cash fast and offered produce cheap. Ibrahim bought it without arguing, then sold it later when the price rose. When the neighbor came back angry, Ibrahim did not soften it. He said in Krio that nobody forced anybody. The argument lasted weeks. An elder called Ibrahim aside and told him a young man built a name by how he treated people who were down. Ibrahim listened, eyes steady, and said he understood. He kept the money.

By twenty he was doing better than his parents had at the same age. A relative let him use extra land, and Ibrahim worked it hard and watched it closely. He planned his trips to town around who was buying and what the road could take. He stayed visible, sitting at the edge of a group and pushing into the center when the talk mattered. He was still unmarried and not living with a partner. In his family, it was accepted because he brought home cash and goods, and because he did not ask permission the way some young men did.

On a dry-season morning, he woke before the first call from the mosque carried across the trees. He washed, prayed, and ate rice left from the night before. Outside, the air held a brief coolness. He checked a sack tied with twine and pressed the knot with his thumb. He lifted it to test the weight, set it down, and adjusted it once more as if the day would go wrong unless he touched each thing in the right order. Then he stepped onto the path toward the road, already calling out to someone ahead, his voice loud in the quiet.
