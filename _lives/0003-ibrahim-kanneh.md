historical_notes:
  - "Ibrahim Kanneh’s stated ethnolinguistic background (Mende / Southern Sierra Leone cultural sphere) and everyday language ecology (Mende at home; Krio for market/travel; limited school-based English) aligns with Moyamba District’s Southern Province setting, where Mende is widely spoken and Krio is commonly used as a trade lingua franca."
  - "The 2014–2016 West African Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone (approximately 14,000 reported cases and nearly 4,000 deaths nationally) coincided with Ibrahim’s ages 8–10 and is consistent with the narrative’s described school disruption, altered greetings/handwashing practices, and reduced rural movement and trading during that period."
  - "Sierra Leone’s leone depreciation and elevated inflation during roughly 2021–2024 are a concrete national backdrop for the narrative’s late-teen experience of higher fuel/transport costs and tighter household budgeting on farm-to-town trading trips."
  - "In contemporary rural Sierra Leone (including Moyamba District), many life details like household disputes, informal trading arrangements, and recourse to local ‘medicine’/ritual specialists are typically documented, if at all, through oral testimony and community/chiefdom-level knowledge rather than comprehensive public written records—so those elements are plausible but not independently verifiable without interviews or local records."

Ibrahim Kanneh was born on September 28, 2005, in a small settlement in Moyamba District. In the rainy season the mornings came hot and wet, and by afternoon the sky could turn dark fast. Later in the year the harmattan dust settled on everything and people coughed before sunrise.

He was the sixth child in a crowded compound. His parents lived together, but the house held more than them. An older relative slept in the front room. Cousins arrived for weeks and left again. Children rotated between neighbors’ houses and came back with stories. Things did not stay where you put them. If Ibrahim left sandals by the door, someone wore them. If he set down a cup, it moved.

His father farmed rice and other food crops and kept a small patch for cash when he could. His mother farmed and did the housework that never ended. She fetched water, cooked, scrubbed pots, and kept the younger ones from drifting into the road. They ate what they grew and sold what they could. When cash came in it vanished into school fees, medicine, kerosene, soap.

At home they spoke Mende. Krio belonged to the market and the radio. English belonged to school and offices. Ibrahim learned to read simple lines and recognize his name on a list. He wrote badly. When he needed to record something, he copied numbers slowly and filled the page with crossed-out mistakes.

He grew up Muslim. Before dawn he washed from a basin and prayed while the compound was still quiet. On Fridays the mosque filled and men noticed who came late and who stayed away. In Ramadan the cooking moved to early morning and night. Alongside that, people used what they called medicine. If sickness stayed in a house or a harvest failed twice, someone brought an amulet, or they visited a man who mixed leaves and powders. Ibrahim did not argue about it. He watched who paid, who promised, and who pretended they had not.

He liked order and control. As a boy he lined up plastic cups on the shelf and turned the basin upside down in the same place every time. He hung the machete where he could see it from the doorway. If a younger sibling touched his things he took them back and shouted until an adult stopped him. Adults sent him on errands because he did not forget and because he liked being trusted.

He also pushed himself into every space. At the well he talked over other boys. On the path to the farms he walked in the middle and chose the turn without asking. He laughed loud and interrupted older men as if he owned the talk. When someone challenged him he stared until the other person looked away. If a rule blocked him, he searched for the gap and used it.

When Ebola hit Sierra Leone in 2014, Ibrahim was eight. The warning came through radios and people returning from town, then the village routines changed. Buckets appeared at doorways. Hands washed in water that stung with chlorine. Greetings turned into awkward taps, or nothing at all. School shut down, reopened, shut again. Adults argued about what was true. Ibrahim listened, then repeated the parts that made him look informed.

His father stopped traveling as much to sell produce. Buyers came less often and pushed prices down. Ibrahim did more work in the fields—more weeding, more carrying water, more time in the low wet ground where rice grew. He noticed who still moved between villages and who stayed inside their houses, and he learned that fear could change the price of food.

School never held him. Fees mattered, and teachers disappeared for weeks, but Ibrahim also hated sitting still when there was work to do. He attended, then stopped, then returned when an uncle insisted. He learned by watching. When someone showed him a better spacing for rice, he copied it and told others they were doing it wrong. When someone gave him bad advice, he remembered it and later used it against them in an argument.

In 2018 the elections brought visitors, motorbikes, and party talk. Men arrived in the village with lists and promises. Ibrahim could not vote, but he made himself useful to people who mattered. He carried messages, stood close to meetings, and repeated what he heard to the side that could pay him back later. He did not do it for belief. He did it to be seen.

By his mid-teens he spent more time going to town and coming back. He carried rice and palm oil to sell and returned with salt, soap, and small spare parts. In town he spoke Krio with confidence and acted as if he belonged there. He picked up a little English from signs and from the way people talked at shops, but he avoided forms and letters. If a paper had to be filled, he handed it to someone else and watched their pen.

COVID-19 came when he was fourteen. Travel tightened. Market days thinned. Checkpoints and rules made movement slower, and sometimes the motorbikes stopped running early. Ibrahim responded by trying to lock down what he could. He kept a small notebook and filled it with numbers, mostly wrong on the first try. He asked another boy to read the totals back to him, then snapped if the boy smiled.

From 2021 into 2023 prices climbed and stayed high. Fuel got expensive and rides to town cost more. Soap became something you cut and saved. Ibrahim stopped lending money the way people in the compound expected. When someone asked, he asked what they would return and on what day. If they hesitated, he told them to go to someone else. His mother said he talked like a trader. He answered that he was tired of working and watching other people eat.

In the 2022 rainy season the road he used broke in places. Mud swallowed motorbike tires and loads went on heads again. A low patch of his rice flooded and lay flat. Ibrahim stood in the water with his jaw tight, then cut channels with a hoe until the water moved. He worked until his palms split. Two older men watched and nodded. Ibrahim nodded back without thanking them.

The 2023 election season brought more movement and louder talk. Men who complained about the price of salt still found money for a rally ride and a party shirt. Ibrahim watched who spent and who received. He went where important people sat, greeted them loudly, and made sure his face stayed in front of them. He did not give his time for free.

That year he made a profit that turned into a quarrel. A neighbor needed cash and offered produce cheap. Ibrahim bought it immediately, then sold it later when the price rose. When the neighbor returned angry, Ibrahim did not soften his voice. He said in Krio that nobody forced anybody. The argument carried for weeks. An elder called him aside and told him a young man built a name by how he treated people who were down. Ibrahim listened without looking away and said he understood. He kept the money and stopped greeting the neighbor.

By eighteen he was doing better than his parents had at the same age. A relative let him use extra land and Ibrahim worked it hard and guarded it as if it could be stolen by looking at it. He planned his trips to town around who was buying and what the road could carry. He stayed visible, sitting at the edge of groups and pushing into the center when the talk mattered. He was still unmarried and not living with a partner. In his family it was accepted because he brought home cash and goods, and because he did not ask permission the way other young men did.

On a dry-season morning he woke before the first call to prayer carried across the trees. He washed, prayed, and ate rice left from the night before. Outside the air held a short coolness. He checked a sack tied with twine and pressed the knot with his thumb. He lifted it to test the weight, set it down, then adjusted it again. When he stepped onto the path toward the road he called out to someone ahead, loud enough for the compound to hear, as if the day had to start on his voice.
