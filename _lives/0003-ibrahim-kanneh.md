historical_notes:
  - "Moyamba District lies in Sierra Leone’s Southern Province; rural livelihoods there commonly center on rainfed upland rice plus swamp/boliland plots, with rainy-season laterite roads that can become impassable and raise transport costs to towns like Moyamba and Bo."
  - "The Mende are among Sierra Leone’s largest ethnic groups and are concentrated in the Southern and Eastern Provinces; many rural Mende households combine subsistence rice farming with cash from palm oil, peppers/vegetables, or small trading—close to Ibrahim’s farm-and-market pattern."
  - "Sierra Leone is typically trilingual by function: Mende (home/community) plus Krio (markets/transport/radio) plus school English (official forms and administration), so fluent Krio alongside weak reading/writing in English is common in rural-to-town movers."
  - "The 2014–2016 Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone caused roughly 14,000 cases and about 4,000 deaths nationwide and brought school closures, travel restrictions, and market disruptions, consistent with chlorine handwashing stations and reduced produce trading described for Ibrahim’s childhood."
  - "Sierra Leone held presidential/parliamentary elections in 2018 and 2023; both cycles were marked by intensive local campaigning and patronage networks (rallies, motorbike mobilization, gifts), fitting the narrative’s “envelopes,” brokers, and heightened community political activity."
  - "From 2021–2024 Sierra Leone faced steep inflation and currency depreciation, with fuel-price spikes translating quickly into higher okada (motorbike taxi) fares and thinner farm-gate margins—matching Ibrahim’s focus on transport costs, price volatility, and harder bargaining."

Ibrahim Kanneh was born on September 28, 2005, in a small settlement in Moyamba District. In the rains the mornings came hot and wet, and by afternoon the sky could turn dark in a minute. In the dry season dust rode in on the wind for a few weeks and people woke with dry throats.

He was the sixth child in a crowded compound. His parents lived together, but the rooms held more than them. An older relative slept in the front room. Cousins arrived and stayed, then left again. Children rotated between neighbors’ houses and came back with news. Things did not stay where you put them. If Ibrahim left sandals by the doorway, someone wore them. If he set down a cup, it moved.

His father farmed rice and other food crops and kept a small patch for cash when he could. His mother farmed and did the work that never ended. She fetched water, cooked, scrubbed pots, and kept the younger ones from wandering onto the path. They ate what they grew and sold what they could. When cash came in it went into school fees, medicine, kerosene, soap.

At home they spoke Mende. Krio belonged to the market and the radio. English belonged to school and offices. Ibrahim learned to read short lines and recognize his name on a list. He wrote badly. When he needed to keep track of something, he drew columns of figures and scratched them out, then asked someone else to tell him what he had totaled.

He grew up Muslim. Before dawn he washed from a basin and prayed while the compound was still quiet. On Fridays he went to the mosque when he could. Men noticed who showed up and who stayed away. In Ramadan the cooking moved to early morning and night. Alongside that, people used what they called medicine. If sickness stayed in a house or a harvest failed twice, someone brought an amulet, or they went to a man who mixed leaves and powders. Ibrahim did not argue. He watched who paid, who promised, and who denied it afterward.

He wanted things fixed in place. As a boy he lined up plastic cups on a shelf and put the washbasin upside down in the same spot each time. He hung the machete where he could see it from the doorway. If a younger sibling touched his things he snatched them back and shouted until an adult stopped him. Adults sent him on errands because he did not forget and because he liked being the one chosen.

He also pushed himself into every space. At the well he talked over other boys. On the path to the farms he walked in the middle and chose the turn without asking. He laughed loud and cut into older men’s talk. When someone challenged him he held his stare until the other person looked away. If a rule blocked him, he searched for the gap and used it.

When Ebola hit in 2014, Ibrahim was eight. The warning came through radios and people returning from town, and then routines changed. Buckets appeared at doorways. Hands washed in water that bit with chlorine. Greetings turned into an awkward touch of elbows, or nothing. School shut down. Adults argued about what was true and what was said to scare them. Ibrahim listened and repeated the parts that made him sound informed.

His father stopped traveling as much to sell produce. Buyers came less often and pushed prices down. Ibrahim did more work in the fields—more weeding, more carrying water, more time in the low wet ground where rice grew. He watched who still moved between villages and who locked their doors. He learned that fear could change the price of food.

School never held him. Fees mattered and teachers disappeared for weeks, but he also hated sitting still when there was work to do. He attended, then stopped, then returned when an uncle pressed him. He learned by watching. When someone showed him better spacing for rice, he copied it and told others they were doing it wrong. When someone gave him bad advice, he stored it and brought it back later in an argument.

In 2018 the elections brought visitors, motorbikes, and party talk. Men came through with loudspeakers, names of candidates, and envelopes handed out behind palms. Ibrahim could not vote, but he made himself useful to people who mattered. He carried messages, stood close to meetings, and repeated what he heard to whichever side might remember him later. He did not do it for belief. He did it to be seen.

By his mid-teens he spent more time going to town and coming back. He carried rice and palm oil to sell and returned with salt, soap, and small spare parts. In town he spoke Krio with confidence and acted as if he belonged there. He picked up a little English from shop signs and the way people talked at counters, but he avoided forms and letters. If a paper had to be filled, he handed it to someone else and watched their pen.

COVID-19 came when he was fourteen. Travel tightened. Market days thinned. Checkpoints slowed movement and sometimes the motorbikes stopped early. Ibrahim tried to control what he could. He kept a small notebook and filled it with simple prices and debts, then crossed out half the page and started again. When another boy read the totals back to him, Ibrahim snapped if the boy laughed.

From 2021 into 2023 prices climbed and stayed high. Fuel got expensive and rides to town cost more. Soap became something you cut and saved. Ibrahim stopped lending money the way people in the compound expected. When someone asked, he asked what they would return and on what day. If they hesitated, he told them to go to someone else. His mother said he talked like a trader. He answered that he was tired of working and watching other people eat.

In the 2022 rains the road he used broke in places. Mud swallowed motorbike tires and loads went on heads again. A low patch of his rice flooded and lay flat. Ibrahim stood in the water with his jaw tight, then cut channels with a hoe until the water moved. He worked until his palms split. Two older men watched. When they nodded at him, he nodded back and kept working.

The 2023 election season brought more movement and louder talk. Men who complained about the price of salt still found money for a rally ride and a party shirt. Ibrahim watched who spent and who received. He went where the local brokers sat, greeted them loudly, and kept his face in front of them. He did not give his time for free.

That year he made a profit that turned into a quarrel. A neighbor needed cash and offered produce cheap. Ibrahim bought it at once, then sold it later when the price rose in town. When the neighbor returned angry, Ibrahim did not soften his voice. He said in Krio that nobody forced anybody. The argument carried for weeks. An elder called him aside and told him a young man built a name by how he treated people when they were down. Ibrahim listened without looking away and said he understood. He kept the money and stopped greeting the neighbor.

By eighteen he was doing better than his parents had at the same age. A relative let him use extra land and Ibrahim worked it hard and guarded it as if it could be taken by a glance. He planned his trips to town around who was buying and what the road could carry. He stayed visible, sitting at the edge of groups and pushing into the center when the talk mattered. He was still unmarried and not living with a partner. In his family it was accepted because he brought home cash and goods, and because he did not ask permission the way other young men did.

On a dry-season morning he woke before dawn. Someone nearby called the first prayer and the sound threaded through the compound. Ibrahim washed, prayed, and ate rice left from the night before. Outside the air held a short coolness. He checked a sack tied with twine and pressed the knot with his thumb. He lifted it to test the weight, set it down, then adjusted it again. When he stepped onto the path toward the road he called out to someone ahead, loud enough for the compound to hear, as if the day had to start on his voice.
