historical_notes:
  - "Ibrahim was born in 2005, three years after Sierra Leone’s civil war officially ended (2002), during a period of uneven rebuilding of roads, schools, and clinics in rural districts such as Moyamba."
  - "The 2014–2016 Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone recorded about 14,000 cases and nearly 4,000 deaths, and it led to months of school closures plus limits on travel and public gatherings."
  - "Sierra Leone’s population rose from about 5.0 million (2004 census) to about 7.1 million (2015 census), increasing competition for land and pushing many young people into regular village–town movement for school, trading, and seasonal work."
  - "Compared with many urban youths of his age in Sierra Leone, a rural smallholder in Moyamba is more likely to leave school early and have limited English literacy, while relying on Krio for markets and Mende at home."
  - "In 2018 and 2023 Sierra Leone held tightly contested national elections; in many provincial areas, campaigns often moved through local “big men,” chiefs, and youth organizers, with transport, small cash gifts, and party events used to mobilize supporters."

Ibrahim Kanneh was born on September 28, 2005, in a small settlement in Moyamba District. In the rains the mornings came hot and wet, and by afternoon the sky could darken in a minute. In the dry season harmattan dust drifted in for weeks and people woke with dry throats.

He was the sixth child in a crowded compound. His parents lived together, but the rooms held more than them. An older relative slept in the front room. Cousins arrived and stayed, then left again. Children rotated through neighbors’ houses and came back with news. Things did not stay where you put them. If Ibrahim left sandals by the doorway, someone wore them. If he set down a cup, it moved.

His father farmed rice and other food crops and kept a small patch for cash when he could. His mother farmed and did the work that never ended. She fetched water, cooked, scrubbed pots, and kept the younger ones from wandering onto the path. They ate what they grew and sold what they could. When money came in it went into school fees, medicine, kerosene, soap.

At home they spoke Mende. Krio belonged to the market and the radio. English belonged to school and offices. Ibrahim learned to read short lines and recognize his name on a list. He wrote badly. When he needed to keep track of something, he made columns of numbers, crossed them out, and pushed the page to someone else to read back what he had.

He grew up Muslim. Before dawn he washed from a basin and prayed while the compound was still quiet. On Fridays he went to the mosque when he could. Men noticed who showed up and who stayed away. In Ramadan the cooking moved to early morning and night. Alongside that, people used what they called medicine. If sickness stayed in a house or a harvest failed twice, someone brought an amulet, or they went to a man who mixed leaves and powders. Ibrahim did not debate it. He watched who paid, who claimed it worked, and who denied they ever went.

He liked order and control. As a boy he lined up plastic cups on a shelf and put the washbasin upside down in the same spot each time. He hung the machete where he could see it from the doorway. If a younger sibling touched his things he snatched them back and shouted until an adult intervened. People used him for errands because he kept track and because he would not let others delay him.

He also forced himself into attention. At the well he talked over other boys. On the path to the farms he walked in the middle and chose the turn without asking. He laughed loud and cut into older men’s talk. When someone challenged him he held his stare until the other person looked away. If a rule blocked him, he searched for the gap and used it.

When Ebola came in 2014 he was eight. The warning came through radios and people returning from town, and then routines changed. Buckets appeared at doorways. Hands washed in water that bit with chlorine. People stopped shaking hands. School shut down. Adults argued about what was true and what was said to control them. Ibrahim listened and repeated the parts that made him sound as if he knew more than the next person.

His father cut travel to sell produce. Buyers came less often and pushed prices down. Ibrahim did more work in the fields—more weeding, more carrying water, more time in the low wet ground where rice grew. He watched who still moved between villages and who stayed inside their fences. He learned that fear could change the price of food.

School never held him. Fees mattered and teachers disappeared for weeks, but he also refused to sit still when there was work outside. He attended, then stopped, then returned when an uncle pressed him. He learned by watching. When someone showed him better spacing for rice, he copied it and told others they were doing it wrong. When someone gave him bad advice, he stored it and brought it back later, not to correct them but to win.

In 2018 the elections brought visitors, motorbikes, and party talk. Men came through with loudspeakers, names of candidates, and small envelopes passed behind palms. Ibrahim could not vote, but he made himself useful to people who were watched. He carried messages, stood close to meetings, and repeated what he heard to whichever side might remember his face later. He did it to be noticed.

By his mid-teens he spent more time going to town and coming back. He carried rice and palm oil to sell and returned with salt, soap, and small spare parts. In town he spoke Krio with confidence and acted as if he belonged there. He picked up a little English from shop signs and the way people talked at counters, but he avoided forms and letters. If paper had to be filled, he handed it to someone else and watched their pen.

COVID-19 came when he was fourteen. Travel tightened. Market days thinned. Checkpoints slowed movement and sometimes motorbikes stopped early. Ibrahim tried to control what he could. He kept a small notebook of prices and debts, filled it, tore out pages, and started again. When another boy read the totals back to him, Ibrahim snapped if the boy smiled.

After that, prices climbed and did not come down. Fuel went up and rides to town cost more. Imported goods rose fast. Soap became something you cut and saved. Ibrahim stopped lending money the way people in the compound expected. When someone asked, he asked what they would return and on what day. If they hesitated, he told them to go to someone else. His mother said he talked like a hard trader. He answered that he was tired of working and watching other people eat.

In the rains the road he used broke in places. Mud swallowed motorbike tires and loads went on heads again. A low patch of his rice flooded and lay flat. Ibrahim stood in the water with his jaw set, then cut channels with a hoe until it drained. He worked until his palms split. Two older men watched him without helping. When they nodded at him, he nodded back and kept working.

The 2023 election season brought more movement and louder talk. Men who complained about the price of salt still found money for a rally ride and a party shirt. Ibrahim watched who spent and who received. He went where the local brokers sat, greeted them loudly, and kept his face in front of them. If someone tried to send him away, he stayed anyway.

That year he made a profit that turned into a quarrel. A neighbor needed cash and offered produce cheap. Ibrahim bought it at once, then sold it later in town when the price rose. When the neighbor returned angry, Ibrahim did not lower his voice. He said in Krio that nobody forced anybody. The argument carried for weeks. An elder called him aside and told him a young man built a name by how he treated people when they were down. Ibrahim listened without looking away and said he understood. He kept the money and stopped greeting the neighbor.

By eighteen he was doing better than his parents had at the same age. A relative let him use extra land and Ibrahim worked it hard and guarded it as if it could be taken by a glance. He planned his trips to town around who was buying and what the road could carry. He stayed visible, sitting at the edge of groups and stepping into the center when the talk mattered. He was still unmarried and not living with a partner. In his family it was accepted because he brought home cash and goods, and because he did not ask permission the way other young men did.

On a dry-season morning he woke before dawn. Someone nearby called the first prayer and the sound threaded through the compound. Ibrahim washed, prayed, and ate rice left from the night before. Outside, the air held a short coolness. He checked a sack tied with twine and pressed the knot with his thumb. He lifted it to test the weight, set it down, then adjusted it again. When he stepped onto the path toward the road he called out to someone ahead, loud enough for the compound to hear, as if the day had to start on his voice.
