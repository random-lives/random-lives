historical_notes:
  - "Sierra Leone’s civil war (1991–2002) ended only three years before he was born; many rural families in the south spent the 2000s rebuilding farms and compounds after displacement, looting, and the loss of tools and seed stock."
  - "Rice farming in southern Sierra Leone is often split between upland “slash-and-burn” plots and lowland inland-valley swamps; the lowland system can yield more but is vulnerable to floods, blocked drainage, and labor crunches during planting and weeding."
  - "During the 2014–2016 Ebola crisis, Sierra Leone recorded roughly 14,000 cases and nearly 4,000 deaths; bans on gatherings and disrupted trade pushed down farmgate prices and scrambled seasonal labor in many rural chiefdoms."
  - "Sierra Leone’s lockdowns and travel limits during COVID-19 (2020–2021) disrupted weekly market cycles; missing one or two key market days could mean forced selling at lower prices or eating seed stocks meant for planting."
  - "Fuel price spikes in the early 2020s hit rural areas hard because most cash marketing depends on motorbikes and shared taxis; when pump prices rise, the cost per bag to reach a town market can jump faster than the farmgate price of the crop."
  - "Sierra Leone saw sharp inflation and currency depreciation in the 2021–2024 period; in many towns, prices of imported basics (soap, cooking oil, batteries) rose faster than local crop prices, squeezing households that sell produce but buy manufactured goods."

Ibrahim Kanneh was born on September 28, 2005, in a small settlement in Moyamba District. In the rains, mornings started already warm. By afternoon the sky could turn and the paths filled. In the dry months, harmattan came and people woke with dry throats and grit in their noses.

He was the sixth child in a crowded compound. His parents lived together, but the rooms did not belong to one household alone. An older relative took the front room. Cousins came in from other villages for weeks at a time, then left again. Children slept where there was space and ate where food was cooking. Things moved. If Ibrahim left sandals by the doorway, someone wore them. If he put down a cup, it ended up in another hand.

His father farmed rice and other food crops and kept a small patch for cash when he could. His mother farmed and did the work that never ended. She fetched water, cooked, scrubbed pots, and kept the smaller ones from stepping into the road when motorbikes passed. They ate what they grew and sold what they could. When money came in it went to school fees, medicine, kerosene, soap.

At home they spoke Mende. Krio belonged to the market and the radio. English belonged to school and offices. Ibrahim learned to read short lines and recognize his name on a list. He wrote poorly. When he needed to keep track, he made tallies and columns of numbers, circles and crossed marks, and then shoved the paper at someone to read the totals back to him.

He grew up Muslim. Before dawn he washed from a basin and prayed while the compound was still quiet. On Fridays he went to the mosque when he could. People noticed who turned up and who didn’t. In Ramadan the cooking shifted to early morning and night and the days stretched. Alongside prayer, people used medicine. If sickness stayed in a house or a harvest failed twice, someone brought an amulet, or they went to a man who mixed leaves and powders and gave instructions. Ibrahim did not argue about it. He watched who paid, who claimed it worked, and who denied they ever went.

He liked order, but on his own terms. As a boy he lined up plastic cups on a shelf and put the washbasin upside down in the same spot each time. He hung the machete where he could see it from the doorway. If a younger sibling touched his things he snatched them back and shouted until an adult told him to stop. People sent him on errands because he did not forget what he was told and because he hated delays.

He also pushed himself into attention. At the well he talked over other boys. On the path to the farms he walked in the middle and chose the turn without asking. He laughed loud and cut into older men’s talk until someone told him to mind himself. He didn’t apologize. He stood close, listened harder, then found a small job to make himself useful—carrying a load, running to a shop, fetching a phone charger from town—so he could stay near the talk.

When Ebola came in 2014 he was eight. News came through radios and people returning from town, then routines changed. Buckets appeared at doorways. Hands washed in water that stung with chlorine. People stopped shaking hands. School shut down. Adults argued about what was true and what was said to control them. Ibrahim listened and repeated the parts that made him sound informed, even when he didn’t understand them.

His father cut travel to sell produce. Buyers came less often and pushed prices down. Ibrahim did more work in the fields—more weeding, more carrying water, more time in the low wet ground where rice grew. He watched who still moved between villages and who stayed behind fences. He learned that fear could change the price of food and the way people treated each other at a doorway.

School never held him. Fees mattered and teachers disappeared for weeks, but Ibrahim also refused to sit still when there was work outside. He went for stretches, then stopped, then went back when an uncle pressed him. He was careful with tasks he chose and careless with ones he didn’t. In the swamp he planted in straight lines and corrected other boys. In the classroom he disrupted lessons, challenged the teacher over small things, then walked out when he felt watched.

In 2018 the elections brought visitors, motorbikes, and party talk. Men came through with loudspeakers and posters and sacks of rice for meetings. There was transport money for rallies and drinks after dark. Ibrahim could not vote, but he made himself useful to people who were watched. He carried messages, stood at the edge of meetings, and repeated what he heard to whichever side might remember his face later. When someone told him to move away, he moved a few steps and stayed where he could still hear.

By his mid-teens he spent more time going to town and coming back. He carried rice and palm oil to sell and returned with salt, soap, and small spare parts. In town he spoke Krio with confidence and acted as if he belonged there. He picked up a little English from shop signs and the way people spoke at counters, but when paper had to be filled he pushed it to someone else and watched their pen.

COVID-19 came when he was fourteen. Travel tightened. Market days thinned. Checkpoints slowed movement and sometimes motorbikes stopped early. Ibrahim tried to control what he could. He kept a small notebook of prices and debts—numbers, dates, names written crookedly—and he guarded it. If someone teased him for asking them to read it back, he snapped and shut it.

After that, prices climbed and did not come down. Fuel went up and rides to town cost more. Imported goods rose fast. Soap became something you cut and saved. Ibrahim stopped lending money the way people in the compound expected. When someone asked, he asked what they would return and on what day. If they hesitated, he told them to go to someone else. His mother said he talked like a hard trader. He answered that he was tired of working and watching other people eat.

In the rains the road he used broke in places. Mud swallowed motorbike tires and loads went on heads again. One season a low patch of his rice flooded and lay flat. Ibrahim stood in the water with his jaw set, then cut channels with a hoe until it drained. He worked until his palms split. Two older men watched from the edge. One of them told him he couldn’t fight the sky. Ibrahim didn’t answer. When they finally nodded at him, he nodded back and kept working.

The 2023 election season brought more movement and louder talk. Men who complained about the price of salt still found money for a rally ride and a party shirt. Ibrahim watched who spent and who received. He went where local brokers sat, greeted them loudly, and stayed close. He learned which names opened a gate and which names got you chased.

That year he made a profit that turned into a quarrel. A neighbor needed cash and offered produce cheap. Ibrahim bought it at once, then sold it later in town when the price rose. When the neighbor returned angry, Ibrahim did not lower his voice. He said in Krio that nobody forced anybody and that hunger was not his fault. The argument carried for weeks. People stopped laughing when Ibrahim came near. An elder called him aside and told him a young man built a name by how he treated people when they were down. Ibrahim listened without looking away and said he understood. He kept the money and stopped greeting the neighbor. After that he traded more carefully, not kinder—quiet deals, fewer witnesses, less talk.

By eighteen he was doing better than his parents had at the same age. A relative let him use extra land and Ibrahim worked it hard and guarded it as if it could be taken by a glance. He planned his trips to town around who was buying and what the road could carry. He stayed visible, sitting at the edge of groups and stepping into the center when the talk mattered. He was still unmarried and not living with a partner. In his family it was accepted because he brought home cash and goods, and because when someone tried to direct him he acted as if he hadn’t heard.

On a dry-season morning he woke before dawn. Someone nearby called the first prayer and the sound threaded through the compound. Ibrahim washed, prayed, and ate rice left from the night before. Outside, the air held a short coolness. He checked a sack tied with twine and pressed the knot with his thumb. He lifted it to test the weight, set it down, then adjusted it again until it sat the way he wanted. When he stepped onto the path toward the road he called out to someone ahead, loud enough for the compound to hear, as if the day had to start on his voice.
