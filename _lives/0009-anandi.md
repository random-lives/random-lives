#       child and intensifies parental pressure around marriage and duty.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Less access to social support outside the household; harder to mobilize
#       natal-kin help during domestic violence or crises.
#     scene: She avoids speaking in the village courtyard meetings and lets others bargain
#       at market; when guests arrive she stays at the edge, listening and serving rather
#       than joining conversation.
#     timing: especially visible after marriage (ages 16-37)
#     trait: Extraversion (very low)
#   - consequence: Maintains day-to-day peace and cooperation, but also enables others
#       to over-demand labor and tolerate mistreatment.
#     scene: After disputes she is the one who brings water, offers the first conciliatory
#       words, and smooths tensions between in-laws; she yields in arguments even when
#       she is right to keep the household functioning.
#     timing: adolescence onward, strongest in joint-household years (ages 13-37)
#     trait: Agreeableness (very high)
#   - consequence: Builds a reputation for trustworthiness inside the kin network; reduces
#       conflict with neighbors but can leave her household less opportunistic during
#       hardship.
#     scene: She refuses to short-measure grain or hide a neighbor’s tool found near
#       the threshing floor; she returns small items and insists on proper sharing of
#       gleanings even when food is tight.
#     timing: adult life managing stores and harvest processing (ages 18-37)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (very high)
#   - consequence: Stability and predictability, but slower adoption of potentially
#       helpful innovations (new cures, new crop practices).
#     scene: She prefers familiar rituals and customary food/fasting routines, distrusts
#       novel remedies from traveling mendicants, and sticks to elders’ ways of planting
#       and household observance.
#     timing: throughout life, salient in crises (ages 7-37)
#     trait: Openness (low)
# number_of_children: '8'
# number_of_siblings: '4'
# occupation: Peasant household and farm laborer (domestic work + seasonal agricultural
#   work on family holding; small livestock care)
# religion: Ancestor rites and domestic auspicious rituals as the main emphasis (shraddha/pinda
#   offerings via family, auspicious days, household purity observances) alongside general
#   deity worship

# structured_incidents:
# - event: 'Recurring pattern: As a small child she was often slapped or struck with
#     a thin switch for spilling grain or crying, and during tight seasons her mother
#     sometimes left her hungry while working in the fields, treating it as harsh discipline
#     rather than cruelty.'
#   reasoning: With multiple sibling deaths and the stresses of a smallholding household,
#     harsh discipline and neglect risk were real, but most children were not severely
#     abused in a way we’d label extreme/pathological.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 4–9
#   type: childhood_abuse
# - event: 'Recurring pattern: After marriage her husband periodically beat her with
#     his hands or a stick during arguments over food stores, visits to her natal village,
#     or perceived disobedience, typically in the courtyard or cattle-shed area and
#     followed by pressure from elders to keep it quiet.'
#   reasoning: Intimate-partner physical violence occurred at meaningful rates historically;
#     her very high agreeableness may reduce conflict escalation but does not eliminate
#     risk in a male-dominated household.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 16–31
#   type: domestic_violence
# - event: 'Sustained period: She spent weeks nursing a close family member—most likely
#     her husband—through a severe fever with diarrhea, preparing thin gruel, fetching
#     water, cleaning soiled bedding, and managing the household and animals while he
#     was too weak to work.'
#   reasoning: Joint households frequently relied on women for nursing the ill (children,
#     husband, in-laws), and high infectious burden makes a prolonged episode likely
#     at least once.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 29–30

Anandi was born on May 3, 1178, in a farming hamlet in the Awadh country of the middle Ganga plain. Revenue men came through for chiefs in the Gahadavala sphere centered on Kannauj and Banaras; village decisions ran through headmen, caste councils, and the men who controlled plough-oxen and seed. Her household kept its days with ancestor offerings, purity rules, and temple visits when there was grain to spare.

Her father, Jagan, held a modest plot and ploughed it with a pair of oxen he guarded carefully. Her mother, Sona, ground grain, cooked, and worked in the fields when weeds rose fast after the rains. Before Anandi’s birth, Sona had carried children who did not stay: Gauri, a daughter born in 1168, died in 1173 at five years old; Mahesh was born in 1171 and died the same day. When Anandi was little, those deaths lived in the courtyard in the way Sona watched for coughs and loose stools and in the way she kept a small corner of the house for ritual scraps—rice grains, a wick stub, a pinch of ash.

Two children survived long enough for Anandi to share chores with them. Hari, born in 1174, grew into a thin, quick-moving boy who drove cattle and ran messages to the edge of the market. Champa, born in 1176, stayed near Anandi and pulled her along. When they were small, Champa taught her how to keep lentils from spilling through the sieve and how to tuck cow-dung cakes into a neat stack that dried evenly.

From the time Anandi could carry a small pot, Sona put her to work. At four, she learned to stand near the grinding stone and keep away dogs while Sona worked the pestle. When Anandi cried from hunger or tiredness, Sona struck her with a thin switch cut from a branch and told her to be quiet. In the hottest months, when the fields demanded long days, Sona left her without food until mid-afternoon; the older children ate first, then the adults. Anandi learned to wait, then to eat quickly when her turn came—watery rice, salt, sometimes a bit of sour curd.

She avoided talk. When women gathered at the well, Champa traded gossip and small jokes, but Anandi stayed close to the rope and watched the water in the clay jar. She saved her words for the work that needed them: “Hold,” when the pot tipped; “Move,” when the calf lunged.

Kesar, Jagan’s mother, came from a nearby hamlet and died in 1190. Before she died, she pinched Anandi’s cheek hard and told her to keep household matters inside the household. After the funeral meal, Sona took Anandi to the family’s small ancestor corner. She lit a lamp with mustard oil, set a little rice and a few sesame seeds on a leaf, and spoke the names of the dead: Gauri, Mahesh. Anandi listened closely and repeated the names to herself as if doing so kept them in place.

In 1193, Hari died at nineteen after a fever that left him confused and shaking. Without him, Jagan had to hire help at peak times and owed favors he did not like owing. Champa took up more work, and Sona tightened her rules. Sona held Anandi by the shoulders and spoke of marriage without softness.

In 1194, when Anandi was sixteen, she married Deva. A year later, Champa died at nineteen. She had been healthy and then suddenly wasn't; her belly cramped, and she could not keep water. Anandi was now the only surviving child in her natal family.

Deva was a cultivator from a village within a day's walk. The marriage brought her into a patrilocal courtyard where Deva’s kin watched her hands and her mouth. She rose before dawn, swept the yard, smeared the floor with wet cow-dung, and set the morning fire. She learned where the grain was stored and who had the key to the pot of ghee. Her own small pleasures were quiet ones: warm millet flatbread eaten beside the stove before others woke, and sitting on the edge of the threshing floor at dusk, rubbing chaff from her palms and letting the evening coolness settle.

Deva worked the fields and expected obedience. The first time he beat her was in 1194 after she asked to visit her natal village for a day to see her mother. He hit her in the courtyard and then again by the cattle shed when she spoke back. His elder kinsman Biru told her afterward to keep her voice low and not pull trouble into the family. Anandi nodded, brought water, and set about cooking as if nothing had happened. She learned the pattern: a quarrel over grain stores, a comment from an elder, Deva’s hand or a stick, then an insistence that the matter stay inside the courtyard walls.

Her first child, Kamla, arrived in 1195. Anandi nursed her while grinding grain, shifting the child on her hip as she turned the stone. Kamla learned to toddle near the cattle and follow Anandi to the well. In 1199, Kamla died at four after days of diarrhea. Anandi washed the child, wrapped her, and watched the men carry her to the burning place. That night she placed a small mound of rice on a leaf near the ancestor corner, set a lamp beside it, and spoke the child’s name once in a low voice.

In 1197 she bore a daughter, Lila, who died the day she was born. The midwife Sukhdei cleaned the blood from the floor and told Anandi to drink warm water with salt. Anandi did as she was told and returned to work as soon as she could stand.

A son, Raghav, was born in 1198 and lived. Anandi's days filled with carrying him, feeding him, and keeping him from the cooking fire and the tethered ox. Another daughter, Saras, followed in 1200. She refused to short-measure when sharing seed with neighbors, even when Biru hinted that it would do no harm. Once, when a sickle went missing, she found it near the edge of the field and returned it at once rather than letting her household keep it. People asked her to hold small items—beads, a coin, a brass bangle—because she returned what was not hers.

More births came. Ganga, born in 1202, died immediately. Champa was born in 1204 and lived; Anandi named her for her dead sister and spoke that sister's name more often after. In 1206 she gave birth to a daughter she called Gauri, again after the lost child in her natal family, and that baby died the same day.

Between 1207 and 1209, Raghav grew into a strong youth and took on more plough work, and the household became clearly joint. When he reached marriageable age, a young wife came into the courtyard for him. Anandi now managed not only her own children but the new daughter-in-law's work. She taught the girl where the grinding stone sat level, how much water the stored grain could take before it spoiled, which neighbors returned borrowed tools and which did not. The girl moved slowly and sometimes left tasks half-done. Anandi corrected her without harshness, repeating instructions until the patterns held. She preferred predictable routines. When a wandering healer offered a new herb paste for children's coughs, she refused it and used the same warmed oil and steam method Sona had used.

Mohan, her youngest son, was born in 1208. That same year, word came that Jagan, her father, had died. Anandi's in-laws allowed her a brief visit to her natal village. She brought a small offering of rice and sesame, placed it at the ancestor corner in her childhood home, and spoke his name with the others Sona had taught her. Four years later, in 1212, Sona herself died. Again Anandi made the walk, again she placed offerings, and again she returned to her husband's household the same day.

In 1207, a wave of sickness had moved through the villages after the rains. The next year, when Anandi was thirty, Deva fell ill with fever and diarrhea that did not stop. For weeks she boiled water, made thin rice gruel, cleaned soiled bedding, and carried his waste away from the well path. Nanda, an older neighbor woman, helped her fetch extra water and warned her not to let the children drink from shallow puddles. Anandi slept in brief stretches and kept the household's animals fed and tethered. Deva recovered, but the days left her exhausted and tighter in her movements.

The beatings from Deva continued into her early thirties and ended only when Biru intervened after a public argument about grain stored for seed. Deva listened to Biru in ways he did not listen to Anandi. After that, Deva’s anger came out in hard words and withheld help rather than blows.

In late May of 1215, after a hot week, Anandi developed severe diarrhea. She drank water and vomited it back, then could not keep even thin gruel down. Nanda brought water boiled with salt and a little jaggery, and Sukhdei came and pressed her belly, muttering about heat and impurity. Anandi could not stand without swaying. She died on June 2, 1215, in the courtyard room where she slept with her children.

Her husband's family washed her body, wrapped it in cloth, and carried it to the burning place outside the village. After the cremation, Deva’s household set out a simple offering—rice, sesame, and water—for her at the ancestor corner.
