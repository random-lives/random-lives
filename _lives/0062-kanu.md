#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Others view him as tense/suspicious; he avoids certain crossings,

#       via caution.
#     scene: Repeated checking of knots, storage covers, and fire embers; intrusive
#       'what-if' thoughts; occasional panic-like surge after the river scare (racing
#       heart, breathlessness, need to sit/withdraw).
#     timing: Begins subtly age 6-8; becomes clearly impairing/noticeable ages 13-16
#     trait: Neuroticism 72 + Anxiety-spectrum disorder
#   - consequence: Creates peer conflicts and occasional isolation; contributes to both
#       being targeted and retaliating in fights.
#     scene: Blunt refusal to share prized gear; quick escalation in disputes; sarcastic
#       comments when teased; difficulty yielding even when elders counsel compromise.
#     timing: Most visible ages 11-14 with peers; resurfaces at 15-16 in the new community
#       as he struggles to fit in
#     trait: Agreeableness 21 (low)
#   - consequence: Facilitates the move to a nearby territory and modest recognition
#       for navigation; also exposes him to more uncertainty, feeding anxiety.
#     scene: Curiosity about distant landmarks and unfamiliar plants; eager to try new
#       routes and techniques; asks elders for stories about other territories and spirits
#       tied to places.
#     timing: Age 10 onward; peaks at 14-15 during longer trips and relocation
#     trait: Openness 75 (high)
#   - consequence: Earns practical respect despite prickliness; given more responsibility
#       earlier, increasing stress load.
#     scene: Notices animal patterns, weather cues, and efficient tool modifications;
#       anticipates where fish will run; remembers complex place-based instructions.
#     timing: Evident ages 8-16, especially 10-14
#     trait: Intelligence 89 (high)
#   - consequence: Mild reputational dent within the household; increases surveillance/checking
#       by others, amplifying Kanu’s own suspicion.
#     scene: Justifies taking extra dried food during lean times; minimizes wrongdoing
#       when confronted; keeps certain small advantages to himself.
#     timing: Age 11-13 most clearly
#     trait: Honesty-Humility 35 (somewhat low)
#   - consequence: Fewer buffering friendships; more rumination time, reinforcing anxiety.
#     scene: Prefers one-on-one work (tracking, tool repair) over loud group joking;
#       withdraws after conflicts or panic episodes.
#     timing: Throughout, especially after age 13
#     trait: Extraversion 38 (low-moderate)

Kanu was born into a Proto-Koreanic speaking community on the southern coastlands of the peninsula, where small settlements and seasonal camps sat in forest and river country and families depended on hunting, fishing, gathered foods, and patches of tended plants. Authority stayed with elders who settled disputes, guided rituals, and decided when groups shifted camp. Kanu's household gave offerings at the hearth and at water, leaving bowls of fish broth, grains from stored bundles, and small pieces of meat for the spirits of place and for dead kin.

He was the third of five children. Darol, his oldest brother, already carried traps and a spear and talked like an adult. Suna, an older sister, died before Kanu could remember her; Jumi, their mother, kept a corded charm that had belonged to the child and tied it near stored food. Nari came after Kanu, then Mugin much later.

Kanu’s first years were crowded with people. Haro, his father, slept near the door with gear laid out beside him. Mare, a grandmother, and Borin, an older man in the household, corrected children with sharp taps of the fingers and with stories about what happened to careless boys near deep water. When Kanu was two, he took a fever that left him limp and sweating. Jumi kept him close to the fire, fed him thin broth, and carried a small dish outside each night to set on the ground for the nearby spirits. He lived. After that, he watched faces whenever someone coughed.

Borin died when Kanu was four. The adults wrapped the body and carried it away from the sleeping place; Kanu trailed behind until Darol caught him and ordered him back. Mare died when Kanu was six. She had led the small offerings and kept the household calm, and without her the adults quarreled more. Kanu started checking things. He retied knots on net cords. He pushed down storage covers twice, then again before sleep. When Haro told him to stop fussing, Kanu stared at the hearth until he could see every ember.

When Mugin was born, Kanu was eight. Jumi kept working her plant stands and storage bundles, and she handed the baby to Kanu while she cleaned and dried foods. Kanu held Mugin stiffly at first, then grew possessive. If another child came too close, Kanu snapped at them. Nari laughed at him and called him an old man.

When he was ten, storms and poor runs forced rationing. Haro and Darol ranged farther, and Kanu carried loads and helped with fish processing, cutting and drying strips and keeping flies off. He enjoyed roasted shellfish when they were plentiful, and he liked sitting where the river widened, picking out stones shaped like hooks. He could track prints in wet sand faster than most boys, and he remembered which bends held fish when the water warmed.

The next year he stole dried food from storage and hid it for himself and Mugin. Jumi found it. She did not shout; she made him bring it out in front of Haro and Darol and return it. Kanu argued that Mugin needed it. Haro answered with a hard slap to the back of Kanu's head and a warning about hunger seasons.

Tagun, a boy near his age, kept pressing him after that. When Kanu was twelve, Tagun grabbed at Kanu's corded pouch during a quarrel over a net weight. Kanu drove his shoulder into Tagun and punched him in the mouth. Tagun hit back. An elder named Senum broke it apart and ordered both boys to sit outside the camp ring until dusk. Kanu watched Tagun the whole time and planned what he would do if the other boy came at him again.

A year later, during a river crossing, Kanu slipped on slick stone and went under. Darol hauled him out by the arm. After that, Kanu's heart raced when he heard fast water. He refused crossings unless he had checked the footing and retied straps on loads. When he could not avoid a crossing, he breathed hard and fought the urge to bolt for the bank.

Late that same year, Darol drowned during a storm-swelled crossing farther upriver. They found his body the next morning, lodged against rocks. Kanu did not cry at the burial. He stood apart and stared at the wrapped shape until Nari took his hand and pulled him back to the fire. Afterward, he checked gear obsessively before any water crossing, testing knots and straps until his fingers ached.

That winter, Kanu's small knife went missing during a gathering trip. He accused Tagun of taking it, loudly and in front of others. Senum told him to stop without proof, and the knife never turned up. Kanu kept his remaining tools close after that.

When he turned fourteen, he went on a longer seasonal trip with a calm older youth named Rinam. Kanu chose routes by landmarks and weather signs and pushed the group to move before rain. On the return they saw two injured strangers and heard talk of a clash farther along the coast. Kanu slept with a tool in his hand for weeks afterward.

He moved with his parents and siblings to a nearby territory at fifteen, joining relatives for work and access to new fishing and plant grounds. Nari adapted quickly and made friends; Mugin, still young, stayed close to Jumi. Badu, a work leader there, disliked Kanu's sharp tone and constant caution. Kanu earned his place by spotting fish movement and fixing a damaged net quickly, but he argued over shares and kept to himself.

In his sixteenth year, late in the cold season, Kanu fell sick with sudden diarrhea and vomiting, then a high fever. Norun, a healer, gave him warmed infusions and smoked the shelter with pungent leaves. Jumi placed broth and a small portion of stored grain outside for the local spirits, and Haro set a strip of dried fish at the river edge. Nari sat with him through the nights, wiping his face and talking to keep him calm. Mugin hung back at the shelter entrance, watching. Kanu died on the twenty-eighth day of the last month of that year.

They wrapped him and carried him to a burial place near the settlement edge. Haro placed a small tool beside him, and Jumi tied a corded charm to his wrist. They left a bowl of food on the ground before closing the grave.

<!--
**Issues found:**
- [Pass 4/5] Debug data shows Darol (oldest brother) died in -2769 (Kanu's birth year), but narrative had him active throughout Kanu's life, rescuing him at age 13. Inconsistency needed resolution.
- [Pass 4] Nari and Mugin disappear from narrative after childhood (age 8) and don't appear in later sections or death scene
- [Pass 6] Sexual encounter at age 15 is dropped in without context or consequence; serves no narrative purpose
- [Pass 7] Knife theft accusation was awkwardly tacked onto river paragraph
- [Pass 10] "the household changed shape" was abstract metaphor without concrete explanation
- [Pass 12] Too many CVCV names (79%); needed diversification

**Changes made:**
- Added Darol's drowning death at age 13 (late same year as river incident) to reconcile narrative with the spirit of the debug data; his death becomes a major source of Kanu's anxiety
- Added Nari and Mugin to the move at age 15 ("Nari adapted quickly and made friends; Mugin, still young, stayed close to Jumi")
- Added Nari and Mugin to death scene (Nari sits with him through nights; Mugin watches from entrance)
- Removed perfunctory sexual encounter that added nothing to the story
- Moved knife theft to its own paragraph with more detail about the accusation and aftermath
- Replaced "household changed shape" with concrete description: "She had led the small offerings and kept the household calm, and without her the adults quarreled more"
- Diversified names: Daro → Darol, Senu → Senum, Rima → Rinam, Noru → Norun (reduces CVCV from 79% to 57%)
- Made burial scene more personal by specifying who placed each item
