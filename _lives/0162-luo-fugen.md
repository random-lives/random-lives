#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-7
#     key_events:
#     - Born into a co-resident joint household with uncle’s branch; learns early temple
#       and ancestor-offering routines from grandmother (1808–1815).
#     - 'Household work begins young: gathering brushwood, watching younger cousins;
#       father/elders criticize his distractibility and unfinished tasks (1813–1815).'
#     - Grandfather dies; first clear memory of funeral rites and lineage obligations
#       (1820, age 12—late childhood but anchors early sense of death/ritual).
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 8-19
#     key_events:
#     - Brief village schooling enough to recognize common characters; quits early,
#       preferring talk and roaming, then returns to farm tasks (c. 1816–1820).
#     - Older brother Changfa dies at 19; Fugen is pulled into adult labor and mourning
#       duties (1822, age 14).
#     - Marriage negotiations begin as he reaches late teens; family seeks a steady
#       wife to stabilize him (1824–1827).
#     phase: Later childhood & adolescence
#   - age_range: 20-32
#     key_events:
#     - Marries He Aizhen; first children born; Fugen alternates between farming and
#       hill-side wood/charcoal work to meet rent (1827–1836).
#     - Eldest brother Changshun dies; household authority shifts, and partition pressures
#       rise between branches (1834–1836).
#     - Bad harvest year and rent stress push greater reliance on charcoal/woodcutting
#       and small borrowing (likely early 1830s, e.g., 1831–1833).
#     phase: Early adult life (marriage, young children, household strain)
#   - age_range: 33-48
#     key_events:
#     - Becomes primary support for aging parents; daily care duties intensify and limit
#       his ability to take distant work (1838–1844).
#     - 'Major depressive episode: weeks to months of slowed movement, withdrawal from
#       talkativeness, sleep/appetite disruption, feelings of uselessness amid rent
#       pressure and deaths (centered 1840–1842).'
#     - Wife’s prolonged winter lung illness; he reduces hill work, manages cooking/fire,
#       seeks herbs and ritual help (1849–1851).
#     phase: Midlife (caregiving, depression, unrest)
#   - age_range: 49-54

#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 1799

#     death_age: 19
#     death_year: 1822
#     name: Luo Changfa
#     narrative_role: Third brother close enough in age to be an early companion; his

#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1806
#     death_age: 64
#     death_year: 1870
#     name: Luo Yulan
#     narrative_role: Older sister; married out to a nearby village but remained emotionally
#       close, visiting at New Year and funerals. She is a practical voice who scolds
#       Fugen’s slackness yet defends his basic decency.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds a reputation as 'straight' but also costs him small advantages;
#       landlords/elders trust him for errands and witness roles, increasing obligations.
#     scene: At a market weighing-stone dispute, he insists on using the landlord’s
#       scale and returns an overpaid copper-string even when nobody would know; later
#       he refuses to cut timber from a boundary grove despite hunger.
#     timing: Ages 25–35 (1833–1843)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (very high)
#   - consequence: Chronic household friction; pushes him toward flexible hill work
#       rather than roles requiring strict scheduling; contributes to financial squeezes.
#     scene: He forgets agreed workdays, leaves charcoal pits unattended, and starts
#       tasks enthusiastically but drifts into chatting; wife and elder brother repeatedly
#       have to finish or cover for him.
#     timing: Visible from adolescence; peaks in early adulthood (1818–1838)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (very low)
#   - consequence: Expands the household’s informal network (useful for borrowing, hiring,
#       ritual help) but also distracts from steady labor and annoys stricter kin.
#     scene: He thrives at temple fairs and market days, knows many people by nickname,
#       and is often the one sent to negotiate small matters—sometimes talking too long
#       and returning late.
#     timing: Late teens through midlife (1825–1855)
#     trait: Extraversion (high)
#   - consequence: Stability and social acceptance; slower adaptation during market
#       disruptions and unrest.
#     scene: He prefers customary methods—old seed varieties, familiar offerings, distrust
#       of novel sect talk—choosing 'what our elders do' even when sons argue for changes.
#     timing: Adulthood (1830s–1860s)
#     trait: Low Openness (low)
#   - consequence: Limits upward mobility and increases dependence on kin for paperwork;
#       increases vulnerability to bad bargains (mitigated by his honesty and community
#       reputation).
#     scene: He can recognize common characters and tally small sums but struggles with
#       contracts and longer accounts; he relies on wife/son for precise calculations
#       and legal wording.
#     timing: Young adulthood onward (1827–1862)
#     trait: Intelligence (below average)
#   - consequence: Temporary drop in earnings and greater debt risk; increases wife’s
#       burden; later makes him more fearful of 'bad years' and more reliant on routine.
#     scene: After compounded stress (parental decline, rent pressure, and bereavement),
#       he becomes unusually silent and slow, neglects washing and meals, avoids the
#       hill path, and expresses hopelessness; family compensates and seeks both practical
#       rest and ritual comfort.
#     timing: Primary episode ages 32–34 (1840–1842), with possible shorter dips later
#     trait: Major depressive disorder (at least one significant episode)
# number_of_children: '6'
# number_of_siblings: '4'
# occupation: Charcoal/woodcutting/mining-adjacent labor in hills (combined with some
#   farming)
# religion: 'Household & lineage rites: ancestor tablets/grave offerings; incense/paper;
#   local temple worship (Tudi/Mazu/Guandi etc.) as needed'

# - M

# structured_incidents:
# - event: His wife developed a long winter cough with fever and weakness—likely a lingering
#     lung illness—which left her unable to spin, cook regularly, or help in the fields;
#     he cut back on hill work to fetch herbs, keep the hearth going, and rely on his
#     daughter-in-law for daily meals while arranging a local ritual offering for recovery.
#   reasoning: In a multi-generational rural household with high infectious disease
#     and injury rates, it was common to spend months caring for a sick spouse, child,
#     or sibling; his stem-family setting makes this plausible even without social prominence.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 41–43 (1849–1851), sustained period with intermittent relapses
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: As the son who remained in the stem household, he and his wife became the
#     primary support for his aging father and mother (or widowed mother), providing
#     rice and firewood and helping with washing, toileting, and escorting them to ancestral
#     graves and the local temple during festivals as their legs weakened.
#   reasoning: As a married man who ended in a stem household, he was a likely candidate
#     to shoulder responsibility for one or more aging parents/in-laws when they survived
#     into his adulthood, consistent with patrilocal norms.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 30–36 (1838–1844), sustained period until the last parent died

Luo Fugen was born on June 15, 1808, in the hills and rice valleys of western Jiangxi, under the Qing dynasty. His family spoke Gan speech at home and kept the ordinary routines of a Han lineage: incense at the household altar, paper money burned at New Year, bowls of rice and meat set out for ancestors, and trips to the Earth God shrine at the edge of the fields when planting began.

He came into a crowded joint household. His father, Luo Shunxing, rented most of their land and paid the rent in grain and strings of cash. His mother, Wang Shi, managed the stove, the jars of pickled vegetables, and the spinning basket. An uncle, Luo Changde, lived under the same roof with his own wife and children, and the old people still had authority in the room where the tablets were kept. Fugen grew up hearing older voices decide who would weed which plot, who would haul bundles from the hills, and what could be sold at the market.

The birth order sat on him from the start. The eldest brother, Luo Changshun, was already a working young man by the time Fugen could walk. A second brother, Luo Changgui, had died at birth years before; no one spoke of him unless the women were washing clothes by the stream and the talk turned to hard pregnancies. The brother closest to him in age, Luo Changfa, treated him like a tagalong. Their sister, Luo Yulan, carried water with the women and slipped Fugen hot sweet potato when he hovered at the door.

As a boy he could not keep his attention on one chore. He would be sent to gather brushwood and come back late because he had stopped to watch a man set snares for rabbits or to talk at the threshing ground. When his grandmother Liu Shi was alive she smoothed quarrels by putting him to work beside her—sorting beans, twisting rope, holding the incense sticks steady at the altar—tasks small enough that he finished them. His grandfather Luo Dechang died in 1820, and the household held the funeral in the old style: white cloth on the doorway, hired wailing, a Daoist ritual specialist chanting, and paper effigies burned outside. Fugen learned the sequence by being ordered to run messages and carry water, then kneel until his legs shook.

He went to a village school for a short spell. The teacher made him copy characters until his wrist cramped. Fugen learned to recognize common ones and to read a few simple lines on a printed almanac, but he quit before he could write more than his name and a couple of set phrases. He did better talking than studying. He liked to linger at market stalls, where he could joke with porters and listen to traveling storytellers, and he remembered faces and nicknames more easily than sums. His grandmother Liu Shi died in 1827, leaving the household without her steady hand at small tasks.

In 1822 his brother Changfa died at nineteen. A fever took him quickly. Fugen helped wash the body, tied the cloth bands, and carried the mourners’ bowls of plain rice. After that his father watched him harder. He was fourteen and suddenly there was no buffer between him and adult labor.

At nineteen, in 1827, he married He Aizhen from a nearby hamlet. The match had been arranged through her elder brother, He Shunbao, who liked that Fugen was straightforward and did not haggle over small matters. On the morning she arrived, Aizhen’s hair was neat, her bundle small, and she did not look away when his mother inspected her hands. She took over a corner of the stove area and learned the habits of the Luo women without complaint. Fugen, proud to be a married man, spent that autumn telling jokes at the wine stall after market day until his father hauled him home by the sleeve.

Their first child, Luo Jinzhi, arrived in 1828, a daughter. Fugen held the baby awkwardly and then walked to the family altar to light incense, placing a small bowl of rice and a sliver of pork before the tablets. In 1830 Aizhen delivered another daughter, Luo Xiaomei, who died the same day. Aizhen lay silent afterward, and Fugen stopped going to the wine stall for a time. The next daughter, Luo Yunhua, was born in 1832, with a strong cry and a fist that grabbed hair. Fugen laughed at that and told neighbors she would fight boys.

Money stayed tight. Their rented plots produced rice, but the rent and taxes left little. Fugen began taking more hill work. He cut wood and helped tend charcoal pits under a kiln boss named Zeng Youtang, who advanced rice on credit when a family needed it. Fugen liked the banter of the crews and the simple pride of a well-made stack of billets, but he also left tasks half done—failing to bank a pit properly, arriving late to a day agreed in advance. Zeng cursed him for it and then took him back because Fugen did not steal and did not lie about what he had done.

The household changed sharply in 1834 when Changshun died at thirty-eight. With the eldest brother gone, arguments over grain bins and labor sharpened between branches. Fugen’s uncle Changde pressed for a clear division, and Shunxing resisted until the daily friction wore him down. Fugen wanted peace and talked too much at the wrong moments, promising different things to different ears and then forgetting exactly what he had said.

His first son, Luo Shoutian, was born in 1835, and the next, Luo Shouliang, in 1838. By then the silver–copper exchange swung badly and taxes and surcharges bit harder even this far from the coast. Rent collectors came with tighter deadlines. Shunxing’s shoulders rounded and his breath shortened. In 1838, with his parents’ legs weaker, the care of them settled onto Fugen and Aizhen. He hauled firewood closer to the house, carried wash water, and escorted his father to the Earth God shrine on festival days. When his mother’s hands shook too much to hold chopsticks steady, Fugen fed her by spoon. He did not do it neatly, but he did it without resentment, and he did not complain that the work stole time from charcoal money.

His mother died in 1841. After the burial he stopped speaking much. He sat on the low stool by the door and stared at the yard, leaving his bowl half eaten. When neighbors called, he answered without looking up. He did not go to the hills for weeks. Aizhen managed the household with Shoutian and Shouliang, and He Shunbao came once with dried herbs and spoke softly to him. That winter Fugen slept in the daytime and lay awake at night. He muttered that he was useless and that the rent would crush them. When the spring planting demanded movement, his body obeyed again, slowly at first, then with a dull steadiness. His father died in 1844, and the funeral costs pushed them into small debts that took years to settle.

The youngest son, Luo Shouhe, was born in 1842 while the household was still in mourning and strain. Fugen held the baby and then, in the old habit, went straight to the tablets. He placed incense, bowed, and counted out coins to buy paper money for burning. He refused offers to shave the ritual costs by cutting corners. Once, when a landlord’s agent accidentally handed him too many coins after a rent payment, Fugen walked back to return them, even though his sons told him to keep quiet.

In 1849 Aizhen fell into a long winter illness. She coughed until her ribs showed, ran fever, and could not stand long at the stove. Fugen cut back his hill work and learned to keep the hearth going: boiling rice thin, stirring millet gruel, heating water for washing. Shoutian had married by then, and his wife Deng Shi cooked many of the meals, while Fugen fetched herbs and carried messages to the Daoist specialist Qiu for an offering to Guandi and the local Earth God. Aizhen improved, relapsed, and improved again through 1851, and Fugen’s hands became practiced at small domestic tasks that men usually left to women.

The 1850s brought wider disorder. Roads became less safe, and men gathered to talk about militia and bandits and the Taiping armies moving through parts of Jiangxi. Market days thinned. Zeng Youtang’s crews worked closer to home, and sometimes charcoal went unsold. Fugen listened more than he talked when strangers passed through. He did not take up new teachings or join secret groups. He kept to incense and ancestors, bowls of rice and cups of tea before the tablets, and paper burned at the tombs.

Losses kept coming. Yunhua died in 1856 at twenty-four, after a sudden illness that left the household scrambling for funeral cloth and ritual fees. The same year, his uncle Changde died, closing a chapter of old joint-household disputes and leaving Fugen’s branch more clearly on its own. Jinzhi, married out, returned less often as her own household grew strained. She died in 1861 at thirty-three, and Fugen’s mood darkened again, though he still rose each morning to sweep the yard and light incense.

In the summer of 1862 he caught a hard respiratory sickness. He insisted on sitting up and tried to drink thin rice water between bouts of coughing. He died on July 20, 1862, at fifty-four, in the stem household with Aizhen and Shoutian’s family under the same roof.

They washed his body, dressed him in clean clothes, and placed him in a coffin in the main room. Incense smoked before the tablets, paper money burned outside, and the family carried him to burial ground near the village graves, setting food offerings and wine at the mound.
