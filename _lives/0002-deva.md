#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Elders sometimes value his observations, but peers also see him as
#       'odd' and not focused on the immediate task.
#     scene: As a teen he lingers to watch how smoke and wind shift a burn line, experimenting
#       with small changes and talking about which plants return after fire.
#     timing: Ages 12-16
#     trait: High Openness (92)
#   - consequence: Creates conflict with father and later spouse; contributes to slightly
#       lowered status and vulnerability during poor-monsoon years.
#     scene: He forgets to repair a field edge or delays weeding until it is urgent,
#       then tries to catch up in bursts, making the household’s harvest less reliable.
#     timing: Ages 15-29 (recurring pattern)
#     trait: Very low Conscientiousness (12)
#   - consequence: Fewer allies during land/plot tensions; contributes to him being
#       an easier target during the age-23 assault.
#     scene: He avoids communal loud gatherings, speaks little in councils, and lets
#       others negotiate disputes until matters spill over.
#     timing: Ages 10-29
#     trait: Very low Extraversion (11)
#   - consequence: More avoidance and irritability; strains marriage; reinforces reliance
#       on propitiation/healing rituals.
#     scene: During monsoon nights he catastrophizes about fever and crop failure, sleeps
#       poorly, and interprets ordinary aches as signs of coming sickness.
#     timing: Ages 7-29 (strongest during illness years 19-28)
#     trait: Very high Neuroticism (90)
#   - consequence: Allows him to contribute useful ideas and occasional successes, partially
#       offsetting his weak reliability.
#     scene: He quickly learns routes, landmarks, and seasonal cues, and can plan a
#       more efficient day’s work—when he follows through.

#     trait: Above-average Intelligence (63)
# number_of_children: '2'

# occupation: Subsistence cultivator (shifting/small-field farming; primary identity
#   as farmer)
# religion: 'Local Adivasi folk religion: ancestor/spirits + village/forest deities;
#   animal/food/liquor offerings; healing/divination/possession rituals led by a local

# sibling_sexes:
# - F
# - F
# - M
# structured_incidents:
# - event: During the monsoon planting season, after a dispute over access to a forest-edge
#     plot and who had rights to clear and burn a patch, he was set upon by men from
#     a neighboring hamlet and beaten with sticks and fists, leaving him bruised and
#     sore for days.
#   reasoning: Fights, beatings, and inter-household disputes were common sources of
#     injury for young men; his marginal adult standing and emotional volatility increase
#     chances of being targeted or drawn into conflict.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 23 (early monsoon season)
#   type: physical_assault
# - event: Across several rainy seasons he suffered recurrent bouts of fever with chills
#     and profound weakness—likely malaria from mosquito-heavy lowland and streamside
#     work—sometimes keeping him from the fields for a week or more and leaving him
#     thin and easily exhausted between episodes.
#   reasoning: Chronic or recurring conditions (malaria relapses, chronic gastrointestinal
#     issues, respiratory problems, lingering infections) were common, but many did
#     not cause long-term limitation before age 29.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Ages 19–28 (recurrent, worst during monsoons)
#   type: chronic_illness

Deva was born on December 26, 975, in the forested hills east of the coastal plain where the Western Ghats rose into moist deciduous country. Chiefs and kings in the wider region changed names and banners, but in his hamlet the order of life came through headmen and intermediaries who carried demands for grain, labor, and forest goods from the settled edges. Deva’s people spoke a Bhil-related Western Indo-Aryan tongue and kept their own rites: offerings at stones under trees, meals shared with ancestors, and healing work done through herbs, drumming, and trance when sickness returned with the rains.

He arrived as the fourth child, after death had already shaped the household. His sister Moti died at three before he could remember her; the story was fixed in the family as a monsoon illness that took her quickly. His brother Balu lived only into 976, small and feverish. Their eldest sister Rupa, born in 971, grew up with the knowledge that she had outlasted the others. When Deva was a toddler she carried him on her hip as she fetched water and firewood, scolding him sharply when he grabbed at her hair, then laughing when he copied her words in his soft child voice.

The household was an extended one, centered on Deva’s father Khema and his parents, Dhola and Hira. Khema cleared patches at the forest edge and burned them at the right time, working with other men to keep fire from running into the wrong grove. He expected a son to watch, to learn, then to do. Deva watched but did not keep his eyes where Khema wanted them. He followed ants across the ash, pulled apart seed pods, and asked why one tree leaf stayed green longer than another. When Khema sent him to bring a stone adze or a coil of rope, Deva brought the wrong one and tried to talk his way out of it. Hira stepped between them more than once. She had a hard manner but she kept her hand light on Deva’s shoulders and fed him first when there was thin porridge.

At five he began to go with the adults to the fields and the streams. Monsoon seasons came heavy. People spoke about fever as if it traveled in the air over low water. When someone in the hamlet shook with chills, Hira set out a small leaf plate with rice, salt, and a splash of liquor at the base of a tree near the edge of the clearing. She named ancestors in a low voice, then the local spirit of the place, and brushed Deva’s forehead with neem leaves. Deva watched every motion and later repeated it behind the house, with pebbles and a torn leaf, arranging and rearranging until Rupa found him and teased him for “feeding stones.”

The 980s brought more outsiders along the paths. Men like Kalu, an intermediary with connections to the settled side, came to speak with Dhola and Khema about bamboo, timber, and bundles of leaves. Sometimes they asked for hands to carry loads or to clear a path. Deva kept away from the talk; he sat at the edge of the group and picked at a strip of bark, listening. Dhola noticed this and, when he was in a patient mood, pulled Deva close and pointed out how boundaries worked—where one hamlet’s clearing ended, where another’s began, and which trees were treated as markers. Deva learned quickly when he cared to.

Dhola died in 989. The funeral brought relatives from nearby hamlets; there was rice beer and meat, and the elders spoke the lineage names over the body. Afterward Khema spoke more and listened less. Deva felt the change. He avoided the loud evening gatherings and took paths into the forest to sit alone on a flat rock above a stream. He liked the clean feeling of early morning, when smoke from cooking fires rose straight and the ground still held night coolness. If he had a small pleasure, it was roasted millet cakes eaten with a smear of salt and crushed chilies, still hot from the hearth. He also liked stories with trickster turns, and he laughed quietly when Rupa described a man from another hamlet who bragged about his hunt and returned with nothing but a scuffed knee.

Khema pushed him into heavier work by his mid-teens: cutting, clearing, carrying, guarding burn lines. Deva could plan a route through thick growth and return faster than older boys, and he remembered where certain tubers grew after a fire. He also left tasks half-done. He forgot to mend an edge fence and goats got in. He delayed weeding until the field looked rough, then worked in frantic bursts, sweating and irritated when his hands cramped. Khema shouted at him, and Deva answered back in a quick voice, then fell silent for days, moving through the house with his head lowered and his jaw tight.

At nineteen, in the monsoon of 994, Deva’s first serious fevers came. He shook hard enough that Hira and Rupa had to hold him to keep him from sliding off the sleeping mat. After the sweating broke, he stood up thin and unsteady and tried to go out anyway, and Khema stopped him by grabbing his arm. The fevers returned the next rains, and the next. Between episodes he worked, but he tired sooner than other men. He grew wary of streamside tasks and then did them anyway, because the fields needed water and the forest edge needed tending. A healer named Jiva was called more than once. Jiva sang to the drum and used smoke from burning leaves; he marked Deva’s skin with ash and spoke the names of spirits that lived at crossings and water.

Hira died in 995. Deva had leaned on her sharp comfort more than he admitted. After her death he became faster to anger and faster to fear. He lay awake during heavy rains, listening for the sound of wind and water, counting his breath, then getting up to check the roof lashings even when nothing had shifted.

He married Kanta in 996. She came from a nearby hamlet and arrived with a small bundle of household things and a steady way of watching people before she spoke. Khema helped Deva secure a small plot near the forest edge, and the new couple set up a separate hearth. Deva liked the privacy at first. He could sit outside after supper and listen to insects and the distant calls of men crossing a stream. Kanta wanted clear routines—grain stored properly, tools kept in one place, weeds pulled before they went to seed. She confronted him when he drifted. Deva answered with excuses and then with silence. They still worked together, and when his fevers hit, she brewed bitter decoctions and kept the child away from his sweat-soaked bedding.

Early in the monsoon of 998, after their daughter Lakhya was born, Deva began pushing harder on the boundary of his patch. Another hamlet’s men claimed that his clearing line had crept. Deva argued, uneasy and stubborn, and did not gather allies for the dispute. In the first weeks of rains he walked to the contested edge and was met by a group led by Nathu. They hit him with sticks and fists, driving him down into wet leaf litter. Deva crawled back with bruised ribs and swelling on one cheek. Kanta cleaned him and said little, but her face stayed hard for days. Deva avoided the path near Nathu’s hamlet afterward, taking longer routes through denser growth.

He loved Lakhya in short, intense ways. He held her on his forearm and pointed out birds and tracks in damp soil, speaking softly. When she cried at night he sometimes snapped, then took her outside and walked until she quieted. He did not like crowds, but he took her to a small shrine spot under a tree near the clearing, where stones marked the place of offerings. He set down rice and a few flowers, then poured a thin line of liquor onto the ground, naming his grandfather and grandmother and the spirit of the grove.

The fevers kept returning each monsoon. They left him thin and easily exhausted, and Kanta began to treat their household as if it might stand without him. In 1001 Rupa died at thirty, and the loss cut away a thread that had held him to childhood. He did not speak much at her rites; he sat apart, rubbing his hands together and staring at the ground.

Their son Raghu was born in 1004 and died the same day. Deva and Kanta carried small offerings—grain, salt, and liquor—to the old place under the tree and asked for protection. Deva grew jumpy afterward, quick to imagine signs in minor mishaps: a cracked pot, a sudden gust, a bird call at the wrong time. He tried to work harder, then collapsed into irritability when his strength failed.

In July of 1005 the rains were strong. Deva went out to cut and drag a long bamboo pole from a wet slope above a stream, intending to use it for repairs. The ground was slick. His foot slid, and he fell hard against a cut stump and stones. He made it back to the house, bleeding and shaking. Infection followed quickly in the heat and damp. He died on July 24 at twenty-nine.

Kanta and his kin washed his body and laid it out near the clearing. They placed rice and a small cup of liquor beside him and spoke ancestor names before carrying him to a cremation spot used by the hamlet, where the fire was fed with dry wood brought down from higher ground.
