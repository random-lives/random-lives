#       run.'
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: She is seen as 'steady' and reliable rather than dreamy; adults trust
#       her with routines but she is less drawn to experimentation or unusual roles.
#     scene: When traders describe distant places or new rituals, Tama shows polite
#       disinterest and returns to concrete questions (prices, water, who is kin to
#       whom), preferring known routes and familiar tasks.
#     timing: ages 7-14, especially at market stops
#     trait: Low Openness (7th percentile)
#   - consequence: Earns praise and increases her desirability as a future wife; also
#       makes her a target for extra workload when adults are stressed.
#     scene: During camp moves she pre-packs predictable bundles, checks straps, and
#       re-counts small items; she notices missing containers and insists on fetching
#       them even when others rush.
#     timing: ages 6-14 (strongest after age 9)
#     trait: High Conscientiousness (79th percentile)
#   - consequence: Builds broad goodwill and information access; occasionally draws
#       reprimands for being 'too forward' with strangers or older boys/men.
#     scene: She talks easily with visiting kin and asks direct questions at wells/markets,
#       acting as a social bridge between her mother’s tent and others; she leads younger
#       children in songs while walking.
#     timing: ages 5-14
#     trait: High Extraversion (78th percentile)
#   - consequence: Helps her function under hardship; may be read by some adults as
#       stubbornness or lack of shame, requiring careful social guidance from her mother/sister.
#     scene: In the lean season she stays outwardly calm, focuses on tasks, and rarely
#       panics; after harsh scolding she recovers quickly and returns to work.
#     timing: ages 10-14
#     trait: Low Neuroticism (21st percentile)
#   - consequence: Creates minor conflicts with co-wife children; forces her to learn
#       reputation management and when to yield to keep peace.
#     scene: She occasionally skims small advantages—keeping a better bead, taking a
#       slightly larger share for her mother’s pot, or shading the truth about who broke
#       a container—especially when resources are tight.
#     timing: ages 8-14 (peaks during crisis at 10-11)
#     trait: Low Honesty-Humility (22nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Keeps her in practical domestic roles rather than any specialized
#       religious schooling; increases reliance on siblings for complex negotiations.
#     scene: She learns best by imitation and repetition; struggles with abstract bargaining
#       math but excels at remembered routines (routes, packing order, which kin to
#       greet first).
#     timing: ages 6-14
#     trait: Lower Intelligence (27th percentile) without disorder
# number_of_children: '0'
# number_of_siblings: '9'
# occupation: Household/domestic labor (childcare, cooking, water/fuel collection, camp
#   setup/moving) as primary work
# religion: 'Mixed household practice: local spirit/ancestor rites + protective charms/amulets
#   + some Islamic elements (invocations, occasional prayer/feast participation, respect
#   for Muslim holy specialists)'

Tama was born on March 8, 1376, in the dry grasslands of the Sahel east of Lake Chad, where the influence of Kanem reached outward along wells and trade paths. Her people spoke a Tebu tongue at home and used some Kanembu words when dealing with traders. In her father Koday’s camp, prayers and protections mixed: a leather pouch with verses sewn inside hung on a cord at a child’s neck, and smoke from burned plants drifted through the tent after a birth.

Ayu, her mother, had already buried several infants. She tied an amulet to Tama’s waist cord and rubbed her with fat and ash. When Tama was small, Ayu kept her close, even as the camp shifted between water points. Koday had another wife, Hannat, and the household lived as a cluster of tents that moved together. Ayu’s own tent formed its own corner of that cluster, with its own cooking pot and children.

Tama grew tall early and stood out among the girls who carried water. She spoke readily and made herself part of adult talk, lingering at the edge of gatherings where men unloaded salt or where women compared grain measures. Her older sister Senay pulled her back by the wrist when she leaned in too far. Senay, seventeen years older, had watched most of her siblings die; she moved through the camp with the quiet authority of a first surviving daughter and set chores without raising her voice. Kuma, their older brother, teased Tama by calling her "market tongue" when she repeated a Kanembu greeting with the wrong rhythm. There was also Sadi, three years younger than Tama, who toddled behind them and grabbed at tent ropes.

In 1380, when Tama was four, her brother Birko died at fourteen during a fever season. The adults washed him, wrapped him, and moved camp soon after. For Tama, the memory stayed as practical things: the sound of straps pulled tight, the pot packed with cloth so it wouldn’t crack, Ayu’s face set while she kept the small children quiet.

By seven, Tama could pack her mother's load without being told. She rolled sleeping mats tight, kept the gourd stoppers together, and counted them again before the donkeys were loaded. She liked the early morning work, when the air was cooler and the older women were still drowsy enough to laugh. A girl her age, Tenoy, often walked with her on water trips. They traded small jokes—who had stepped in dung, who had spilled milk—then argued over whose turn it was to hold the rope. Tama sometimes kept the better bead from a shared string or took the thicker piece of dried curd for Ayu's bowl. When Hannat's daughters noticed, Tama offered something small in return before the complaint could reach the adults.

Koday’s trade kept the camp connected to the larger road-world. At certain market stops he swapped a goat for grain, or salt for cloth, and he brought news of trouble along routes—bandits, quarrels at wells, a caravan that turned back. Tama listened and remembered the concrete parts: which well had brackish water, which group demanded a gift to pass. She ignored the stories about far places beyond the desert; she wanted to know who stood where and what it cost.

The hard year came in 1386. Rains failed and pasture broke early. Their small stock thinned and milk fell away. Through the long lean months, Ayu's tent stripped itself down. A copper ornament went first, then a better hide. At a market stop, Koday took grain on unfavorable terms, and the bitterness showed in every portion. Hannat and Ayu snapped at each other over firewood and over which children had eaten first. Senay, now in her late twenties and long married to a man in a nearby camp, sent word offering to take Sadi until the worst passed; Ayu refused. Tama kept Sadi quiet by giving her a strip of leather to chew and telling her to watch for lizards in the sand. Kuma brought back a sick goat from grazing and spent a night trying to keep it alive. It died. At eleven, Tama learned the rule of hunger: count everything, hide nothing valuable, and speak carefully.

Etey, Ayu's mother, died in 1387. After her burial, Ayu stopped asking anyone else to settle disputes in her tent. Tama began carrying more of the weight: longer water trips, more cooking, more minding of Sadi when adults argued.

The herd recovered slowly. By 1388, the camp had restocked enough to move without constant fear of loss. Tama spent that year in steady work—water, packing, childcare—while older women began to watch how she carried herself.

In 1389, Koday accepted a betrothal arrangement with a nearby camp. The young man's name was Musa, son of a herder whose family controlled good dry-season pasture. Gift-exchanges followed—small livestock, cloth, and food shared on a visit. Tama stayed with the women, serving and clearing, but Musa sought her out at the edge of the camp when talk thinned in the evening. During one visit, when the families gathered to finalize terms, Tama and Musa slipped away and had sex in the dark beyond the tent line. She said nothing to her mother afterward, washed herself at the water jar, and returned to chores as if nothing had shifted.

In the early summer of 1390, after travel and market contact, Tama fell ill with an acute fever. Ayu kept her in the tent’s shade and pressed water to her lips. Suley, the older woman who made charms, renewed the amulet and recited short Arabic phrases, then burned herbs so the smoke curled around Tama’s body. Tama died on June 19, 1390.

The women washed her, wrapped her in cloth, and tied the bundle. Men carried her away from the tents and placed her in a grave scraped into firm ground, then covered it and set stones to mark the place.

<!--
**Issues found:**
- [Pass 3] Sadi (younger sister) appeared suddenly in lean year paragraph without prior introduction
- [Pass 4] Senay and Kuma vanish after paragraph 3 despite being important siblings
- [Pass 1] Gap between Etey's death (1387) and betrothal (1389) had no content
- [Pass 9] "she knew when to give something back" was vague
- [Pass 9] "On an overnight stay tied to the negotiations" felt mechanical
- [Pass 12] 8 of 12 names were CVCV pattern (67%), exceeding the 50% limit

**Changes made:**
- Introduced Sadi early in paragraph 3 alongside Senay and Kuma
- Added Senay reappearing during lean year (offering to take Sadi)
- Added Kuma reappearing during lean year (trying to save sick goat)
- Added bridge paragraph for 1388 showing recovery and Tama's steady work
- Made the small-deception passage more concrete (offering something to Hannat's daughters)
- Rewrote premarital sex passage with more specific scene-setting
- Changed "sub-household" to "tent" for less jargon
- Renamed characters to reduce CVCV pattern: Sena→Senay, Teno→Tenoy, Bira→Birko, Hana→Hannat
- Added detail about Senay's age gap and why she has authority
- Added detail about Musa's family (controls good dry-season pasture)
