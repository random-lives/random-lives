#   - death_year: -1052
#     name: Garo
#     narrative_role: 'Mixed farmer-herder who teaches routines (foddering, storage
#       discipline). Relationship is respectful but tense: he values Ruma’s industriousness
#       but clashes with her argumentative streak; dies when she is about 20.'
#     role: father
#   - death_year: -1047
#     name: Hena
#     narrative_role: Household subsistence manager who trains Ruma in grinding, cooking,
#       spinning, and careful rationing. Relationship is close but sharp-edged—love
#       expressed through correction and work. Dies when Ruma is about 25, after Ruma
#       has already married out.

#     name: Sama
#     narrative_role: The strict daily-standard enforcer—how water is carried, how grain
#       is stored. Frequently clashes with Ruma (low agreeableness meets authority),
#       yet relies on her competence. Dies when Ruma is about 16.
#     role: paternal grandmother (co-resident in birth household)
#   - death_year: -1039
#     name: Eru
#     narrative_role: Senior woman in husband’s household. Relationship is competitive
#       and tense but interdependent; becomes frail in Ruma’s late 20s and is a primary
#       caregiving burden until shortly after Ruma’s own death.
#     role: mother-in-law (co-resident in adult household)
#   - death_year: -1044
#     name: Kado
#     narrative_role: 'Household elder who negotiates obligations with the local headman.
#       Relationship is wary: he respects her work but dislikes her outspokenness; his

#     name: Lira
#     narrative_role: First child; survives to adulthood and becomes the main bearer

#     name: Sali
#     narrative_role: Fourth child; dies at age 4 after recurring illness episodes,
#       central to the 'sick_relative' caregiving incident. Her death occurs shortly
#       before Ruma’s own final decline.
#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 24
#     connection: Coincides with early child losses and increased tribute/corvée demands;
#       triggers household trade-offs (sell cloth/tools/young animal) and deepens conflict
#       with in-laws over rationing and obligations.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 25
#     connection: Second year of shortage; obligations to a local headman formalize
#       dependence, increasing household labor extraction and stress on marriage.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 26
#     connection: Partial recovery attempt (seed/stock rebuilding) overlaps with Timo’s
#       illness/death, limiting labor and worsening household scarcity.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 27
#     connection: Focused on daughter Sali; caregiving demands reduce textile output
#       and raise water/fuel needs, creating arguments with Eru over ritual vs practical
#       responses.
#     incident: sick_relative
#   - age: 28
#     connection: Recurring relapses; culminates in Sali’s death at age 4 (year -1043),
#       leaving Ruma emotionally and physically depleted.
#     incident: sick_relative
#   - age: 29
#     connection: Eru’s decline turns Ruma into the primary daily caregiver while still
#       running food processing; begins sustained sleep deprivation that worsens psychotic
#       symptoms.
#     incident: elderly_parents
#   - age: 30
#     connection: Caregiving intensifies in winter; conflicts flare over rationing and
#       care methods; Moro and other kin increasingly mediate between Ruma and Eru.
#     incident: elderly_parents
#   - age: 31
#     connection: Care continues until Ruma’s terminal enteric illness; caregiving role
#       abruptly ends, leaving household scrambling for labor and care arrangements.
#     incident: elderly_parents
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6
#     key_events:
#     - Older brother Kenu dies (age 1–2 for Ruma), shaping household fear of childhood
#       sickness and motivating protective place-offerings.
#     - Ruma begins helping with carrying kindling and watching younger siblings; praised
#       for diligence, scolded for arguing back.
#     - Early signs of unusual perceptions/odd fears appear intermittently (night terrors,
#       hearing her name called at the edge of the forest), dismissed as spirits or
#       bad dreams.
#     phase: Early childhood in natal extended household
#   - age_range: 7-15
#     key_events:
#     - Grandfather Boru dies (Ruma ~14); household rites at a stone/spring become more
#       urgent and supervised by elders.
#     - 'Growing labor competence: grinding millet, spinning fiber, winter fodder routines;
#       she becomes a high-output worker.'
#     - 'Corvée/tribute demands become more visible: men mobilized for hauling/earthworks,
#       increasing women’s workload; Ruma becomes outspoken about unfairness.'
#     phase: Later childhood and adolescence
#   - age_range: 16-23
#     key_events:
#     - Marriage to Moro and moderate-distance move into his patrilocal extended household
#       (around age 17).
#     - Birth of first child Lira (age ~18) and subsequent children; repeated childcare
#       and food-processing intensification.
#     - Friction with mother-in-law Eru over authority and methods; Ruma’s low agreeableness
#       shows as blunt public criticism.
#     phase: Marriage migration and early adult household-building
#   - age_range: 24-28
#     key_events:
#     - 'Severe economic crisis (ages 24–26): poor harvests and animal losses; trade
#       away goods and accept obligations to a local headman.'
#     - Deaths of sons Daro (Ruma ~24) and Timo (Ruma ~26) bracket these hard years,
#       increasing grief and social tension.
#     - Recurring illness caregiving for daughter Sali (ages 27–28), with intensified
#       place-spirit offerings and household sanitation efforts.
#     phase: Mid-adulthood stress and loss
#   - age_range: 29-31
#     key_events:
#     - Elderly parent-in-law caregiving becomes primary daily burden (ages 29–31) as
#       Eru (and/or Kado) becomes frail.
#     - 'Psychotic-spectrum symptoms become more disruptive: persecutory ideas tied
#       to neighbors/spirits, hearing voices near the water source, episodes of disorganized
#       behavior; household members manage/contain her.'
#     - Ruma dies of severe gastrointestinal illness/dehydration at 31 (late autumn),
#       after a period of weakness and reduced intake.
#     phase: 'Late adulthood: intensive caregiving and final decline'

#     name: Taro
#     narrative_role: Younger brother close in age; as children they compete and bicker,

#     death_age: 27
#     death_year: -1041
#     name: Senu
#     narrative_role: Younger brother who dies the same year as Ruma; his death deepens

#   - birth_year: -1066
#     death_age: 63
#     death_year: -1003
#     name: Nali
#     narrative_role: Youngest sister; affectionate but often overwhelmed by Ruma’s
#       bluntness. As adults, Nali is the one who visits most reliably and later becomes
#       the family memory-keeper of Ruma and her children.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Household relies on her competence, but others resent her strict
#       standards; during crises, her control attempts intensify conflict.
#     scene: 'Meticulous grain storage and rationing: she counts measures by sight,
#       keeps tools in fixed places, and insists on cleaning vessels after illness episodes.'
#     timing: adolescence through adulthood (ages 12–31)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (very high)
#   - consequence: Frequent household tension; reduced social support in hard years,
#       and harsher interpretations of her later unusual behavior.
#     scene: Openly contradicts elders/in-laws during communal work (harvest, spinning
#       circles), calling out perceived laziness or unfair shares; quick to accuse others
#       of wasting grain.
#     timing: especially after marriage (ages 16–31)
#     trait: Agreeableness (very low)
#   - consequence: Stability in ordinary years, but missed opportunities to adapt; intensifies
#       friction when exchange networks bring new goods/practices.
#     scene: Prefers established routines and ancestral methods; rejects experimental
#       planting/feeding ideas brought by traders or younger men, insisting on 'the
#       way the elders did it.'
#     timing: adolescence to mid-adulthood (ages 14–26)
#     trait: Openness (low)
#   - consequence: Becomes a visible figure in the household compound (useful during
#       coordination), but also draws attention when conflicts or symptoms arise.
#     scene: Talkative and assertive in group labor settings; takes charge of coordinating
#       women’s tasks during large food-processing days, but can dominate conversations.
#     timing: late childhood onward (ages 10–31)
#     trait: Extraversion (moderately high)
#   - consequence: Family restricts her tasks at times (e.g., not sending her alone
#       to fetch water at night), conflicts escalate with in-laws/neighbors, and her
#       authority in household decisions becomes contested.
#     scene: 'Episodes of auditory hallucinations and persecutory interpretations: she
#       hears her name whispered near the water source; later insists a neighbor’s gestures
#       ''bind'' illness to the household, leading to disorganized nighttime checking
#       of doors, stores, and sleeping children.'
#     timing: prodromal hints ages 6–12; clearer episodes ages 27–31 (worsening with

#     trait: Psychotic-spectrum disorder (must be visible)
# number_of_children: '4'
# number_of_siblings: '4'
# occupation: Household subsistence worker (food processing/cooking, childcare, fuel/water

# structured_incidents:
# - event: A run of poor harvests and animal losses left her husband’s extended household
#     short of millet and winter fodder; they were forced to trade away stored grain
#     and useful goods (cloth, tools, or a young animal) and take obligations to a local
#     headman in exchange for food seed and protection.
#   reasoning: Agrarian commoners were highly vulnerable to harvest failure, animal
#     loss, illness shocks, and tribute demands; extended-family buffering helps but
#     cannot prevent all severe downturns.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 24–26 (sustained period spanning two agricultural cycles)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: She spent weeks nursing a small child through repeated bouts of fever and
#     severe diarrhea, preparing thin millet gruel and hauling extra water while trying
#     to keep bedding and vessels clean; the illness lingered and weakened the child
#     despite household remedies and local ritual offerings at a nearby spring/stone.
#   reasoning: High infectious burden plus an extended household makes it fairly likely
#     she spent weeks-to-months nursing a sick child, spouse, or in-law; repeated childhood
#     illness in her household is strongly suggested by three children dying at age
#     4.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 27–28 (recurring episodes across one warm season into the next)
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: As a daughter-in-law in a patrilocal household, she took primary responsibility
#     for an aging parent-in-law with limited mobility—fetching water and fuel, preparing
#     softened food, and managing washing and bedding—while still maintaining textile
#     work and food processing for the rest of the household.
#   reasoning: In patrilocal extended households, daughters-in-law often provided substantial
#     day-to-day support to aging parents-in-law if they survived into frailty, though
#     high adult mortality reduces how often this became a long, primary responsibility
#     by her early 30s.
#   tier: 2

Ruma was born in a low, damp plain near the sea in the northeast, where scattered farming hamlets sat between patches of mixed forest and open ground. Her people lived by millet fields and herds, answering to local heads who demanded labor and portions of grain when they called for it. Far to the southwest, Shang rulers cast bronzes and wrote on bone, but Ruma’s household kept its own order with kin authority and offerings at a spring and a standing stone.

Her father, Garo, kept a small herd and watched the stores. He set the rhythm of the day with animal foddering and field checks. Her mother, Hena, ran the inside work: grinding, cooking, spinning fiber, keeping water and fuel moving, keeping children fed. Ruma arrived as the second child. The first, her brother Kenu, still lived then, a toddler who followed the older men with a stick in his hand. When Ruma was one, Kenu’s belly sickness came fast. He cried through the night, then went quiet. Boru, her father’s father, took a bowl of millet porridge and a cup of fermented drink to the stone beyond the last houses and set them down with both hands. For a long time afterward, Hena kept Ruma close when flies gathered and water ran low.

Two more boys followed—Taro and Senu—and then a girl, Nali. The house was crowded with children, older kin, and tools. Ruma grew tall early, long-limbed, with a quick stride. She learned to carry water without spilling and to stack fuel so it stayed dry. She argued with Sama, her grandmother, over small points—how to place the grinding stone, how to rinse a pot, how much chaff to leave in a basket. Sama answered with sharp words and an extra task. Ruma did the task faster than asked and returned with her jaw set.

Sometimes, when she was small, she woke and spoke into the dark as if someone stood at the door. Once, at nine, she ran from the spring at dusk and said her name had been called from the reeds. Boru listened, then walked with her the next day, pointing out the bird tracks and the rabbit droppings, telling her which sounds belonged to water and which to wind. He still told Hena to leave a small pinch of millet at the spring’s edge.

By her early teens, corvée demands pulled men away for hauling earth and timber. Garo and Boru went out with other households, leaving women and children to keep the fields and animals steady. Ruma took over jobs usually given to older girls: watching the herd while spinning fiber, cutting weeds from the millet, and sealing storage pits after filling them. She liked the clean look of a well-packed store. She disliked waste. When Taro tried to sneak roasted millet from the drying tray, she slapped his hand and told him to chew grass if he wanted to eat between meals. He chased her, laughing, and she chased him back, faster than he expected.

Boru died when she was fourteen, after a winter that left him thin and coughing. Sama followed two years later. The household shrank and changed. Hena worked without the older woman watching her shoulder. Ruma still heard correction in her head and did not slow down. She also started speaking more openly in work gatherings, not lowering her voice for elders. When a neighbor woman asked for an extra scoop of grain in exchange for a bundle of reeds, Ruma refused and said the reeds were half-rotten. Hena hissed at her afterward; Ruma answered with a list of what the household had already given away.

At seventeen she left. A marriage was arranged with Moro from a community a moderate distance away, reached by a day of walking and another by cart track through low hills and scrub. The move placed her in a larger patrilocal household, with her father-in-law Kado and her mother-in-law Eru controlling stores and decisions. Ruma arrived with textiles Hena had helped her weave and a few household goods. Eru inspected the cloth with two fingers, then set it aside without praise. Ruma met Moro’s eyes once, then looked away and went straight to the grinding stone as if she had always lived there.

A daughter, Lira, came when Ruma was eighteen. The birth took her out of work for only a short time. She was up again, washing cloth and tending a pot, with the baby tied close. Lira learned early to sit quietly near the hearth while Ruma worked. Ruma hummed short tunes while twisting fiber; she did it without thinking. When Penu, a neighbor woman in the cluster of compounds, came over to spin and talk, Ruma talked back quickly and kept her hands moving. With Penu she sometimes laughed—short, sharp bursts—when someone else did something foolish, like a man dropping a load of fodder into the mud. Penu liked gossip. Ruma liked news about exchanges and obligations, because it told her what would be demanded next.

Trade thickened in the region in those years. Men like Haro brought salt and bits of bronze, and with them came messages: the headman wanted carts, wanted grain, wanted bodies to haul. Moro went out on some of these demands and came back tired and angry. Ruma met him at the gate, took the bundle off his shoulder, and told him what the stores held down to the last basket.

Her sons came next. Daro was born when she was twenty-one. Two years later, Timo followed. Ruma’s house filled with children’s noise and the smell of wet clothing. She kept the water jars topped and the hearth clean enough to cook fast. She demanded that Lira wash her hands before touching the baby, and she hit Lira once on the arm for lying about it. The child cried; Ruma did not apologize. Later she put a warm lump of millet cake in Lira’s palm and said, “Eat, then work.”

When Ruma turned twenty-four, stores failed. A cool season hurt the millet, then an illness ran through animals. One young animal died; another limped and ate little. Fodder ran short before winter ended. Ruma stripped old thatch for bedding and fed husks to pigs. Kado argued that they should keep seed back; Eru argued that they should trade cloth. Ruma told them both the measures in the pits and said they were already behind. She went with Moro to see Yoro, the local headman. They carried cloth and a tool with a good edge. Yoro accepted the goods and offered seed and a promise of protection, but he set obligations on their household. Moro agreed because they needed grain. Ruma’s mouth tightened; she said nothing until they were outside, then told Moro he had traded too much.

The crisis stretched through two agricultural cycles. Men were pulled for hauling and work on earthworks. Ruma’s spinning fingers cracked in the cold, and she wrapped them in thin cloth to keep working. In the middle of this, Daro fell ill and did not recover. She washed him, kept him warm, and fed him thin gruel. When he died, she carried his small body out with Moro and Eru to where children were placed and covered. She returned and scrubbed the hearth stones until her hands bled.

Timo died two years later, at four. Ruma’s anger sharpened into constant edge. She accused Penu of borrowing a pot and returning it dirty; she accused a boy of stealing fodder; she accused Moro of letting Yoro’s men count their stores with greedy eyes. Moro shouted back once, then stopped arguing in public and saved his words for night. Ruma slept poorly. She started going out after dark to check the store pit covers, pressing her ear to the packed earth as if she could hear something under it.

Her youngest, Sali, was born when Ruma was twenty-five. At twenty-seven Sali became the child Ruma watched every minute. Fever came, then severe diarrhea. Ruma boiled water, cooled it, and fed it slowly. She cleaned cloth again and again, carried buckets from the spring, and kept a small fire going for warmth. She took millet and drink to the spring and to the stone and set them down with precise hands. Oli, an elder who handled such rites, came and spoke over the offerings. Ruma listened, then returned to the child and argued with Eru about keeping visitors away. Sali improved, then relapsed, again and again across the warm season into the next. During the worst nights Ruma heard her name whispered outside the wall. She stepped out with a firebrand and stood scanning the dark, convinced someone was moving near the water jars. Moro pulled her back inside. She fought him, then went still and stared at the floor, as if listening to something no one else could hear.

Sali died when Ruma was twenty-nine. After that, Eru’s body began to fail. Eru’s knees swelled; she could not walk far. Ruma became the one who fetched water and fuel, cooked softened food, and washed Eru’s cloths. She did it fast and in order, but with little gentleness. When Eru complained, Ruma answered with a list of tasks she had already done. Kado had died years earlier; without him, household decisions were sharper fights between women and Moro. Ruma’s voice carried across the compound, and neighbors heard.

At thirty, she began insisting that Penu’s gestures across the lane “bound” sickness to their house. She accused Penu of speaking at the spring against them. When Moro told her to stop, she said he had been bought with seed from Yoro and would not admit it. Lira, now a young woman, tried to calm her. Ruma took Lira’s hands and checked them for dirt, then for no reason asked if Lira had heard whispering at night. Lira said no. Ruma did not believe her.

The last autumn brought Ruma the illness she had fought so often in others. Diarrhea started, then relentless thirst. She refused water at times, saying it tasted wrong, then demanded it and drank too quickly. Moro and Lira tried to feed her thin gruel. She pushed the bowl away, then grabbed it back. She went to the doorway and called out names that did not match anyone in the compound. Within days she could not keep food or water down. On a cold morning she lay on a reed mat near the hearth and stopped responding while Lira wiped her mouth and Moro held her shoulders.

They washed her body and wrapped it in cloth from the household stores. Moro and his kin carried her to the burial ground and placed her in the earth with a small bowl of millet and a cup set beside her hands, then packed the soil down hard.
