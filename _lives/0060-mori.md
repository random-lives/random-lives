Mori was born in a small western Yangshao farming hamlet on the Loess Plateau, where families spoke an early Sino‑Tibetan tongue and answered to no distant court, only to elders and kin nearby. Her father, Boro, worked narrow millet plots and kept a few animals close to the house. The soil was pale and loose, and wind carried dust into the doorway. Her mother, Sani, spent her days grinding millet on stone, cooking porridge, fetching water, and cutting fuel from the scrubby slopes.

Mori arrived as the second child. Her brother Karu was three and still small enough to sleep near the hearth. He watched when Sani rinsed the newborn and rubbed her skin with warm water. In the first weeks Mori stayed wrapped against Sani’s chest while Sani stirred pots and shook chaff from harvested stalks. When Boro left at dawn, he touched Mori’s forehead once and stepped out with a digging stick and a woven bag.

Late in the cold season, Mori began to cough and then passed watery stool. Sani kept her at the breast and tried small offerings outdoors: a pinch of cooked millet and a splash of water set on bare earth at the edge of the yard for the ground spirits, then a second offering at a nearby gully where runoff cut through the loess. She tied a knotted cord at Mori’s wrist and kept smoke low, but the sickness continued.

On the seventh week Mori died in the house. Boro and Sani wrapped her in cloth and placed her in a small pit near the dwelling, setting a little bowl of millet gruel beside her before covering the soil flat.
