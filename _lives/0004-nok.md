historical_notes:
  - "Time/place anchor: Nok is set in the mid-Holocene, 3388–3336 BC, in the interfluvial forests near modern Sena Madureira, Acre, Brazil (approx. 10.33°S, 69.25°W; ~276 m elevation), a low-density tropical moist-forest setting where short-term camps can be archaeologically hard to detect."
  - "Identity limits (language/ethnicity): No specific ethnonym or language can be securely assigned to a 4th-millennium-BC forager band in this exact Acre interfluvial area; the ‘Southwest Amazon interfluvial rainforest hunter-gatherer band’ and ‘unclassified/unknown Amazonian language’ labels should be treated as explicitly unrecoverable placeholders rather than historical identifications."
  - "Material-culture/verification constraint: Because organic materials decay rapidly in humid Amazonian contexts and many occupations are ephemeral, specific biographical details in the narrative (named individuals, disputes, reputations, exact household arrangements) are not independently verifiable without associated human remains or a well-documented site—so they should be read as plausible reconstruction, not recoverable history."
  - "Subsistence plausibility with caveat: A mobile, non-agricultural forager economy emphasizing fishing/trapping plus forest foods is broadly consistent with what is documented for some pre-ceramic/early forager contexts in greater southwest Amazonia, but the particular toolkit and practices described for Nok cannot be linked to a specific, dated site near Sena Madureira on current evidence."
  - "Demography (infant mortality): Multiple infant deaths in one sibship is demographically plausible for small forager populations, but there are no locale- and century-specific mortality rates available for Nok’s immediate region and time; this point can be supported only at the level of general comparative inference."
  - "Cause of death (violence) evidentiary limit: Homicide is a plausible narrative cause in small-scale societies, but in this Amazonian setting it would usually be archaeologically demonstrable only if Nok’s remains were recovered with diagnostic trauma; absent remains, the manner of death is untestable and should be flagged as narrative-level attribution."

Nok was born in the wet season, when the nights stayed warm and the forest floor stayed slick. Her band kept to the interfluvial forest, camping near narrow streams and flooded backwaters. They did not plant. They shifted camp when fruiting trees thinned, when game moved off, when the water changed.

Her first shelter sat close to her mother’s kin. Her grandmother held a place by the main hearth and ended arguments with a few words that stopped people. Nok’s father hunted with other men and came back with small deer, monkeys, birds, or nothing but wet feet and a story. Nok watched him slice meat with a stone blade and scrape bone clean. She copied him too soon, nicked herself, and kept her face blank.

She was the first of five. One younger brother lived into old age. The other three died as infants. Adults spoke each name once, then stopped using it. When Nok asked questions, she got silence and stares that warned her off.

As a child she pushed into other people’s space. When older girls played in a shallow backwater, she shoved into deeper water and grabbed at them until someone shoved back. She laughed when she went under and came up coughing. When she was punished—sat in a dark lean-to while others ate—she waited for the talk to drift, slipped out, and took a roasted piece anyway. An aunt slapped her. Nok stared at her, chewing, and did not cry. Her grandmother watched and did not step in. Conversation around the hearth broke and restarted in a different place.

She remembered routes after one walk and knew which ground stayed firm after days of rain. She could not hold patience for fine work. Her mother tried to teach her to twist fiber cord. Nok pulled too hard, then too loose. The strand came out uneven and snapped. She threw it down and walked off to check a snare. When older women spoke to her about it, she answered sharp and loud, then acted as if she could not hear.

At night the band gathered. Feet stamped the soil. Voices answered in short lines, one side calling and the other returning it. Nok shoved to the front. She clapped too close to faces and cut across elders’ words. When someone corrected a story, she corrected back, smiling as if the circle belonged to her. People laughed once, then stopped. Her grandmother’s hand on her shoulder pinned her there until Nok’s body went still.

By her teens she followed hunters because she chose to. They did not invite her. When a man signaled her to stop, she stopped. When he signaled her to wait, she waited with her jaw tight, rubbing the edge of a stone point with her thumb. She kept control where she wanted it. She never lost her blade. She never forgot where she hid her bone barbs and the coil of fiber line she guarded like meat. But she broke agreements. She promised to carry water and did not. She promised to share the first fish and hid it until an aunt saw grease on her hands and took it.

People expected adults to pair up, share work, and tie households together. Nok refused. Men left gifts near where she slept: a sharp flake, smoked meat, fruit wrapped in leaves. She took what was left and gave nothing back. When a man tried to speak as if he had claim to her in front of others, she made it a fight. She shouted until children stared. Once she spat near his feet. After that, mothers stopped leaving her alone with their daughters, and they pulled small boys back when she passed.

She fed herself anyway. She worked the water more than the forest because she could do it without anyone standing over her. She set fish traps in narrow runs—stakes and woven panels—and she used bone barbs on short lines where fish held close. When she needed a panel, she paid for it with fish if the owner confronted her. If no one watched, she took it and dared them to argue. She knew where fish held when the current shifted and where turtles rose to breathe. She came back with food on days when others came back empty. No one called her kind. They called her useful, and they watched their things.

In her early adulthood the rains came hard and kept coming. The stream rose into the low forest and spread into moving brown water. Familiar paths vanished. A bank collapsed near camp and trees slid, roots exposed. The band shifted to higher ground, a ridge where shelter poles had to be wedged between roots. Nok liked the ridge because she could see farther between trunks and hear footsteps sooner.

The flood ruined the usual fishing places. Pools turned into one wide sheet and people grew hungry and quick-tempered. Nok did not join the complaints. She walked the new edges alone until she found calmer pockets behind fallen trunks. She broke branches and pushed them into the mud as markers. Before dawn she returned, reset her lines, and pulled fish in a steady rhythm. When she came back she said little. She held the string of fish up where everyone could see it.

After that, people asked her for help they would not have asked for before. Where was firm ground. Which channel stayed fast. Where the water cut deep. Nok answered when it suited her and withheld what did not. When someone tried to tell her what to do with the catch, she turned her back and ate first.

She built a small shelter at the edge of camp, close enough to hear voices, far enough that no one stepped over her at night. She kept her tools wrapped under bark and dry leaves. Points stayed tucked into a roll. Tinder stayed under the roof. She repaired storm damage without being told. She also took what she wanted: a better blade, a coil of fiber, a strip of meat set aside for someone else’s child. When caught, she did not apologize. She argued until spit gathered at the corners of her mouth. She blamed the other person for leaving it where she could reach it. If pushed, she offered fish to end the talk, not to make it right. People accepted because they wanted food and because pressing her meant a public fight.

When other bands passed through and camps swelled for a few nights, old grudges travelled with them. Nok walked through the visitors as if they owed her room. She put her hands on shoulders without asking and leaned in too close. She asked who had lost a blade, who had been accused of taking meat, who had fought at the last shared camp. She repeated those answers at home when she wanted someone to back down. The names stuck. People began to meet her eyes less and watch the edge of her shelter more.

In her last years tension tightened around the band. Hunters came back scanning the trees instead of joking. Parents kept children near the hearth. Nok did not change. She pushed her traps farther out to a narrow channel that ran fast even in the dry season. It fed her and kept her away from hands that reached for her share.

On the day she died, the forest steamed after rain. Nok walked alone with her bundle and stone blade, stepping over wet roots, listening for fish breaking the surface. At her trap line she saw ties that had been cut and retied in a hurry. The knots were wrong. Someone had been there.

She stood and called into the trees, naming the theft loud enough to carry down the channel.

A person moved close. Not a stranger. Someone from the wider circle of camps, someone she had shamed before and taken from. They shouted over each other. Nok stepped forward instead of back and reached for the line as if force could make it hers again.

The other person drove a sharpened point into her low and quick, the kind of strike used on animals. Nok fell onto the wet bank and tried to rise, hands sliding in mud. The attacker struck again and left her there. Nok lay where the water lapped at the edge, breathing hard, fingers opening and closing as if still gripping cord. The channel kept running. Birds and insects filled the sound after her voice stopped.
