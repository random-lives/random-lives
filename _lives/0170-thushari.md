#     name: Nadeesha
#     narrative_role: Youngest sister; spirited and more socially bold. In adulthood
#       she is the one most likely to speak bluntly about family conflicts (especially
#       the divorce and money), while still showing up during crises.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Family leans on her as the stabilizer; however, her calm can be misread
#       as emotional coldness by her children or siblings.
#     scene: During a tense clinic visit and later during a fuel-shortage day, she stays
#       notably calm, speaks plainly, and focuses on next steps (bus times, prescriptions,
#       who will watch the children) while others panic or argue.
#     timing: mid-adulthood, especially 2020–2023
#     trait: Very low neuroticism (3rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Builds goodwill and practical support networks, but increases risk
#       of being taken advantage of (extra unpaid favors, family expecting her to shoulder
#       care work).
#     scene: In factory boarding life she mediates roommate conflicts, lends small sums,
#       and avoids open confrontation with supervisors; at home she absorbs criticism
#       about divorce without escalating.
#     timing: young adulthood through mid-adulthood (2003–2026)
#     trait: High agreeableness (79th percentile)
#   - consequence: Fewer protective social ties outside family; relies heavily on kin
#       networks and one or two trusted coworkers rather than broad community support.
#     scene: She keeps a small circle, avoids workplace gossip groups, and prefers quiet
#       evenings writing letters/handling accounts; she finds large social gatherings
#       draining.
#     timing: adolescence onward
#     trait: Low extraversion (14th percentile)
#   - consequence: Creates recurring small crises (last-minute scrambling), contributes
#       to job hopping within the garment sector, and increases dependence on organized
#       relatives (often the eldest sister) for planning.
#     scene: She is capable and smart but struggles with consistent routines—misses
#       a school meeting, forgets a document needed for a clinic visit, or procrastinates
#       on paperwork until a deadline forces action.
#     timing: school years and throughout adulthood
#     trait: Low conscientiousness (14th percentile)
#   - consequence: Stability in identity and routines; fewer big leaps (e.g., overseas
#       migration or radical career change), which limits upward mobility but avoids
#       some risks.
#     scene: She favors familiar solutions—trusted temple/blessing rituals alongside
#       clinic care, and practical job choices over retraining; she is cautious about
#       moving far from the home district.
#     timing: adulthood
#     trait: Lower openness (24th percentile)
#   - consequence: Helps her protect scarce resources; can create mild mistrust with
#       siblings over money allocations for parents.
#     scene: When negotiating wages/loans or dealing with a difficult ex-partner, she
#       can be strategically selective with information (e.g., not disclosing exact
#       overtime pay), though not overtly exploitative.
#     timing: post-separation years (2015–2026)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility low-ish (26th percentile)
#   - consequence: Allows her to function effectively despite low conscientiousness;
#       becomes the 'problem-solver' in the family during bureaucratic or medical hurdles.
#     scene: She quickly learns factory processes, keeps mental track of costs, and
#       helps children with schoolwork; she can navigate hospital systems and paperwork
#       when she focuses.
#     timing: school age onward; peaks in caregiving coordination years
#     trait: Higher intelligence (75th percentile)
# number_of_children: '2'
# number_of_siblings: '3'
# occupation: Garment/apparel factory worker (including FTZ or regional factories; circular
#   migrant)
# religion: Theravada Buddhist practice mixed with folk/astrological/deity rituals (bara/vows,
#   blessings, occasional healing rituals)
# sibling_ages_at_death:
# - alive
# - alive
# - alive
# sibling_sexes:
# - F
# - M
# - F
# structured_incidents:
# - event: After a close relative died unexpectedly, she took in one of the deceased’s
#     young children to her parents’ home in the Batuwangala area, enrolling the child
#     in the local school and covering day-to-day expenses using money she sent back
#     from her garment-factory job during her work stints away.
#   reasoning: Taking in and raising non-biological children occurs (kin fostering),
#     but being a separated garment worker with two children makes full-time raising
#     of additional orphaned children less likely.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 29–34
#   type: orphaned_children
# - event: As her parents’ health declined, she became the main organizer and hands-on
#     caregiver—arranging clinic visits at the nearest government hospital, managing
#     medicines, and doing daily care when she was home, while coordinating siblings
#     and neighbors during the periods she was away on factory work.
#   reasoning: By her late 30s/early 40s, parents are often entering older age, and
#     daughters commonly become primary coordinators/caregivers—especially after marital
#     separation and with continued ties to the home village.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 35–41

Thushari was born on December 13, 1984, in Batuwangala in the wet hill country between Ratnapura and Galle, in a Sinhalese-speaking Buddhist household. The area sat under the Sri Lankan state’s ordinary rural administration—Grama Niladhari offices, schools, clinics—while the civil war shaped the country’s news and travel rules even when fighting was far away.

Her father, Somapala, left early each morning in a clean shirt for his lower-level government job. He brought home stamped papers, small talk about transfers, and a steady pay packet that made the family feel safer than the day-labor households nearby. Her mother, Kusum, worked in service jobs that shifted with opportunity—shop work, helping at a nearby estate office, short periods of domestic work. The house was a nuclear one: two parents and four children, without grandparents living under the same roof. There was a shelf with a Buddha image and a framed print of Kataragama. On some mornings Kusum lit an oil lamp, put a few jasmine flowers in a cup, and laid a banana on a plate before the image. When someone fell sick, she tied a thread at a shrine and promised a small offering if the fever broke.

Thushari grew up as the third child. Kumari, born in 1979, learned to cook first and counted the rice for the pot with the seriousness of a small adult. Sujeewa, born in 1981, was the brother who could ride a bicycle fast down a slope and fix a loose chain. Nadeesha came in 1987 and followed Thushari everywhere, pulling at her skirt and asking questions. With Kusum often away during the day, Kumari set the rules when they came home from school, and Thushari learned early to avoid arguments by agreeing and moving on.

School suited her in an uneven way. She learned to read Sinhala quickly and liked copying neat lines in her exercise books when she felt like it. On other days she forgot a book at home or left homework unfinished because she had started helping Nadeesha with a lesson and then drifted into gossip with her sisters. She was quiet in class. When teachers scolded the room, she looked straight at them and did not flinch or cry. Even as a child she kept a steady face that adults read as good manners.

In 1996, when the Central Bank bombing shook Colombo, the news reached the village in fragments—radio reports, men arguing at the tea shop, relatives warning each other about buses and stations. Somapala became stricter about where the children went. When the family traveled to town, they passed checkpoints. Thushari watched soldiers search bags, then went back to thinking about the sweets she wanted at the shop.

By fifteen she had a sharp sense for numbers and prices. She could walk into the pola, glance at a pile of vegetables, and tell her mother if the seller was overcharging. She also avoided the crowded parts of festivals. At temple perahera nights she stayed near the edge with Kumari, listening but not pushing forward. She preferred the quiet time after dinner when the yard cooled and the frogs started calling. Sometimes she sat on the step and ate a piece of ripe papaya with a pinch of salt while Nadeesha talked at her.

She left school in 2002 after completing her ordinary level exams. Somapala wanted more, but money and motivation did not line up. Thushari did not fight with him. She listened, nodded, and then made her own plan. The garment industry was expanding and recruiters came through nearby towns. In 2003 she took her first job in a factory and began a pattern of circular migration: weeks or months away in a town with a boarding house, then home again to Batuwangala with a bag of clothes and a little money for the household.

Boarding-house life taught her quick rules. Keep your money close. Keep your soap and towel where no one can “borrow” them. Speak politely to supervisors. If roommates fought, step between them and talk each one down. She made one close friend there, Shyamali, who liked cheap jokes and spicy snacks. They shared parcels of isso wade from the street stall and laughed quietly at the nicknames other girls used for strict line leaders. Thushari did not join every outing, but she stayed loyal to the few people she trusted.

In 2007 she met Upul through village connections when she was home on leave. He worked steadily and talked about building a proper life. Thushari liked that he spoke plainly and did not demand she entertain his friends. They married that year. When food and fuel prices surged in 2008, they cut back hard: fewer bus trips, fewer treats for the younger ones, more dhal and less fish. Thushari took extra shifts and changed factories once to keep wages steady.

Her first daughter, Ruwani, was born in 2009. Thushari returned to factory work after the early months, because one income could not cover everything. Kusum and Somapala became daily caregivers without moving into a larger household. Ruwani slept at their house when Thushari was away. Thushari sent money and tried to keep up with school forms, but she forgot things. Once she arrived home and found Ruwani had missed a school payment deadline because Thushari had left the envelope on the table and walked out without it. She fixed it the next day, calm and brisk, but Kumari scolded her for being careless.

Samanthi was born in 2012. Two children tightened the household budget and Upul’s temper. He questioned her about coworkers and accused her of hiding money, and when he drank he pushed and hit. Thushari did not scream or collapse. She kept her voice flat, moved the children away, and waited for the moment she could leave the room. The marriage ended in 2015, after another episode of violence and a long argument about wages and control. She took the children back to her parents’ home and made the separation final.

That same year a close relative died suddenly, leaving a young child without a stable home. Thushari brought the child into her parents’ house and registered them at the local school. She set up a routine that depended on remittances: factory work, money sent home, and careful instructions to Kumari and Kusum about uniforms and books. The extra child stretched everyone’s patience. Sujeewa complained about costs but offered rides when he could. Thushari avoided long confrontations; she said “I’ll handle it” and found a way to pay.

Monsoon seasons got harsher. In 2017 floods and landslides disrupted roads and buses in the south. Thushari lost workdays because transport stopped, and she spent money repairing leaks and replacing damp bedding at home. During those years she began stopping at the temple more often, not for long sermons but for small acts—lighting a lamp, placing a few coins in the box, asking Ven. Sumangala for a blessing thread for the children before exams. She also kept up the household mix of practical and ritual: clinic visits when needed, and a vow at a shrine when fear rose.

COVID-19 arrived in 2020 and closed factories, then reopened them on reduced shifts. The children’s schooling broke into phone messages and printed sheets. At the same time, her parents’ health declined. Kusum developed chronic problems that required regular clinic visits and medicines. Somapala grew slower and began forgetting instructions. Thushari became the organizer. She phoned the clinic, arranged transport with Mahinda the three-wheeler driver when buses were unreliable, and learned which medicines were out of stock and where to find substitutes. At the hospital she came to know Sister Nirmala, a nurse who told her which line moved fastest and which forms mattered.

By 2022, the economic crisis made everything harder: fuel lines, rising food prices, shortages of medicine. Thushari kept working when she could, taking short stints in the garment sector and returning home to manage care. She kept her accounts in a small notebook, adding columns, crossing out mistakes, starting again. Her daughters grew into teenagers. Ruwani studied quietly and helped the younger children with homework. Samanthi argued more, pressing Thushari about why their father was absent and why money was always tight.

Late 2025 finds Thushari back in Batuwangala most weeks. She wakes before dawn, rinses rice, lights the lamp before the Buddha image, and packs a small bag for the day: clinic book, medicine packets, a bottle of water. When the house is quiet, she sits on the step and eats a piece of fruit with salt, listening for the bus on the road below, then calls to the children to get ready for school.
