Nazneen was born on September 17, 1962, in Gaighat in Muzaffarpur district, in a lane of small houses where the handpumps and cooking fires were close and the fields began not far beyond the last row of walls. Her father left early in a clean shirt her mother had pressed with a heavy iron, and rode his bicycle to the office where he kept registers, copied figures, and stamped papers. His salary came regular enough to keep the rent paid and the grain tin filled. On Eid he brought a small box of sweets and set it on the shelf out of reach until after the prayers.

They lived as a separate unit. No grandparents slept in the next room, no uncles sat in the doorway directing the day. Her mother ran the house without help: cooking on a smoky stove, drawing water, rinsing clothes at the pump, keeping the drinking water covered. She kept a strict order in the one room that mattered, but Nazneen did not hold to it.

Nazneen listened more than she talked at first. When she spoke she moved between languages without noticing—Urdu at home, and Hindi or Maithili when a neighbor called her name from the lane. She watched her father’s hands when he counted notes or sorted papers brought home in a cloth bag. Later she copied him with torn newspaper, folding it into piles and insisting on knowing what each mark meant. When an answer was shortened, she asked again and again until it was complete.

The same mind that fixed on a question did not stay with daily rules. She left her sandals in the middle of the doorway and forgot where she had put the cup she had just used. She started tasks and abandoned them. Her mother would tell her once, then again, then step over the sandals herself with irritation she did not bother to soften. Nazneen did not apologize easily. She looked up as if listening, then ran off to whatever caught her next.

In Muharram the room changed. Women gathered and sat close, reciting and crying in a steady cadence. Nazneen fidgeted at the edge until a line or a name caught her attention, and then she went still. Afterward there were dates and sweetened water. When they went out, her mother dressed her plainly in dark clothes and kept her near, a hand on her shoulder as they walked to the imambargah.

There were four children in the house in those years. Nazneen was the second. Her older sister carried her when their mother’s hands were full. A baby brother was born and died before he had grown sturdy; after that, the nights were quieter and the adults spoke in lower voices.

In early January 1967 the cold settled into the house through the cracks around the door. Nazneen’s diarrhea began and did not stop. At first her mother kept her off the outside food and gave her boiled water in small sips. By the next day Nazneen was too weak to sit up for long. She vomited when she drank. Her mouth went dry and her eyes lost their shine.

Her father took her out to a local practitioner. The man wrote a note, spoke quickly, and handed over packets of powder. They mixed them with water and tried to make her swallow. She could not keep much down. By the morning of January 11 she lay on the charpoy and did not ask questions anymore. Her lips were cracked, her skin hot and slack, and her mother kept wiping her face and putting a spoon to her mouth. Nazneen died that day before the light moved off the floor.
