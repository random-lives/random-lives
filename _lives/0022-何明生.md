He Mingsheng was born on November 5, 1879, in Yuefeng outside Chenzhou in southern Hunan, under the Guangxu Emperor’s Qing officials and the local gentry who handled taxes, disputes, and militia matters. His family were Han and spoke a Gan topolect at home. They kept an ancestral tablet in the main room and burned incense on festival days, and they carried offerings to the village temple when the household could spare them.

He arrived as the first child in a three-generation household. His grandfather, He Shoutian, slept on the kang in the inner room through the winters, and his grandmother, Madam He, ran the kitchen and decided how much rice went into the pot. Mingsheng’s father, He Yongfu, worked the family’s fields and rented an extra strip of land when the harvest looked promising. His mother, Liu Shizhen, kept the stove, washed clothes in the stream, tended pigs and chickens, and joined the fieldwork when transplanting and harvest crowded the days.

Children came quickly after him. Two of his siblings died as infants; two more died before they could speak clearly. The household did not pause for long. The adults wrapped the bodies, arranged a simple burial, and went back to the paddies. Mingsheng watched without knowing what to do with his hands. When his mother sent him to carry water or cut grass for the pig, he moved fast, then stopped to stare at the market road, tracking every pack load and shouting porter that went by.

He did not learn characters. The village teacher took him for a short time, tapping his knuckles with a thin stick when he lost his place in the recitation. Mingsheng laughed too easily at other boys’ mistakes and talked when the room was meant to be quiet. He went back to the fields. His father decided the fees and the lost labor were waste. Mingsheng could not write his name. He marked tools with a cut in the wood and recognized sacks by their stitching.

Tax time shaped the year. Runners came down from the yamen with lists and demands. The household paid land tax and extra levies that rose without warning. His father carried copper cash to the market town and came home angry about the exchange rate. Once, after a poor season, He Yongfu borrowed grain against the next harvest and swore at the lender in the doorway until his own father pulled him back by the sleeve.

The weather shifted hard in some years. A late rain left cracked ground on the upland plots. Another year storms flattened beans and washed soil off the slopes. When the rice price rose, Madam He cut meals thinner and sent Mingsheng and his younger brother, Mingyuan, to dig sweet potatoes early. Mingsheng complained loudly and then went anyway, working with quick bursts, talking all the while, turning his head at every sound from the path.

He carried loads to the market: bundles of firewood, a piglet in a basket, sheaves of straw to trade for salt. He liked the noise of the stalls and the shouting. He lingered near the opera stage during temple fairs until his mother dragged him away. He made friends easily and got into fights just as easily. A boy from another hamlet grabbed his shoulder once as a joke and Mingsheng swung without thinking, splitting the boy’s lip. His grandmother made him kneel and knock his head to the floor in apology. He did it, then argued about it afterward in the yard until his grandfather barked at him to shut up.

By the time Mingsheng was fifteen, the household had changed. One parent was gone from the home; the remaining adults kept the fields going and watched the children more closely. Mingsheng took on more of the heavy work: mud up to his calves in the paddy, lifting water with a pole, hauling manure, carrying rice bundles to the threshing ground. He moved with energy, but he forgot instructions and miscounted shares when grain was portioned. His grandmother took the measuring basket back from him and did it herself.

In the winter of 1895, cold wind cut down the valley and damp air stayed in the rooms. Mingsheng came home from the fields coughing. Within days he had a tight chest and could not keep up with the morning work. His family kept him by the brazier, fed him thin porridge, and burned incense at the household altar. He could not sleep for the coughing. On December 27, 1895, the coughing stopped and he died in the house at sixteen.
