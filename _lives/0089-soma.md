Soma was born on December 19, 918, in a hamlet of mud-walled houses and thatched roofs near Gaya, in country governed by the Pāla order of eastern India. His mother Śrīmatī spoke the Gauda tongue from Varendra, and she kept the family’s older customs while living among Magadhan neighbors. His father had died the year before, and the household sat under the authority of Śrīmatī’s parents, Vāsudeva and Kalyāṇī, on a modest holding that still produced a surplus in good seasons.

Śrīmatī named the boy Soma and tied a black thread at his waist. She fed him thin rice gruel when her milk ran low after long days weeding and carrying water. At dawn she set a small clay lamp on a ledge near the cooking place and offered water, rice, and flowers to a household image. On market days Kalyāṇī took Soma on her hip to a nearby Buddhist shrine. She placed marigolds and a pinch of white rice before a stupa, lit a wick, and poured water from a brass cup while the monk Saṅghadāsa accepted alms and recited verses.

During the cool months after the harvest, Soma crawled on packed earth while women pounded grain and Mitra, a neighbor, shouted over the thump of the pestles. Late in February 921, after a shared meal and a day of work in the fields, watery stools started and did not stop. Kalyāṇī tried rice-water and salt; Śrīmatī kept offering sips, then could not.

On February 26, they wrapped Soma in cloth and carried him to the edge of the settlement. Vāsudeva oversaw the cremation on a small wood pyre, and Śrīmatī placed a lamp and a handful of rice beside the ash.
