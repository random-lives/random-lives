#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 42
#     connection: Begins after repeated winter infections during wartime-stress years;
#       reduces capacity for harvest work and increases reliance on kin and routine

#     incident: chronic_illness
#   - age: 46
#     connection: During the War of the Austrian Succession period she is often kept
#       to indoor labor; conflict-related shortages make recovery harder.
#     incident: chronic_illness (continuation/management)

#       role strengthens her place in the kin household despite her limitations.
#     incident: sick_relative
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-7
#     key_events:
#     - Born 1699 in a nuclear tenant-farming household near Milan; early language environment
#       includes Milanese Lombard and Ticinese variety.
#     - War of the Spanish Succession brings troop passages/requisitions anxiety in
#       the countryside (heard and felt through shortages and fear).
#     - Youngest sister is born and later dies (1706), becoming a formative household
#       loss.
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 8-20
#     key_events:
#     - Continues as a farm girl doing repetitive tasks; no schooling; inability to
#       read/write becomes apparent and normalised within peasant life.
#     - Family adjusts to Austrian rule and new administrative demands; talk of rents,
#       dues, and officials becomes part of home life.
#     - Marriage negotiations begin in late teens; Elisabetta’s limitations and temperament
#       make matches narrower but still viable locally.
#     phase: Later childhood / adolescence
#   - age_range: 21-35
#     key_events:
#     - Marries Giovanni around 1720 and moves only a short distance within the parish
#       area; settles into tenant-farm household routine.
#     - Five live births (1721, 1723, 1725, 1728, 1731) with three children dying in
#       early childhood; repeated mourning and church rites.
#     - Intermittent grain-price shocks increase pressure on the tenancy; Elisabetta
#       contributes through household production and seasonal field labor.
#     phase: Early adult / married life and childbearing
#   - age_range: 36-50
#     key_events:
#     - War of the Austrian Succession years bring renewed wartime burdens (requisitions/taxes,
#       passing soldiers) without full displacement.
#     - Chronic winter chest illness begins around early 1740s, shifting her labor from
#       heavy fieldwork to indoor tasks.
#     - Husband dies (c. 1749), making her a widow; she becomes more dependent on kin
#       and anxious about security.
#     phase: 'Midlife: war years and declining health'
#   - age_range: 51-60
#     key_events:
#     - Lives within the kin network rather than as an independent household head; moves
#       into a relative’s home (not her own children’s) for stability.
#     - Provides prolonged nursing care to an adult relative during 1753–1755 while
#       managing her own chronic cough and weakness.
#     - Dies March 2, 1760 (age 60), after years of seasonal respiratory decline; cause
#       not clearly recorded/remembered.

#       and a reference point for Elisabetta’s anxious temperament.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Limited autonomy and bargaining power; others (sister/husband/brother)
#       handle contracts and church/official interactions; she is kept to predictable
#       household and field routines.
#     scene: As a girl and later as a wife, she cannot follow multi-step instructions
#       for market dealings or tenancy accounts; she relies on others for measures,
#       money, and remembering obligations, and learns tasks by imitation and repetition.
#     timing: childhood through adulthood (most visible ages 8-35)
#     trait: Intellectual disability (lifelong, mild-to-moderate)
#   - consequence: Strained relationships from constant worry; increased dependence
#       on religious routine; heightened fear during wartime rumors and food-price spikes.
#     scene: After each child’s illness she becomes sleepless and vigilant, repeatedly
#       checking breathing by the hearth, interpreting ordinary coughs as omens; she
#       prays and seeks reassurance from saints and the priest.
#     timing: especially ages 21-35; resurges ages 42-60 with her own chronic illness
#     trait: Neuroticism (very high)
#   - consequence: Stays rooted in familiar kin networks; avoids novel work opportunities;
#       conflicts when others propose changes in farming practice or household arrangement.
#     scene: She distrusts new remedies, unfamiliar foods, or different parish customs,
#       preferring the same prayers, the same ways of kneading bread and tending the
#       fire; she resists any suggestion of moving farther away or changing household
#       routines.
#     timing: adolescence onward (ages 15-60)
#     trait: Openness (very low)
#   - consequence: Reputation as difficult; fewer supportive ties outside kin; reliance
#       on family rather than neighbors in crises.
#     scene: She is blunt and suspicious with neighbors, quick to accuse others of 'evil
#       eye' or carelessness when children fall ill; she quarrels over borrowed tools,
#       gleaning rights, and small slights at the well or churchyard.
#     timing: most visible ages 25-55
#     trait: Agreeableness (very low)
#   - consequence: Household work is serviceable but uneven; others step in for time-sensitive
#       tasks; increases marital tension during hard years.
#     scene: She forgets scheduled tasks unless prompted (e.g., setting aside seed grain,
#       keeping linens in order), leading to scolding from husband/older women; she
#       performs best with routine chores but struggles with planning.
#     timing: adulthood (ages 21-45)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (low)
# number_of_children: '5'
# number_of_siblings: '3'
# occupation: 'Peasant/tenant farmer’s wife: household manager + field labor (unpaid
#   family labor on leased farm, kitchen garden, seasonal agricultural work)'
# religion: Mainstream parish Catholic practice (Mass on Sundays/feasts, annual confession/communion
#   at least at Easter, daily prayers/rosary, devotion to Mary/saints, use of holy water/blessed
#   objects, household crucifix/images)

# - F
# structured_incidents:
# - event: After repeated winter chest infections, she developed a long-lasting cough
#     and breathlessness that flared every cold season, leaving her too weak for heavy
#     fieldwork and more confined to indoor tasks like cooking, tending the fire, and
#     mending.
#   reasoning: Surviving to 60 in an early-modern setting often involved living with
#     intermittent or chronic limitation (e.g., chronic respiratory disease after infections,
#     recurrent fevers/malaria, rheumatic pain), making a chronic condition a common
#     form of 'serious incident.'
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 42–60 (c. 1741–1760)
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: She spent months nursing an adult relative in the same house—keeping them
#     warm by the hearth, preparing thin broths and herbal infusions, and washing linens—while
#     the parish priest was called for confession and last rites during severe relapses.
#   reasoning: Multi-generational rural households relied heavily on women for nursing
#     care during prolonged illness and recovery; her later-life co-residence with kin
#     makes this especially likely.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 54–56 (c. 1753–1755)

Elisabetta was born on May 26, 1699, in a cascina outside Milan, in the countryside of the Duchy of Milan. Spanish officials claimed the land and collected dues, priests kept the parish books, and tenant farmers worked fields that belonged to others. Her family spoke the Milanese Lombard of the area and the Ticinese variety carried down through their Alpine kin.

Her older sister Caterina came first, in 1697. Elisabetta followed, then their brother Pietro in 1701. The youngest, a girl, arrived in 1704. Elisabetta learned early what stayed and what disappeared. In 1706 the little sister died at two years old. The women washed the child and wrapped her. Elisabetta watched closely and asked the same questions again and again, then stopped asking and repeated prayers she had heard without understanding their words.

When Elisabetta was small, soldiers passed through the countryside more than once. During the War of the Spanish Succession, men in the household spoke in short sentences about billeting and requisitions. A cart was hidden in a shed once. Grain was kept back when possible. Elisabetta followed her mother from room to yard to stable, doing what she was told when the instruction came one step at a time. If given two tasks at once, she did the first and forgot the second. Her mother learned to point, to demonstrate, to correct by moving Elisabetta’s hands into place.

She never learned letters. She could not keep numbers in her head for long, even small sums. She brought eggs to the door of the farmhouse kitchen and traded them for a pinch of salt or a piece of soap only when someone told her exactly what to accept and when to stop. She remembered places and routines. She liked the same path to the well and the same bench outside the church wall where the sun reached in the late morning. She disliked strangers who asked questions.

As a girl she worked where she fit: pulling weeds in the vegetable plot, feeding chickens, carrying water, stripping greens, and turning laundry with a stick in a tub. She worked best with a rhythm that did not change. If someone tried to show her a new way to do a task—new knots on a bundle, a different mix of flour—she resisted and argued. She had a sharp tongue when she felt pressed. At the well she accused another girl of cutting into the line; the quarrel ended with a shove and both of them called to order by an older woman.

After the war ended and Austrian rule replaced Spanish rule, officials came in new uniforms, and men in the village spoke of changed taxes and surveys. The practical meaning for Elisabetta came in her father’s tighter attention to rents and in more days when bread was thin and soup was mostly water and cabbage.

In 1720, at twenty-one, Elisabetta married Giovanni Bianchi, a tenant farmer with a lease on fields near her family’s land. The marriage joined two households that worked under the same landlord’s demands. Giovanni handled dealings with the steward and the market. Elisabetta took on the kitchen, the fire, the washing, and field labor when the crop demanded it. She rose early, crossed herself, and said the same short prayer each morning. She kept a small bottle of holy water near the door and touched her fingers to it before stepping out.

Their first child, Antonio, was born in 1721. Elisabetta kept him close, checking his mouth and fingers as if he would change while she looked away. Caterina visited and laughed at Elisabetta’s constant fussing, then helped swaddle the baby tighter and showed her how to tuck the cloth so it would hold. Elisabetta did not laugh back. She watched and copied.

A daughter was born in 1723 and died the same year. Elisabetta sat by the hearth and rubbed the infant’s feet until they cooled. She insisted something must have been done wrong—water from the well, smoke in the room, a neighbor’s carelessness. She blamed people directly. Giovanni told her to stop speaking that way. She continued, then fell silent when the priest, Don Lorenzo, came to speak with her and lead prayers.

Another daughter came in 1725 and died in 1727, after days of looseness and fever. Elisabetta stayed awake, holding the child and trying to force thin broth between her lips. When the child died, she scrubbed the bedding until her hands cracked, then scrubbed it again. A son was born in 1728 and died in 1730. After that, Elisabetta kept herbs hung in the kitchen—sage and thyme—because someone told her they helped with coughing. She pressed a blessed medal into the folds of each child’s clothing. Giovanni tolerated it as long as the work was done.

Their last child, Margherita, was born in 1731. Margherita lived. Elisabetta relaxed in small ways as the girl reached walking age. She allowed herself a pleasure: warm polenta with a little cheese when there was extra, eaten standing in the doorway so she could watch the yard. She liked the hour before midday when the hens settled and the heat rose, and she could sit to mend with the light steady on the cloth. She talked to herself while she sewed, repeating phrases she had heard from her mother.

Hard years came more than once. In 1733 grain prices rose sharply after poor harvests. Giovanni argued with the steward over dues. Elisabetta forgot to set aside seed grain one season, and Giovanni discovered it after some had already been ground. He shouted at her in front of Antonio. Elisabetta shouted back, accusing him of never telling her anything clearly. She held to that complaint for weeks.

In 1740 talk turned again to war. During the War of the Austrian Succession, soldiers passed on the roads, and men hid livestock in outbuildings at night. The household gave bread and straw when demanded. Elisabetta became tense at any knock. She checked the latch twice before sleeping. That winter, in 1741, she took a chest infection that left her with a harsh cough. The cough returned the next winter, and the next. By 1743 she could not work the heaviest days in the fields without stopping to catch breath. Giovanni kept her at indoor tasks more often: tending the fire, cooking, stirring the pot while someone else carried it, mending sacks, and stripping flax. She disliked being pushed to the side of the outdoor work and snapped at anyone who offered help as if she were helpless.

Giovanni died in 1749, after a short illness that kept him in bed and left the farm work to Antonio and hired hands. Elisabetta did not remarry. She stayed close to her kin. Antonio took on his own household and his own obligations, and he did not want his mother directing his wife. Arguments followed. Elisabetta accused her daughter-in-law of wasting flour and lying about quantities. The daughter-in-law answered back. Antonio ended it by sending Elisabetta to live with Pietro, her brother, whose household had room and a steadier temper.

Pietro’s home held other kin, including a nephew, Carlo, and Carlo’s wife, Lucia. Elisabetta fit into their routine better than into her son’s. She still went to Mass. She still said the rosary, fingers moving fast when she was anxious. In winter her cough returned with cold air and smoke. She kept close to the hearth and did constant small work: peeling, wiping, mending, turning the spit, and scolding children for muddy feet.

In 1753 Carlo fell ill with a fever that did not leave. Elisabetta became his nurse. She warmed bricks and wrapped them in cloth to place near his feet. She boiled thin broth and pressed it to his lips with a spoon. She washed sheets and shirts in cold water and hung them near the fire to dry. When Carlo worsened, Don Lorenzo came and heard his confession. Elisabetta hovered close, interrupting the priest once to insist Carlo had taken the fever after standing in damp clothes. Lucia told her to be quiet. Elisabetta refused and had to be pulled back by Pietro.

Carlo recovered, then relapsed, then recovered again. The nursing lasted into 1755. Elisabetta’s cough worsened each winter through those years. She remained useful indoors and stubborn about how tasks were done. She insisted on the same pot for soup and the same corner of the room for drying herbs. She fought small battles and lost others.

On March 2, 1760, Elisabetta died in Pietro’s house near Milan. Don Lorenzo recorded the burial in the parish register, and the household returned to its tasks the next morning.
