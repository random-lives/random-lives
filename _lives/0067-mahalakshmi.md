#     death_year: 912
#     name: Gauramma
#     narrative_role: Youngest surviving child; closely bonded in daily routines. Mahalakshmi
#       worries about leaving her motherless; other women in the joint family become
#       her fallback caregivers after 882.
#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 19
#     connection: First sustained pattern of recurrent fevers after settling into marital
#       household; worsens during/after pregnancies and flares during monsoon/post-monsoon
#       seasons, limiting supervision and increasing reliance on sisters-in-law.
#     incident: chronic_illness
#   - age: 22
#     connection: Mother-in-law Kesavamma begins visible frailty; Mahalakshmi takes
#       on bathing/feeding/cleaning tasks, aligning with her conscientiousness and increasing
#       household authority but also stress.
#     incident: elderly_parents
#   - age: 25
#     connection: Husband away on a long journey; festival crowds and increased comings-and-goings
#       allow repeated pilfering of cloth/grain stores. This intersects with taxation/toll
#       pressures and prompts tighter household controls.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 27
#     connection: Fall while carrying water near a tank/well; weeks of reduced mobility
#       shift caregiving burdens to other women and exposes the household’s dependence
#       on her management during Govinda’s absence.
#     incident: serious_accident
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6
#     key_events:
#     - Lives in natal joint household in a market-linked town/village cluster in Rayalaseema;
#       learns rhythms of shopfront and storerooms by observation.
#     - Witnesses (as a small child) the birth and death of the youngest brother (Somayya),
#       absorbing women’s ritual practices around childbirth and protection.
#     - Grandmother Nagalamma’s authority shapes household discipline; Mahalakshmi becomes
#       a 'quiet helper' child who anticipates tasks.
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 7-16
#     key_events:
#     - Father informally trains her in counting, measures, and memory-based accounting
#       for household stores; she becomes known in-family for 'quick mind' despite illiteracy.
#     - Exposure to periodic toll/tax demands and rumors of road insecurity; family
#       discussions about caravan timing and safe routes.
#     - Betrothal and marriage negotiations with a slightly higher-status merchant/landholding
#       family nearby; preparation for patrilocal move.
#     phase: Later childhood & adolescence
#   - age_range: 17-23
#     key_events:
#     - Moves a short distance to husband Govinda’s joint household (patrilocal). Learns
#       new house customs and proves reliability under mother-in-law Kesavamma’s scrutiny.
#     - Repeated seasonal fevers begin/noticeably worsen (chronic illness onset window),
#       complicating pregnancies and recovery.
#     - Two neonatal losses (872–873) shape her relationship with elder women and her
#       own devotional routines (lamps, offerings, vows).
#     - Birth of son (875) improves her standing and bargaining power within household
#       decisions.
#     phase: Early married adulthood
#   - age_range: 24-29
#     key_events:
#     - Husband’s longer trade absences increase; she becomes day-to-day coordinator
#       of stores, servants, and ritual cleanliness; caregiving for aging in-laws begins
#       to dominate time.
#     - Property-crime episode(s) during husband’s absence leads to stricter storage
#       practices, supervision, and reliance on male kin/agents for enforcement.
#     - A serious fall at the tank/well leads to weeks of incapacity; household labor
#       is redistributed and her anxiety about vulnerability increases.
#     - 'Final years marked by overlapping burdens: chronic fever bouts, elder-care,
#       and heightened insecurity from regional conflict/raiding rumors; she dies in
#       882 from a later accident (not detailed here).'

#     name: Malliya
#     narrative_role: Older brother who moves in merchant circles; sometimes protective,

#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 858
#     name: Somayya
#     narrative_role: Youngest infant loss; his birth/death is one of Mahalakshmi’s
#       earliest clear memories of ritual, women’s work, and fear around childbirth.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Earns quiet trust from father and later from mother-in-law; given
#       more responsibility over storerooms and servants despite being unable to read/write.
#     scene: She catches inconsistencies in a supplier’s oral tally and reconciles household
#       grain-oil usage by memory and mental arithmetic, persuading elders without written
#       accounts.
#     timing: Adolescence (age 12-16) and again in adulthood (age 24-26)
#     trait: Intelligence (95th percentile)
#   - consequence: Household stability improves during husband’s absences; also leads
#       to overwork and difficulty delegating, contributing to exhaustion during illness.
#     scene: 'Runs the household by routine: lamp-lighting at dusk, careful rationing
#       during price spikes, orderly storage, and strict task lists delivered verbally
#       to servants/younger women.'
#     timing: Married adulthood (age 17-29)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (83rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Reduces open conflict and protects her social standing; sometimes
#       suppresses her own needs, delaying rest or seeking help when sick.
#     scene: Mediates quarrels between sisters-in-law over work distribution and childcare,
#       using soft speech and face-saving compromises.
#     timing: Early married adulthood (age 18-23) and sustained thereafter
#     trait: Agreeableness (94th percentile)
#   - consequence: Improves household adaptability and trade-related savvy; can raise
#       suspicion from conservative elders until she frames changes as 'useful, not
#       improper.'
#     scene: Curiosity about travelers’ stories and unfamiliar goods; adopts a few practical
#       customs from visiting families (storage methods, remedies) while keeping core
#       rituals.
#     timing: Adolescence into adulthood (age 14-29)
#     trait: Openness (80th percentile)
#   - consequence: Heightened caution helps prevent some mishaps (tighter storage, cleaner
#       water handling), but increases insomnia and emotional strain.
#     scene: After neonatal losses and during fever seasons, she becomes vigilant—checking
#       children’s breathing at night, worrying about omens and household purity, and
#       anticipating blame if anything goes wrong.
#     timing: Age 19-29
#     trait: Neuroticism (64th percentile)
#   - consequence: Builds moral authority and trust; may create friction with a relative
#       who prefers quiet cover-ups or harsher rationing.
#     scene: Refuses to hide losses from elders after theft and insists on fair distribution
#       of household food during scarcity, even if it reduces her own comfort.
#     timing: Age 24-26 and during poor-rain years
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (72nd percentile)
# number_of_children: '4'
# number_of_siblings: '6'
# occupation: Household manager in merchant joint-family (domestic administration, childcare,
#   supervising labor/servants, household religious rites; de facto manager while husband

# structured_incidents:
# - event: While her husband was away on a trading journey, goods kept for sale and
#     household stores (cloth and grain) were stolen through pilfering by someone with
#     regular access to the compound—likely a servant or a neighbor during a festival
#     crowd—forcing her to report the loss to senior in-laws and tighten storage and
#     supervision.
#   reasoning: A merchant/market-connected household in an urban setting faced meaningful
#     risk of theft, fraud, or pilferage, and she likely handled household goods while
#     her husband traveled.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 24–26 (recurring pattern over several months)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: She suffered a serious fall while carrying a water pot on slick steps near
#     a well/tank at the edge of the town, injuring her leg/hip badly enough that she
#     was mostly confined indoors and dependent on female kin for weeks before she could
#     walk reliably again.
#   reasoning: She ultimately died by an accident, and in a household-management role
#     (cooking fires, wells, stairs/rooftops, animals) a prior serious non-fatal accident
#     is plausible; still, most people’s serious health episodes were illness rather
#     than injury.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 27–28 (single event with sustained recovery)
#   type: serious_accident
# - event: She experienced recurrent bouts of fever with chills and exhaustion that
#     came and went with the seasons, leaving her weak for days at a time and limiting
#     how much household work she could oversee, even when not completely bedridden.
#   reasoning: Chronic or recurrent conditions (malarial fevers, anemia, gastrointestinal
#     problems, chronic respiratory disease) were common and could limit activity without
#     being immediately fatal, especially across multiple pregnancies.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 19–29 (recurring pattern)
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: In her joint patrilocal household, she became a primary day-to-day caregiver
#     for an aging parent-in-law—helping with bathing, feeding, and toileting during
#     periods of frailty—while coordinating food, oil-lamps, and ritual cleanliness
#     in the house when her husband traveled.
#   reasoning: In a patrilocal joint household, caring for aging in-laws was a common
#     expectation for daughters-in-law; by her late 20s at least one in-law could have
#     become frail even if not very old.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 22–29 (sustained period)
#   type: elderly_parents

Mahalakshmi was born on March 5, 853, in a Telugu-speaking market settlement on the dry Deccan plateau, where Rashtrakuta officials collected revenue through local chiefs and toll stations. Her family kept a shop and storerooms; the house stood behind a frontage where bolts of cloth, oil, and grain moved in and out with the seasons. The household prayed in the Brahmanical way: a lamp at dusk, a pinch of rice placed before the household shrine, turmeric and flowers on festival days, and longer trips to the local temple when a vow had been made.

She entered a home already marked by loss. Two older brothers, Vikramiya and Nannayya, had died as infants before she was born. Her sister Ponnamma, four years older, took to Mahalakshmi early, pulling her along by the wrist to sit near the women pounding grain or folding cloth. Their older brother Malliya carried messages for their father and learned the routes out of town, and he sometimes returned with road talk—where the guards demanded extra, which ford ran high, which village headman had changed.

The senior woman of the natal household, Nagalamma, ruled the inner rooms. Nagalamma kept the storerooms under her eye, demanded that water pots be scrubbed, and scolded any child who left grain scattered for rats. Mahalakshmi listened and copied. She remembered where a jar had been moved and who had borrowed a brass plate. When her youngest brother Somayya was born in 858 and died the same day, she watched women hurry with heated water and cloths, then watched them wash the floor again and again. That night her mother Sridevi sat upright, hair loose, while Nagalamma set offerings: a lamp, a smear of turmeric, and rice placed with careful fingers. Mahalakshmi learned that the house could become quiet in a moment, and that women did not have the freedom to stop their work.

As she grew, her father Raghava used her in ways he did not use the other girls in the lane. He did not teach her letters; that belonged to scribes and temple boys. He did teach her to count without stones. She stood beside him as he measured grain with a wooden scoop and said the numbers under her breath, then repeated them later to her mother so the cooking pots would not empty early. When a customer claimed a bundle had been short, Mahalakshmi listened to the man’s story, then repeated back the order exactly as it had been spoken, including the detail about a blue border. Raghava laughed once, briefly, and told Malliya to stop interrupting her.

In 867 Nagalamma died, and the house’s balance shifted. Sridevi took the senior role in the women’s quarters, and Mahalakshmi began waking before sunrise to help sweep and draw water before the lane filled. She liked the minutes at dawn when the air was cooler and the shopfront was still closed. She chewed a piece of jaggery when she could steal it from the storage jar, then rinsed her mouth carefully so no elder would smell it.

Marriage negotiations came when she was fifteen. The family chose Govinda, a trader from a nearby town, and the match raised her standing: his household owned land as well as a shop, and men in his family sat with guild elders when disputes over weights and road fees arose. She left her natal home in 869. The move was short enough that familiar hills still stood on the horizon, but the household customs differed in small ways—where shoes were left, which day a particular shrine received offerings, how the women addressed the men’s sisters.

Kesavamma, her mother-in-law, tested her through work. Mahalakshmi answered by making the house run smoothly. She kept a spoken list of tasks, assigning oiling of the lamp wicks, grinding, and water-carrying with a steady voice that left little room for argument. When quarrels flared between women—especially with Ankamma, a sister-in-law who disliked being corrected—Mahalakshmi softened her words and offered face-saving choices. “Take the courtyard, and I will take the hearth,” she would say, or, “You give the rice; I will bring the water.” It settled people faster than open command.

Her first bouts of recurring fever arrived in 872. After the monsoon rains, she shook with chills at night and sweated through her clothes by morning. She kept the routine anyway until her legs gave way and she had to sit. A ritual specialist, Tirumala Bhatta, came with ash and a thread, and Kesavamma insisted on offerings to the local goddess at the boundary shrine—coconut, flowers, and a small coin placed on a stone dark with old turmeric.

That same year she gave birth to a daughter, Nagalakshmi, who died at birth. The next year she delivered another daughter, Ponnalamma, and that child also died. After the second loss, Mahalakshmi changed in small habits. She checked lamps twice, wiped the threshold again, watched the water jar for scum. She slept lightly and woke at small noises. She still laughed sometimes, mostly with Ponnamma when her sister visited and they sat together behind the house with roasted gram and gossip about neighbors. Ponnamma teased her for keeping too strict a store list in her head. Mahalakshmi replied that she did it because everyone else forgot.

In 874 her father Raghava died. News reached her with a traveler bringing cloth orders. She sat for a long time with her hands in her lap, then rose and asked Basava, the household agent, exactly which debts had been settled and which were still open. Grief did not remove the need for accounts.

A son, Rudrayya, was born in 875 and lived. The household’s tone toward her changed. Kesavamma’s voice grew less sharp, and Narasayya, her father-in-law, began asking her directly whether stores would last until the next caravan. When Govinda left on longer journeys, she spoke for the household in the inner rooms and passed instructions to Basava at the doorway, staying within the limits expected of her while still getting things done. She disliked idle visitors who lingered near the storeroom entrance and asked too many questions. She tolerated them politely and then moved the jars.

Mahalakshmi’s older brother Malliya died in 876 at twenty-five. The message arrived during a period of road insecurity, when talk of raids and troop movements had made caravans travel in tighter groups. Her natal household sent word through Kundayya, now a young man, and Mahalakshmi gave him extra grain to take back, along with a small cloth bundle for her mother. She avoided speaking of the death in front of her children until the household rituals had been completed.

A surviving daughter, Gauramma, was born in 877. The fevers returned in seasons, leaving Mahalakshmi weak for days at a time. She sat on a low stool and directed work with short sentences, saving breath. She drank thin gruel when her stomach could not take rice. When she felt well, she took satisfaction in small things: fresh sesame sweets on festival days, the clean smell of washed cotton drying on a line, the moment when Rudrayya fell asleep against her hip after she sang a simple household song.

From 875 onward Kesavamma’s strength declined. By 875 she needed help rising, and by 877 Mahalakshmi washed her, fed her, and cleaned her after she soiled herself. She kept the care private, sending younger women out of the room when possible. When Govinda returned, he thanked her once and then went back to discussing tolls and routes with Basava and Karimayya, a guard who guided caravans through risky stretches.

In 878 Ponnamma died at thirty-one. The loss narrowed Mahalakshmi’s circle. She still trusted Ankamma to watch the children when needed, but she chose her words with care. Her mother Sridevi died the next year, 879, and Mahalakshmi performed her household offerings with a more exact attention than before, placing rice and flowers in the same order every evening.

In 878 and 879 Rashtrakuta demands tightened in the region. The household met officials and paid tolls, and talk of provisioning and forced sales passed through the market. During one of Govinda’s long absences, in 878, theft began inside the compound. Cloth went missing in small amounts, then a measure of grain, then oil. At first Mahalakshmi assumed miscounting. She replayed each distribution in her head and found the missing portions. She confronted Kesavamma and Narasayya directly, reciting the sequence of jar openings, who had been present, and which seal string had been retied differently. Basava questioned servants, Soma the potter supplied new storage jars with tighter lids, and Mahalakshmi ordered that the keys and seal cords stay on her person. The pilfering stopped after a neighbor was caught carrying cloth under a shawl during a festival crowd, but the household never returned to easy trust.

In 880 Narasayya began to fail as well, and Mahalakshmi’s days filled with washing, feeding, managing stores, and keeping children from the sickroom. Her fever cycles continued. She worked through them, then lay down when her vision blurred. When Govinda returned he found the house running, the lamp wicks trimmed, and the storeroom cords neatly knotted, but he also found her short-tempered with small chaos, snapping at a child for spilling water.

At twenty-seven, in 880, she fell at the tank steps while carrying a water pot. The stone was slick, and her foot slid. She landed hard, pain shooting through her hip and leg. For weeks she stayed indoors, moving by dragging her foot and leaning on Ankamma’s shoulder. The household work shifted; jars were misplaced, and a servant burned rice once. Mahalakshmi gave clipped instructions from her mat until order returned, and she forced herself to walk again even when it hurt, because no one else held the routines in their head the way she did.

Narasayya died in 881. The men of the household reorganized obligations and discussed land and debts. Mahalakshmi listened from behind the screen and corrected Basava afterward when his oral tally of stores did not match what she remembered. She did it quietly, without embarrassment to him, and he followed her corrected count.

On June 8, 882, she died in an accident at the household compound after another ordinary task near water and stored goods turned dangerous. Her body was washed by the women, wrapped in clean cloth, and carried to be cremated, with lamp-lighting and offerings of rice placed at the household shrine before the ashes were gathered.
