#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-5
#     key_events:
#     - Born into a patrilocal compound under elders’ authority; early memories shaped
#       by women’s workspaces (hearth, grinding, spinning).
#     - Household experiences Neo-Assyrian demands indirectly (requisitions/corvée preparation
#       talk, measure-checking, fear of officials).

#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 6-15
#     key_events:
#     - Harsh discipline and food denial during scarcity months (childhood abuse incident)
#       while being trained for textile work.
#     - Imperial troop movements and requisition seasons create heightened vigilance
#       in the village; family hides surplus or rearranges stores.

#       an informal connector between women’s work groups.
#     - A theft of yarn and grain during harvest bustle (victim_property_crime) prompts
#       tighter storage practices and suspicion toward outsiders.

#     - Household’s status rises into local-notable standing through accumulation, alliances,
#       and visible hospitality/ritual generosity.
#     - Chronic respiratory limitations gradually worsen in later years (separate from
#       terminal decline until the end), while she becomes a senior caregiver and authority
#       in women’s work.

#     name: Pazur
#     narrative_role: Last infant lost; his brief life is remembered mainly through
#       the mother’s grief and the household’s renewed vows/offering routines.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds social capital that later supports the household’s rise and
#       provides early warning about officials, prices, and reputations.
#     scene: At the well and during communal grinding/spinning, Abigail talks easily,
#       gathers news, negotiates exchanges, and mediates small disputes between women
#       from different household branches.
#     timing: most visible ages 16-45
#     trait: High Extraversion (81)
#   - consequence: Protective vigilance helps in crises but strains relationships and
#       fuels conflict during scarcity.
#     scene: After children’s illnesses or rumors of troop movements, she becomes restless—double-checking
#       storage seals, counting grain, waking at night to listen for coughing or animals
#       moving.
#     timing: begins ages 6-10; recurs strongly ages 20-60
#     trait: High Neuroticism (83)
#   - consequence: Materially helps the household short-term but increases risk of gossip,
#       retaliation, and moral unease within the kin network.
#     scene: In bargaining, she is willing to shade the truth about thread quality or
#       ‘wastage’ and to keep back the best yarn for her own household line when pressure
#       is high.
#     timing: notable during economic stress, ages 30-40
#     trait: Low Honesty-Humility (33)
#   - consequence: Keeps her effective in textile production and social roles while
#       leaving formal negotiations/measure disputes more dependent on male kin or sharper
#       female relatives.
#     scene: She relies on concrete routines and others’ numeracy for complex accounting
#       of dues/pledges, but excels at procedural skill (spinning consistency, loom
#       rhythm) and memory for interpersonal obligations.
#     timing: throughout, especially ages 12-35 as responsibilities expand
#     trait: Low Intelligence (25) without disability
# number_of_children: '8'
# number_of_siblings: '7'
# occupation: Textile producer (spinning/weaving as main ongoing work within the household
#   economy)
# religion: Local West Semitic/Aramean household polytheism (domestic offerings, village
#   shrine/festival participation)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: A neighbor or passing drover stole a bundle of her spun yarn and a small
#     amount of stored grain from the household’s storage area while the compound was
#     busy with harvest work; the loss was noticed only after the goods failed to appear
#     at a planned exchange in the local market.
#   reasoning: Village households experienced theft (animals, stored grain, textiles)
#     and occasional fraud/cheating in exchange; as a local-notable household with movable
#     goods and surplus, she’d be a somewhat more attractive target.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 26–28
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: During a year of tight rations and heavy dues, she quietly short-measured
#     woven cloth in an exchange and kept back some of the best-quality thread, presenting
#     it as normal wastage, so the household could meet obligations and still clothe
#     the family.
#   reasoning: Small-scale norm-violations like concealment of produce, short-measuring,
#     or opportunistic taking were common in subsistence economies; low honesty-humility
#     increases the chance of at least one such act over decades.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 34–36
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime
# - event: A run of poor rains cut the cereal harvest, and the household fell behind
#     on dues/corvée demands; they had to pledge part of next year’s crop and sell several
#     goats to a local creditor to avoid losing access to their fields.
#   reasoning: Rainfed farming in semi-arid inland Syria faced periodic drought, crop
#     failure, and tax/corvée burdens; even households that later became local notables
#     could experience at least one severe bad period across 73 years.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 33–35
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: After two younger siblings died in infancy, her caretakers became harsher
#     and she was repeatedly beaten for small mistakes (spilling grain, failing at chores)
#     and sometimes denied food as punishment, especially during stressful scarcity
#     months.
#   reasoning: In a large rural household with high child mortality stress, harsh corporal
#     punishment and neglect during scarcity were plausible, but severe/ongoing abuse
#     was not the modal experience.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 6–10
#   type: childhood_abuse
---

Abigail was born into an Aramean-speaking farming compound on the dry side of the Orontes country, where the reach of the Neo-Assyrian kings showed up in measures, demands, and fear of officials. Her family kept the old household rites: a small clay stand near the hearth for oil and incense, a bowl for grain, and a place where a lock of hair from the dead could be wrapped and tucked away. Her grandmother Ninsun managed that corner of the house, whispering names while she pinched resin onto the coals.

Abigail arrived as the fourth child. Narya, the eldest sister, already carried water and watched the smaller ones, and she watched Abigail too, tugging her by the wrist when she wandered. Hamut, only two years older, made space for her on the sleeping mat and taught her to twist wool between wet fingers. Shima, born the year before, had lived only long enough to be washed and wrapped. When Abigail was a toddler, another baby, Tappuya, died. The women rubbed salt into the floor and swept it out beyond the compound wall. Rimta, Abigail’s mother, stopped laughing after that. She counted bread portions with a hard face and listened for every cough.

Yatna, Abigail’s grandfather, ran the compound like a work line. He set the men to the rainfed fields and the sheep paths, and he set the women to grinding, baking, and cloth. A visiting official could appear with an escort and demand a tally of sacks or animals, and Yatna wanted his household ready. He inspected storage jars and the mud sealings on their lids. Abigail learned to stand still when he spoke. Her father, Gadday, followed his lead: a steady man in the fields, quiet at the hearth, sharp when the grain was low.

When Abigail was eight, the year’s rains were thin. The older children missed meals so the youngest could have a little more, and then the youngest still died. Rimta’s hands turned heavy. A spilled bowl of cracked wheat brought a slap that knocked Abigail sideways; a missed chore brought a beating with a switch cut from scrub. Rimta also took food away, sending Abigail to sleep with an empty belly. Abigail started hiding bits of flatbread in her belt when she could, and she learned to chew quickly in corners. She watched adults’ faces for warning signs and jumped at sudden voices. Ninsun pulled her close at the loom and gave her small tasks there, where Rimta’s eyes were elsewhere: teasing fiber apart, wetting it, keeping the twist even.

Hamut died when Abigail was fifteen. The girl had been old enough to grind grain and carry water without spilling, and she had started to talk of a marriage arrangement. Then she got sick and died within days. Rimta washed the body and cut a piece of Hamut’s hair. Abigail did not sleep properly for a long time after that. She woke and listened for the scratch of mice in the grain and the movement of animals. At the well she talked too much, pressing women for news—who had a child with a cough, whose man had gone with a corvée team, who had quarrelled with whom. Her voice came out fast, and people answered because she was cheerful in the moment even when her eyes stayed tense.

At fifteen she married Hanan, from a household tied to her own through fields and grazing rights. The marriage brought her into his branch of the same village network, still within a patrilocal compound arrangement where elders expected obedience. Abigail took her mother-in-law’s instructions in the morning and carried them out in the afternoon, but she also made friends. She laughed with Eshmuni, an older woman with ritual knowledge who kept track of festival days. They sat together after the evening meal while the men talked, picking burrs from wool and sharing salted goat cheese. Abigail liked the first figs of summer, eaten warm, before they were carried to the drying mats.

Her first child, Mika, came when Abigail was sixteen. She kept the baby close, and she argued with older women about when to wean. Mika lived to nine and died anyway. Abigail scrubbed the sleeping mat and the baby’s cup and then scrubbed them again. After that she became strict about water jars and food scraps, snapping at children when they put dirty hands into a bowl. Two years later, she bore a son, Yashub, and then a daughter, Nariah. Those children survived, and Abigail relaxed just enough to sing while she spun, an ordinary work-song with a steady beat so her hands could keep pace.

She became, day by day, a textile maker more than anything else. She spun in the early light before the compound was fully awake, keeping her spindle balanced, listening to the sheep bells. She wove on a simple loom fixed to the ground, beating the weft tight with a comb. Her cloth went to clothe the household first, and then to exchange—cloth for a pot, cloth for a little oil, cloth for grain in a lean week. She paid attention to who paid honestly and who did not. She spoke easily to men and women at the market and remembered everyone’s kin ties.

When Abigail was twenty-seven, the compound worked the harvest hard. Men cut and bound; women carried and stacked; children chased birds from the piles. A drover named Qaynu passed through with animals and a story about trouble on the road. While the compound bustled, a bundle of Abigail’s spun yarn and a small amount of grain disappeared from the storage area. It came to light when the yarn was not there for a planned exchange. Abigail’s anger was immediate. She demanded to see who had been near the jars; she questioned a boy until he cried. She carried the missing bundle’s tie-string in her palm and stared at it, as if staring could produce the thief. Nothing came back. After that she insisted on tighter seals and kept her best thread tucked away where only she and Hanan knew.

Her childbearing continued. An infant son, Samu, died at birth when she was twenty-two. A daughter, Illa, followed two years later and died just as quickly. Then Padi lived seven years, long enough to chase lambs and drag a reed mat into the sun, and died after an illness that left him thin and thirsty. Another baby, Tala, lived a year. Each loss brought more offerings: oil poured on coals, a pinch of flour at the household stand, a small cup of beer tipped out onto the ground for the ancestors. Abigail did the gestures in the correct order, watched the smoke, and listened for the crackle that older women said meant the offering was accepted.

Her younger brother Zakkur grew into a strong worker and died at thirty-three when Abigail was thirty-six. Before that, he had been the one who carried messages between households and brought news of prices and officials. Her younger sister Ahiya died when Abigail was twenty-eight, leaving a gap at the well and at the spinning circle. Narya, the eldest sister, died when Abigail was forty-one; by then Narya had married and moved within the same region, and Abigail had used her sister as a source of blunt advice. After Narya’s death, Abigail took over more of the arguing and the arranging for her own household.

A run of poor rains hit when Abigail was thirty-four. The cereal yield dropped and the dues did not. Men talked about corvée teams and inspection visits. Hanan and the other men of the compound met a creditor, Barakku, and pledged part of the next year’s harvest. They sold goats to keep access to fields. Abigail responded with her own kind of calculation. When she was thirty-five, she short-measured cloth in an exchange and kept back the best thread, calling it normal wastage. She did it with a straight face and spoke quickly to distract the other woman, asking after her children and the last locust sightings. The household’s needs came first, and Abigail protected her own line inside the compound.

Her surviving children grew into adults. Yashub took on field decisions and handled men from other households with a calm face. Nariah stayed close to Abigail’s textile work; mother and daughter worked side by side, and Abigail trusted her with thread she would not have given to anyone else. The youngest daughter, Raqa, born when Abigail was thirty, stayed in the household network and became the helper Abigail relied on. Raqa teased her mother for talking too much at the well, and Abigail snapped back, then laughed, then told Raqa to keep her eyes open and her mouth shut when a stranger approached.

As the household’s standing rose, Abigail participated in it directly. She pushed for visible hospitality on festival days, sending bowls of stew and bread to neighbors and to Eshmuni, whose tongue shaped reputations. She kept cloth ready as gifts when a dispute needed smoothing. She also grew more controlling inside the compound, checking storage and scolding younger women over wasting thread. Her worry never left; it changed shape.

In her fifties she began to cough in the mornings. The hearth smoke bothered her, and she started sitting near the doorway after meals. In winter her chest tightened. She still worked, but she took more breaks, and she leaned on Raqa for the heavy steps of loom work. She became the one who cared for others: nursing children with fevers, washing an injured man’s leg, feeding an old in-law softened grain and broth. When Yashub died at forty-seven, Abigail ran the women’s side of the mourning and then went back to sorting wool the next day because meals still had to be made. Nariah lived past fifty and died two years before Abigail, leaving Abigail short of her most capable partner.

Hanan lived into old age with her. They argued about stores and about who owed what to whom, and they sat together in the evenings when the heat left the courtyard, listening to grandchildren talk. Abigail kept her offerings. Oil, grain, incense. A muttered list of names. She liked the quiet just after sunrise, when she could sit with a spindle and hear only sheep and a distant call from the well.

At seventy-three her cough turned into days when she could not finish a sentence without stopping. Her chest rattled and she could not keep food down. Raqa and other women washed her and rubbed oil into her skin. She died in the compound where she had been born and where she had spent her whole life. Her family wrapped her in cloth from the household stores and placed her in a grave outside the village bounds, setting a small jar of oil and a pinch of grain beside her and burning incense at the edge of the pit before sealing it.
