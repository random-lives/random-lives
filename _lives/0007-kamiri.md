Kamiri was born at the start of the dry season, when the grass in the cerrado faded and the nights cooled on the higher ground above the river bends. His family camped on a low rise near scattered trees in the interior of what is now northern Minas Gerais. Their lives ran along footpaths between waterholes, hunting grounds, and the outcrops where they took stone for points.

His father hunted with other men, not alone. When they brought in meat—deer, armadillo, and sometimes a larger animal pushed toward waiting spears—everyone watched the butchering and the division. His father’s hands were quick and exact. He took the best cuts last. People noticed.

His mother kept ties between camps. She traveled with other women and carried bundles meant for exchange: smoked meat, cordage, pigment, and small tools. She also carried the memory of two dead children. Her first had died soon after birth. Her second had lived through one rainy season and died before she could walk far.

Kamiri still received a name. At dusk the camp gathered in a broad ring. Feet struck the ground in time. Voices rose and fell in the songs used for births and mourning. His mother held him tight against her ribs while others danced around them.

Rains returned months later. The river filled and the air stayed warm through the night. Then Kamiri’s stools turned watery and frequent. Fever came after. He nursed in short pulls and pushed away. His mother tried to keep him at her breast and carried him everywhere, even when she went to fetch water. Within days he stopped lifting his head.

He died before his first year was done. At first light his mother sat with him until his body went slack and heavy. The camp fell quiet. The hunters moved out early, following tracks along the damp ground, because the others still had to eat.
