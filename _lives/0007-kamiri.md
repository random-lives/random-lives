historical_notes:
  - "For 365–364 BC in the interior/lowlands of Brazil (including northern Minas Gerais), there are no contemporary written records; any reconstruction for a person like “Kamiri” must rely on archaeology, paleoecology, and later comparative linguistics rather than dated chronicles or named historical individuals."
  - "The ethnicity/language fields (“Tupian-affiliated interior peoples,” “Tupian/Tupi-related”) are not securely datable to a specific century at this location: while Tupian diversification and a likely southwestern Amazonian homeland are argued from comparative linguistics, the timing/routes of expansion into central/eastern Brazil (including Minas Gerais) remain debated, so this label should be treated as a tentative inference rather than a fixed identification."
  - "The stated birthplace (≈ −15.83, −45.01; modern northern Minas Gerais, Brazil) lies in the cerrado with strong wet–dry seasonality, which fits the narrative’s seasonal shift (dry-season cooling/browning grass; later rains and river rise) and a mobility pattern focused on water sources and dispersed resource patches typical of savanna foraging landscapes documented archaeologically in central Brazil."
  - "Cause of death as an “infectious disease” (diarrheal illness and/or respiratory infection leading to dehydration/sepsis) is plausible for an infant in a small foraging camp without sanitation or antibiotics, but the specific pathogen cannot be identified from narrative detail alone and would only be testable with exceptional bioarchaeological preservation."
  - "The described birth/death-linked communal song/dance rite and naming event should be treated as an analogy-based reconstruction: such ceremonies are well attested ethnographically in parts of Indigenous South America, but the specific songs, roles (e.g., headman/ritual specialists), and meanings for 4th-century-BC interior Minas Gerais cannot be directly verified without clear ritual/burial context."
  - "The personal name “Kamiri” and detailed household prestige/kin-role claims (e.g., ‘close to headman/leading kin,’ specific parental specializations) are not recoverable from archaeology for an infant unless an unusually informative burial context exists; they function best as narrative placeholders rather than empirically established facts."

Kamiri was born as the dry season set in. The grass browned, and the nights cooled on the higher ground above the river bends. His family camped on a low rise near scattered trees. Footpaths linked their shelter to waterholes, hunting places, and the rock outcrops where his father shaped stone into points.

His father hunted with other men. They moved out before first light and came back with deer, armadillo, and, when the drive went well, a larger animal forced toward waiting spears. Butchering happened in full view. The cuts were counted out and carried off. His father kept his hands quick and his face flat. He took his share last, and he watched who looked away and who didn’t.

His mother kept the camp’s ties from thinning. She walked to nearby groups with other women, carrying wrapped bundles. She returned with new cord, red pigment for marking skin and tools, and favors owed. She spoke little about the two children she had already buried. Everyone knew the order of it: one who died right after birth, and one who lived through a rainy season and failed when she began to follow people on her own feet.

Kamiri was named soon after he came. At dusk the camp made a ring. People stamped in time and sang the songs used for births and for the dead, because the two sat close together. His mother held him tight against her ribs. His father stood at the edge with the other men, listening, letting the sound carry the moment for him.

When the rains returned, the river rose and the ground stayed damp. Kamiri’s stools turned thin and frequent. He cried without strength. He nursed in short pulls and then pushed away. His mother kept him against her skin and took him with her when she went for water. She tried to feed him again and again, even as his mouth went slack.

Within days he stopped lifting his head. At first light she sat with him until his body went heavy in her arms. The camp quieted and made space around her. The hunters left early anyway, following tracks along wet ground, because meat still had to come back before night.
