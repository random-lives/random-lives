#     death_age: 13
#     death_year: 1824
#     name: Harihar
#     narrative_role: Protagonist; a weaver-household helper known for calmness and

#       carrying bundles), with long stretches of fever and a serious fall that reduces
#       his usefulness.

#     death_year: 1822
#     name: Gadadhar
#     narrative_role: Younger brother and closest playmate; more lively and quick, often
#       acts as Harihar’s 'interpreter' with other children; his death leaves Harihar
#       quieter and more solitary.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Kept to low-skill tasks; fewer peers; family treats him as younger
#       than his age; increased vulnerability to scolding from uncle and to being excluded
#       from boys’ games.
#     scene: At the loom, he can repeat a single learned step (winding thread) but loses
#       sequence when asked to do two steps in order; other boys laugh when he misunderstands
#       simple jokes or instructions.
#     timing: visible from ages 4-5; persistent through ages 9-13
#     trait: Intellectual disability (global developmental delay)
#   - consequence: Adults interpret calmness as obedience or dullness; he is easier
#       to manage in crises, but his low outward distress can delay others noticing
#       severity until fever is obvious.
#     scene: During fever bouts and even after the fall, he rarely panics or complains;
#       he sits quietly watching the loom rhythm, appearing oddly calm when others are
#       distressed by epidemic rumors.
#     timing: especially ages 9-13 (illness seasons and after accident)
#     trait: Very low neuroticism (2nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Drawn to wandering near work sites and the tank path (a risk factor
#       for the later fall); occasionally scolded for 'wandering mind' but also gently
#       indulged by mother/grandmother.
#     scene: He lingers near travelers and dyers at the market edge, fascinated by new
#       colors, songs, and stories; he fixates on patterns and textures of cloth even
#       if he cannot grasp the full process.
#     timing: ages 6-11 (before illnesses intensify)
#     trait: High openness (81st percentile)
#   - consequence: Smaller social circle; dependence on one or two familiar relatives
#       (mother, Damodar) for social buffering.
#     scene: In group play he hangs back, following his younger brother rather than
#       initiating; after Gadadhar’s death he spends more time alone winding yarn or
#       watching rituals.
#     timing: ages 5-8 (baseline), intensifies after 1822
#     trait: Low extraversion (32nd percentile)
# number_of_children: '0'
# number_of_siblings: '3'
# occupation: 'Household helper in the weaving trade (simple preparatory tasks: winding,
#   carrying, errands; informal apprentice)'
# religion: Household Hindu practice with regular home puja plus village deity worship
#   (offerings at home/shrine; participation in local temple/village festivals)
# sibling_ages_at_death:
# - 3
# - 83
# - 8
# sibling_sexes:

# - M
# - M
# structured_incidents:
# - event: While running an errand connected to the household’s weaving work, he slipped
#     on a wet embankment near a village tank/stream and fell hard, badly spraining
#     his ankle and bruising his hip; he was unable to walk normally and could not do
#     his usual carrying and yarn-winding help for several weeks.
#   reasoning: Rural boys frequently faced injury risks (falls, tools, animals, water),
#     but a truly serious accident with weeks of incapacity is less common than major
#     illness episodes.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 11 (late monsoon season)
#   type: serious_accident
# - event: From about age 9 onward he had recurring bouts of “fever” with chills and
#     weakness—likely malarial episodes—leaving him pale and easily exhausted between
#     attacks, so he often worked only in short stretches and was kept to simpler tasks
#     in the weaving household.
#   reasoning: Endemic chronic problems (recurrent malaria with anemia, chronic respiratory
#     issues, intestinal parasites with wasting) were fairly common and could noticeably
#     limit a child’s stamina and functioning.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 9–13 (recurring pattern, especially after the rains)
#   type: chronic_illness

Harihar was born on March 13, 1811, in Nuagaon in Ganjam, in a rural Odia-speaking village under the East India Company’s Madras Presidency administration. His family worshiped at home and at the village shrine: a small oil lamp at dusk, rice and a pinch of salt set aside before meals, and festival days when the men carried offerings to the local deity and the women brought flowers and water in brass pots.

He entered a crowded joint household of weavers. His father, Mukunda, worked the handloom and dealt with buyers who came through the village. His mother, Nilambar, spun and prepared yarn, cooked for many mouths, and kept the household’s clay hearth and water pots in order. Harihar was the third child. The first boy, Bansidhar, had died before Harihar was born, and his name came up during offerings for ancestors. Damodar, born in 1808, was already a sturdy child who understood errands and jokes. When Harihar was small, he lagged behind other children. He spoke late and mixed up simple sequences. If asked to fetch a pot and then return it to the shelf, he brought it, set it down in the doorway, and stared until someone guided him. Chintamani, his grandmother, used patience instead of scolding. She gave him small tasks: holding the edge of a cloth while she folded it, or carrying a tiny leaf cup of puffed rice to the household shrine.

A younger brother, Gadadhar, arrived in 1814. Gadadhar ran ahead and Harihar trailed after him, copying his claps and games. Baikuntha, the grandfather, still held authority, and Harihar stiffened whenever the old man called across the courtyard. Baikuntha died in 1816. After that, the uncle Raghunath spoke more sharply about work and waste, and Mukunda began keeping tighter count of thread and time.

Harihar grew into a boy who liked watching processes. He sat close to the loom frame to see how the warp tightened, and he touched dyed yarn with his fingertips to see whether color rubbed off. He liked the market days best. Damodar took him along to the edge of the bazaar where cloth bundles lay on mats and where a dyer named Madhusudan hung lengths of damp fabric on a line. Harihar stared at indigo and red until Nilambar tugged his wrist to keep him from wandering. He did not push into groups of boys. He stood behind Gadadhar and laughed when others laughed, even when he did not grasp why.

Between 1817 and 1819, talk of sickness traveled with messengers and pilgrims. Kailash, the village watchman, repeated rumors of sudden deaths in other places, and some families avoided gatherings for a time. Nilambar added extra offerings at the household shrine—bananas when they had them, a few marigolds, and incense on festival mornings. When the rains came each year, mosquitoes thickened near the village tank and the low ground. Harihar fell ill more than once, but he recovered and returned to winding thread on a simple frame, turning the spindle with steady hands.

Gadadhar died in 1822. The loss changed the house’s noise. Harihar stopped following anyone into games and stayed near the loom, doing tasks that no one had to explain twice. That year and the next, with Chintamani gone in 1820 and elder authority weakened, the larger household divided. Mukunda’s family took one cooking hearth; Raghunath’s took another, in adjacent spaces. They still shared tools and sometimes grain, but the tone hardened. Raghunath complained that Harihar took too long and missed instructions. Damodar answered back and then pulled Harihar away before arguments grew.

The fevers began again in 1820 and returned after each monsoon. Chills, aching limbs, and days when he lay quiet while Nilambar wiped him with damp cloth and fed him thin rice water. When he stood, he tired quickly. Mukunda kept him on errands and winding, not on the loom itself.

Late in the monsoon of 1822, Mukunda sent him to carry a small bundle tied in cloth—thread and a note-mark for Jagabandhu, the intermediary who advanced supplies. Harihar took the path by the tank to avoid mud in the lanes. The embankment was slick. He slipped, fell hard, and came home with a swollen ankle and a bruised hip. For weeks he moved by hopping and leaning on walls, and Nilambar shouted at children to clear space so he would not be jostled. When he could walk again, he avoided that path and waited for Damodar to accompany him.

In September 1824, an eruptive sickness spread through nearby households. Spots rose on Harihar’s skin and his eyes reddened. Dinanath the priest came to chant and to mark the threshold with paste and ash; Nilambar placed a lamp and neem leaves near the sleeping mat and kept a pot of water beside him. He died on October 8, 1824, still unmarried, in the smaller partitioned household where he had spent his life.

Mukunda and Damodar carried his body for cremation, leaving rice and flowers and a lamp near the pyre.
