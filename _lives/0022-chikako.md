# father_occupation: Peasant farmer + regular estate labor obligations (corvée/transport/guard
#   work as part of dues)
# historical_context:
# - event: Expansion and consolidation of shōen (estate) control in the Kinai, increasing

#     proprietors (more corvée/transport demands, more disputes over rights).
#   timing: childhood through adulthood (1050s–1090s)
# - event: Intermittent Kyoto political instability and factional struggles (Fujiwara
#     regency politics and cloistered-emperor influence) indirectly raising extraction
#     and requisitions in nearby provinces to support patrons, temples, and armed retainers.
#   timing: adulthood (1070s–1100s)
# - event: Recurring regional flood/typhoon damage in the Kansai river basins (Yodo/Muko

#     death_year: 1078
#     name: Junsuke
#     narrative_role: Stillborn/neonatal loss; reinforces Chikako’s sense of bodily
#       risk and the household’s precariousness.
#     sex: M
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 17
#     connection: Occurs during visiting courtship with Tadakiyo; tied to market/festival
#       days and his estate work-gang schedule.
#     incident: premarital_sex
#   - age: 18
#     connection: Pregnancy drives a hurried acknowledgment of the partnership; sets
#       a pattern of insecure standing and dependence on others’ goodwill.
#     incident: pregnancy_outside_marriage
#   - age: 42
#     connection: Lean-season coping during increasing estate enforcement; foreshadows
#       later loss of plot and move into service.
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   - age: 46
#     connection: Triggered by Tadakiyo’s death and accumulated arrears; accelerates
#       after Masatsune’s earlier death removes a family advocate.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 48
#     connection: Occurs while carrying loads during estate labor; disability locks
#       her further into dependent lodging/service because she can’t compete for the
#       hardest fieldwork.
#     incident: acquired_disability
#   - age: 55
#     connection: Happens inside the estate-associated household where she is a lodger;
#       demonstrates low standing and insecurity even in 'protected' arrangements.

#     name: Umeko
#     narrative_role: Younger sister whom Chikako helps mind and carry; her death during
#       Chikako’s teens intensifies Chikako’s fearfulness and sense that households
#       can unravel quickly.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Reputation for being unreliable with obligations; worsens vulnerability
#       in estate enforcement and contributes to the slide into day labor/lodging.
#     scene: She forgets agreed work timings and misplaces small tools/cord, drawing
#       reprimands; she also struggles to keep track of what is owed and when, leading
#       to arrears and dependence on others to negotiate.
#     timing: Adolescence through midlife (ages 12-50), strongest during the debt/dues
#       period
#     trait: Very low conscientiousness (2nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Sleep disruption, strained relationships, and a tendency to accept
#       unfavorable terms for the sake of perceived safety.
#     scene: After children’s illnesses and deaths, she becomes vigilant about omens
#       (coughs, fevers, bad weather), seeks amulets repeatedly, and ruminates at night;
#       easily startled by shouting or official visits.
#     timing: From teens onward, spikes after 1066 (first child death) and again in
#       1090s hardship
#     trait: Very high neuroticism (93rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Fewer allies and less ability to bargain or seek communal help; reinforces
#       dependence on a single patron household.
#     scene: In village meetings she stays behind others, speaks softly, and lets a
#       sibling/spouse speak to officials; in the estate household she avoids gossip
#       circles and keeps to tasks.
#     timing: Throughout life, especially visible after migration and widowhood (40s-50s)
#     trait: Low extraversion (13th percentile)
#   - consequence: Short-term survival; risk of punishment or retaliation, and internal
#       guilt that feeds her anxiety.
#     scene: When hungry, she rationalizes taking brushwood/rice sheaves as 'what the
#       hill gives' or 'what was left to rot,' and she is careful to hide it rather
#       than confess.
#     timing: Midlife lean seasons (41-44)
#     trait: Lower honesty-humility (24th percentile) expressed as pragmatic self-protection
#   - consequence: Maintains access to shelter/food, but also invites exploitation and
#       makes it hard to demand fair treatment.
#     scene: She yields in disputes, takes on unpleasant caregiving chores, and tries
#       to keep harmony in the lodging household even when wronged (e.g., theft of her
#       cloth).
#     timing: Most visible in later life (50s) during service and daughter’s illness
#     trait: Moderately high agreeableness (62nd percentile)
# number_of_children: '3'
# number_of_siblings: '6'
# occupation: Agricultural day laborer/estate labor service worker (more dependent on
#   wages/corvée than own household plots)
# religion: Mixed kami rites + Buddhist observances (household offerings/prayers to
#   local kami; participation in Buddhist memorial/ancestor rites and temple festivals;
#   use of amulets/charms)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: While living as a lodger in an estate-associated household, a small cache
#     of rice and a spare hemp cloth she had set aside as part of her keep was taken
#     from the sleeping area; the household head treated it as "lost" and she had little
#     standing to press the matter.
#   reasoning: Petty theft and loss of goods were common in agrarian communities, and
#     as a dependent laborer/servant-lodger with few protections she would be vulnerable
#     to theft, wage withholding, or confiscation.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 53–56 (late 1090s)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: During a lean season she repeatedly cut brushwood and gathered fallen timber
#     from estate-controlled hills beyond what was permitted, and once carried off a
#     small bundle of dried rice sheaves left at the edge of a field to trade for millet.
#   reasoning: Land-poor households sometimes resorted to gleaning, illicit woodcutting,
#     poaching, or small theft to survive; her very low conscientiousness increases
#     rule-breaking risk, but opportunities and enforcement vary.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: recurring pattern, age 41–44 (late 1080s)
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime
# - event: After her husband died, she fell behind on dues and food obligations and
#     had to relinquish use-rights to a small plot; she entered service as a live-in
#     laborer/lodger on an estate manager’s holding in exchange for meals and shelter.
#   reasoning: Her adult standing is explicitly lower-status dependent labor, she was
#     widowed, and she ended life in a work-for-keep lodging arrangement—strong indicators
#     that she experienced at least one episode of severe hardship or loss of livelihood.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: sustained period, age 45–50 (early-to-mid 1090s)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: She developed a lasting mobility impairment after a badly twisted knee/hip
#     from carrying heavy loads on a muddy rice-field path; the joint never fully recovered,
#     leaving her with chronic pain and a limp that limited fieldwork and pushed her
#     toward lighter estate chores.
#   reasoning: Lifetime hard labor and untreated illness/injury could lead to lasting
#     impairment (back/knee problems, reduced mobility, partial vision/hearing loss),
#     but severe disability before 57 was less common than chronic illness without clear
#     ‘disability.’
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 47–49 (mid 1090s)
#   type: acquired_disability
# - event: She spent months caring for her adult daughter during a wasting illness—preparing
#     thin gruels, fetching water and fuel, and seeking amulets and temple prayers—until
#     the daughter died, after which she also helped with burial and memorial rites.
#   reasoning: In a peasant household, women were usually the default caregivers during
#     prolonged illness episodes; her later-life lodging/service arrangement also suggests
#     involvement in care work.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: sustained period, age 54–55 (c. 1100–1101)
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: As a young woman she had a visiting relationship with a man tied to an estate
#     work gang (transport/guard duty); they slept together before any household agreement
#     was finalized, with meetings timed around market days and temple festivals.
#   reasoning: Premarital sexual activity could occur in rural settings (including within
#     informal/visiting courtship), though norms encouraged linking sex to recognized
#     unions.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 17–18 (c. 1063–1064)
#   type: premarital_sex
# - event: She became pregnant from the visiting relationship before a fully recognized
#     union was settled between households; the pregnancy pushed the families to acknowledge
#     the pairing, though her status remained tenuous.
#   reasoning: She had three live births; some rural pregnancies occurred before a fully
#     formalized union, but pregnancies entirely outside a recognized partnership were
#     a minority.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 18–19 (c. 1064–1065)
#   type: pregnancy_outside_marriage

Chikako was born on February 1, 1046, in the wooded foothills and paddies north of the Inland Sea routes, in the Kinai region ruled from Kyoto by a court that rarely came to the villages except through documents, dues, and men with authority to collect them. Her people spoke a Japonic vernacular and lived with both kami and buddhas close at hand: a small shrine site at the edge of the fields for local protection, and a temple down the road where monks chanted for the dead and sold slips of prayer and simple charms.

Her mother, Kinu, died in childbirth. The house went quiet after. Her father Goromaru stayed in the house with the older children, and when he went out on estate duties—hauling loads, standing guard on a road, helping move rice—he left Chikako to her oldest sister, Yoshiko. Yoshiko was already old enough to carry a baby on her back and still work. She tied Chikako with a cloth sling, hoed weeds with short strokes, and stopped to rub salt into tiny bites of pickled greens so the child would eat.

Two brothers had already died as infants before Chikako could remember them. A third, Saburo, was born when Chikako was three and died before she turned seven. The household burned a little incense and set out a small bowl of rice gruel near the family’s Buddhist memorial tablet. Yoshiko kept Chikako from wandering into the room during chanting, not because it was forbidden but because the sight unsettled her and she began to cry and shake.

Chikako grew into a quiet child who kept near the edge of groups. At the water channel she waited until other girls finished and then filled her bucket. She startled when men argued, and when a stranger came down the path she counted what was in the yard and tried to decide what could be hidden. Goromaru could be gentle, lifting her onto a cart and letting her hold the rope, but he forgot what he promised. Some days he brought back a handful of dried fish from a passing trader; other days he returned with nothing but news about an inspector or a repair order for a dike.

In 1063, when Chikako was seventeen, her younger sister Umeko died at eleven after a short illness that left her thin and unsteady. Chikako had carried Umeko on her hip to the shrine site more than once, pressing a small coin and a few grains of rice into the offering box and clapping with trembling hands. After Umeko’s funeral, Chikako kept going back to the same place at dusk, placing a sprig of evergreen and whispering names under her breath as if listing them could hold them in place.

That year she began meeting Tadakiyo, a man attached to an estate work gang that handled transport and occasional guard duty. He came through with other men, sweating under poles, and sometimes he lingered at the edge of the market stalls. He had rough hands and an easy way of speaking that made it seem as if he was always about to laugh. Chikako did not talk much, but she listened, and she met him again during a temple festival when the precinct filled with smoke from cooking fires and the sound of bells. They started a visiting relationship. She slipped out when Yoshiko was busy and Tadakiyo was in the area. They slept together before any agreement between households was settled.

Chikako’s belly began to show in 1064. She could not keep track of small tasks even on ordinary days, and with fear pressing on her she lost things constantly: a cord used for tying bundles, a wooden scoop, a small knife she had borrowed and meant to return. Her father scolded her for carelessness, then worried about what the pregnancy would mean for dues and reputation. Tadakiyo’s work-gang ties gave him a place in the estate’s world, but he did not have land to offer. After tense talk between elders, they acknowledged the pairing in 1065 and treated Tadakiyo as her husband even when he was away.

Her first child, a son named Kintaro, was born in 1065. Chikako watched him for every cough. She warmed water on the hearth and kept the baby wrapped close even in summer heat. He died the next year. She set out a tiny pinch of salt and a few grains of rice at the memorial place and did it again the next day, forgetting she had already done it, then doing it a third time because she could not settle her mind.

Yoshiko died in 1069. She had been only twenty-nine, and she went quickly after a fever. Chikako’s bond with her had been full of small routines—sharing a bowl of millet at the door, washing hands at the channel together—and then it was gone. After that, Chikako argued less and asked for less. When she was told to do something, she did it, even if she did it late or in the wrong order.

Hana was born in 1073, a daughter with a strong cry. Chikako leaned on Hana in a way she never did with other people. She carried her to the shrine at planting time with a little rice cake wrapped in leaves and asked for protection. Tadakiyo was away often, and Chikako learned to manage without knowing what he had promised or what he would bring back. She sometimes lost track of what had been stored and what had already been eaten, and that drew sharp words from her brother Masatsune when he visited. Masatsune tried to keep the household straight with the estate managers. He talked fast, remembered dates, and did not like excuses.

In 1078 Goromaru died, leaving the family without its head. That same year Chikako delivered another son, Junsuke, who did not live past birth. The temple monk Shun’en came to chant, his robe hem damp from the road. Chikako put her forehead to the floor and stayed there longer than was needed, then rose and went out to move bundles as if motion would steady her.

The household’s position slid as the years went on. The estate’s demands tightened in small ways: more attention to boundaries, more men watching the hills, more insistence that each household provide labor when summoned. Tadakiyo’s absences stretched. In the late 1080s, lean seasons arrived, and by 1088 Chikako began taking what she was not meant to take. She cut brushwood from estate-controlled slopes beyond the permitted gathering and carried it down at dawn when paths were empty. Once she lifted a small bundle of dried rice sheaves left at the edge of a field and traded it to a middleman, Ichiman, for millet. She hid the millet under a plank, then forgot where she had put it and tore the room apart until Hana found it and laughed once, sharply, not kindly. Chikako’s face flushed and she slapped Hana’s arm, then immediately started apologizing and smoothing the girl’s sleeve.

Masatsune died in 1086. Without him, small disputes over a plot’s use or a missed duty turned harder. Tadakiyo died in 1089. He went out with men and did not return. Chikako received word and a small packet of his belongings. She could not keep up with obligations after that. By 1092 she surrendered use-rights to a small plot to settle arrears and entered a live-in arrangement on an estate manager’s holding. Hachirobei, the manager’s assistant, set her to hauling water, sorting chaff, pounding grain, and cleaning. Her sleep space was a corner behind stored baskets.

In 1094, carrying heavy loads along a muddy path between paddies, she twisted her knee and hip badly. She forced herself up and limped home, then stayed in pain that never left. The limp became part of her. She could not keep pace with younger workers in the fields, so Hachirobei shifted her to lighter chores, but he counted her rations closely. Chikako learned to make herself small. She avoided arguments, kept her eyes lowered, and laughed at jokes she did not find funny because laughter cost less than resistance.

In the late 1090s she saved a little when she could: a handful of rice wrapped in cloth, a spare hemp cloth she hoped to trade. One night the rice and cloth disappeared from her sleeping area. She confronted Hachirobei with halting words, then stopped when his face hardened. He called it “lost” and assigned her extra sweeping. Chikako did not speak of it again, but she began sleeping with her few items tied into her clothing.

Hana married into a nearby household and returned at times with news and small gifts: a bit of salt, a thread of silk, a scrap of paper charm from a temple. Chikako liked sitting with her daughter at the edge of the yard in the late afternoon, cracking soybeans with a stone and listening to gossip. Hana teased her for worrying too much, and Chikako snapped back once in a while, then softened and handed over the better portion of food. When troubled, Chikako walked to the shrine site with a cup of water and a pinch of rice, clapped, and whispered names—Kinu, Yoshiko, the babies—then went to the temple and asked Shun’en for a charm.

In 1100 Hana fell ill with a wasting sickness. Chikako moved to her side and became her caregiver. She cooked thin gruels, carried water, and cleaned soiled bedding. She paid for a chant with what she had: a small measure of grain and a strip of cloth. Shun’en came, chanted, and left a paper slip with inked characters. Chikako pressed it into Hana’s hand even when Hana’s fingers could not close around it.

Hana died in 1101 at twenty-eight. Chikako helped wash the body, arranged the hair, and sat through the chanting until her legs cramped. After the cremation or burial rites arranged by the household, she returned to Hachirobei’s place with her limp and her thin bundle, quieter than before and quicker to startle at coughs.

In early May 1103, a cold rain came and Chikako began coughing. She kept working until she could not catch breath without pain. Hachirobei gave her a corner by the hearth. The cough worsened into a chest sickness, and she died on May 23, 1103. The household carried her to the local temple grounds, where Shun'en chanted and rice and incense were set out for her spirit.
