Fátima Aguilar Romero was born on April 19, 2024, in Zapopan, in the state of Jalisco, governed by the Mexican federal republic. Her family belonged to the Spanish-speaking mestizo majority of the Guadalajara metropolitan area, shaped by wage work, church networks, and a city economy tied to national logistics and North American trade.

Her father, Arturo Aguilar, drove a delivery van for a local freight contractor. He left before sunrise and came back with dust on his shoes and a phone full of route messages. Her mother, Karla Romero, stayed home and ran the apartment on tight money: diapers, formula, laundry, and the daily walk to the corner store. They lived as a couple without other relatives in the home, in a busy neighborhood where traffic never fully stopped.

On Sundays they dressed Fátima in a soft headband and carried her to an Evangelical church service. Karla kept a small children’s Bible on a shelf beside pacifiers and folded blankets. In the evenings Arturo prayed aloud over dinner, simple words, short sentences. Karla answered and held the baby steady against her shoulder when Fátima startled at a loud motorcycle outside.

In October 2024 Fátima got her first vaccinations at a public clinic. She cried hard, then fell asleep in Karla’s arms on the ride back. In March 2025 she learned to sit without help and slap at a plastic cup on the tile floor. Karla keeps her close while she cooks, and Arturo sends voice notes from traffic. Fátima lives in a two-room home where Spanish fills every hour, and she spends her days on a foam mat by the window, watching light move across the wall.
