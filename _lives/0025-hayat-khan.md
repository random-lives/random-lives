Hayat Khan was born on July 5, 1572, in the thorn scrub country near Kashmore, where summer heat browned the grass and dust sat on every leaf. His people lived close to the edge of other men’s land. Some years the Indus rose enough to wet the low ground, but their own food depended on rain that often failed.

His father rented a small patch when he could and worked for wages when he could not. Nothing in the house stayed ahead of need. Hayat was the fourth of six children. Two died as infants and were buried before they had teeth. The older boys carried water, gathered thorn for fuel, watched goats, and learned early that a day without work meant a day without grain.

Hayat learned fast and talked faster. He could look at a field after a light shower and say where the seed would take. He could stack sheaves tight and straight and work a sickle quickly. He also forgot what he had just been told. He left tools behind and had to run back at dusk. He agreed to a task and drifted away when something else pulled at him. When his mother set him to watch a pot, he wandered to the well to trade jokes with other boys. She struck him for it, and he went back out because there was no other choice.

The Mughal state was a name that came and went through the village. Men spoke of Akbar and then Jahangir, but what mattered were the local revenue men and the village go-betweens who carried orders. They came with ledgers Hayat could not read and seals he could not name. Sometimes they took grain; sometimes they demanded extra labor, dragging men to pack earth on an embankment or to cut and carry for an official’s camp. Hayat watched his father argue until his voice went thin, then bend his neck and give what he could. Hayat learned when talk helped and when it brought a hand down.

By his late teens he lived on day work. At sowing he carried seed and pulled a scratch plough behind thin oxen. At harvest he cut until the handle rubbed raw and the skin split. He could outwork older men for an hour, joking and singing a line he had picked up at an urs, then stop in the middle of a row because his mind had run elsewhere. He turned up late more than once. He left early when he thought no one would notice. If a friend called him to some small errand, he went, even when he had been hired. Employers did not call him back after a few seasons. His carelessness cost other men too, when a team had to wait for him or a task fell on someone else.

His Islam was the village kind, tied to a pir as much as to the mosque. On Fridays he went when work allowed. In Ramadan he tried to fast, then broke early on the worst days of heat when his hands shook from thirst. He knew the prayer by sound and followed the row by watching backs. He carried a tawiz in a cloth pouch when he could get one, and when the shrine day came he walked there with others, touched the threshold, and pressed his forehead down with the crowd. He asked for rain and for release from what he owed.

He married in his twenties. The match came through neighbors who knew his quick tongue and his unreliability. His wife kept the household from sliding apart. She remembered who had lent them a rope and how long they had held it. She knew which woman might spare a pot of milk and which would demand it back before the sun dropped. Hayat kept disappointing her in small, expensive ways. He forgot to return borrowed things and had to pay to replace them. He spent copper on sweetmeats and tea when he should have brought home grain. He promised labor to a cousin and lost a paid day. When she was angry she did not shout. She stopped speaking to him, and he prowled the yard and lanes looking for noise elsewhere.

They had one son. Hayat wanted the boy to be quick like him but steady like other men. He barked orders, then changed them. He praised the child in public at the shrine fair, lifting him onto his shoulders so everyone could see, then struck him at home for forgetting a small errand that Hayat himself had not explained clearly. The boy learned to watch Hayat’s face and to keep his answers short.

Drought did not come once. It came again and again through Hayat’s middle years. Rain failed, then failed in a different way: late, light, and gone. On the rented patches the crop stood thin. Landlords still took their share. Wages dropped because every household sent men to the same few fields. Grain rose in the river town market, and meals shrank.

Hayat took an advance—grain and a few coins—from a patron’s agent. In return he owed labor at the patron’s call. It bound him tighter than he admitted. When the agent sent for him at dawn, Hayat sometimes did not show. He overslept after a night of talk. He wandered off to listen to a dispute in the lane. He went to the shrine to ask for help and came back late. Each missed day turned into another deduction and another order. When he did appear, he argued over how much he had already worked. His quick tongue bought him a little time and made the agent watch him harder.

By the years when people in the bazaar spoke of Shah Jahan, Hayat and his wife were living on the edge of a patron’s compound in workers’ quarters. The overseer could reach their door before first light. The patron’s men were polite when the stores were full and rough when they were not. Hayat tried to manage them with talk. He made a joke when he should have kept quiet. He promised extra work to cover a missed day. Then he failed to do it, and the debt grew into something that was spoken of as if it were part of his name.

Their son grew into a man and worked, then died at thirty. After that there was no adult child to take a share of the burden or to stand between Hayat and the overseer. Hayat did not become careful. He became more scattered and more dependent on other people’s company. He carried news from one courtyard to another and repeated what he heard without guarding it. Once he repeated a complaint about the overseer’s measures within earshot of the overseer’s cousin. The next morning the overseer came to his door and told him that one more loose word would cost him the roof and the little patch of yard his wife used.

Old age did not bring him rest. Men with sons could stay back to mend ropes, watch children, or sit near the grain. Hayat still went out because he had to be seen working, and because there was no one else to send.

On May 26, 1645, he climbed onto a wooden cart to steady a load of cut brush and bundled stalks. The ox shifted under the yoke, jerking away from flies. The cart lurched. Hayat’s foot slid off the edge, and he fell hard onto the packed ground. The men shouted and ran. He tried to sit up and could not. His breathing went fast and shallow.

They carried him back on a door lifted from its hinges and laid him on the floor of the workers’ room. His wife wiped the dust from his mouth and called his name until her voice broke. He died before the afternoon heat eased.
