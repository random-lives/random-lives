#   timing: adulthood (c. 260–304 CE)
# - event: Monsoon failure or multi-year drought affecting the semi-arid Rayalaseema/Deccan
#     interior, raising grain prices and causing seed shortages and livestock stress.
#   timing: at least once in adulthood (most likely c. 270–304 CE)
# - event: Localized crop pests and livestock disease episodes (worm/locust-like outbreaks,
#     cattle illness) that periodically reduced yields/traction power in dryland farming

#     sex: M
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 44
#     connection: Placed in 288 CE after a failed monsoon; links to regional drought

#   - age: 50
#     connection: Placed in 294 CE during grain division at the threshing floor after
#       a tense harvest season; contributes to chronic pain/limp and heightens dependence
#       on adult children.
#     incident: physical_assault
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6
#     key_events:
#     - Born (244) into an ordinary patrilocal extended household in a dry-farming village;
#       grows up amid household shrine offerings blending local goddess worship and
#       Brahmanical devotion.
#     - Learns early field-side tasks (scaring birds, collecting dung/fuel) and water
#       carrying in the semi-arid landscape.
#     - Family marks repeated infant deaths (older brother, later younger brother) through
#       vows and seasonal festivals.
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 7-15
#     key_events:
#     - 'Takes on heavier work: weeding/harvest help, grinding grain, caring for younger
#       sister; becomes socially embedded among women’s work groups (high extraversion).'
#     - 'Older sister dies (266) when Kamala is ~22? (NOTE: this death is in Kamala''s
#       adulthood; in this phase instead: heightened ritual participation and learning
#       women’s festival roles).'
#     - 'Younger sister dies at 14 (260) when Kamala is 16? (adjust: Kamala is 16 in
#       260; this event belongs at the end of this phase and pushes Kamala toward adult
#       responsibilities).'
#     phase: Later childhood and adolescence
#   - age_range: 16-30
#     key_events:
#     - Marriage to Soma (259, age 15) and short-distance move to his nearby village;
#       integrates into husband’s patrilocal household, working fields and household
#       production.

#       on women’s reciprocal labor and kin networks.
#     phase: Young adult / early marriage and childbearing
#   - age_range: 31-49
#     key_events:
#     - Continues as primary household manager and farm laborer; older children transition
#       into adult roles; adult son increasingly handles external dealings.
#     - Severe monsoon failure and debt crisis (ages 43-45; 287-289) forces loan-taking
#       and loss of a bullock/portion of fields, tightening diets and increasing work
#       burden.
#     - Depressive symptoms recur as exhaustion, withdrawal, and slowed work pace during
#       scarcity; family compensates by redistributing tasks.
#     phase: 'Midlife: household management under stress'
#   - age_range: 50-59
#     key_events:
#     - Physical assault at threshing floor dispute (ages 50-51; 294-295); recovery

#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds supportive ties that help during drought/debt years, but also
#       increases exposure to public конфликтs, setting the stage for the assault incident.
#     scene: Kamala organizes women for shared weeding and harvest singing, negotiates
#       exchanges of labor and grain, and is quick to speak in disputes at the threshing
#       floor.
#     timing: adolescence through later life (c. 255-295 CE)
#     trait: High Extraversion (72nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Improves household cohesion, but contributes to overwork and resentment;
#       during economic crisis she is more likely to accept hardship quietly, deepening
#       depressive episodes.
#     scene: She yields in minor household quarrels, prioritizes harmony with in-laws,
#       and takes on extra caregiving rather than insisting on strict fairness.
#     timing: early marriage and midlife (c. 259-290 CE)
#     trait: High Agreeableness (80th percentile)
#   - consequence: Helps her function in acute emergencies, but can mask the seriousness
#       of her depressive lows because she does not present as chronically anxious.
#     scene: In ordinary bad seasons she stays outwardly calm—steady voice, practical
#       steps, few displays of panic—while others catastrophize.
#     timing: throughout life, especially crises (c. 270-295 CE)
#     trait: Very Low Neuroticism (8th percentile)
#   - consequence: Creates friction with in-laws in tight years; during debt crisis,
#       disorganization worsens feelings of failure and feeds depressive rumination.
#     scene: She sometimes delays non-urgent tasks (repairing storage pots, mending),
#       relies on last-minute bursts before festivals/harvest, and needs reminders from
#       older women for ritual/household scheduling.
#     timing: adulthood (c. 265-290 CE)
#     trait: Low Conscientiousness (27th percentile)
#   - consequence: Household labor shifts to daughters/daughter-in-law; she becomes
#       more vulnerable to criticism and to being sidelined in decisions, increasing
#       dependence in late life.
#     scene: After child deaths and later during the debt crisis, she has weeks-months
#       of low energy, reduced speech, early-morning waking, neglect of grooming/food,
#       and difficulty keeping pace in the fields.
#     timing: first major episode c. 273-279 CE; recurrence c. 287-289 CE; smaller recurrence
#       after 295-303 bereavements
#     trait: Depressive disorder (episodic/persistent)
#   - consequence: Increases risk of disadvantage in debt arrangements; reinforces her
#       preference for trusted kin intermediaries.
#     scene: She learns by imitation and oral instruction rather than abstract planning;
#       relies on her husband/son for complex dealings with lenders/collectors and for
#       remembering exact measures/terms.
#     timing: especially during economic crisis negotiations (c. 287-289 CE)
#     trait: Lower Intelligence (28th percentile; not impaired)
# number_of_children: '6'
# number_of_siblings: '4'
# occupation: Household manager + agricultural worker on family smallholding (dryland
#   farming; food processing, harvest work, storage)
# religion: Mixed local-deity practice + Brahmanical/Puranic devotion (home offerings
#   plus participation in temple/pilgrimage when possible)

#     forced to borrow grain and seed from a better-off village lender, eventually surrendering
#     a portion of their dry fields and a bullock to cover the debt.
#   reasoning: Dryland farming in a semi-arid zone faced drought and yield shocks; widowhood
#     and child losses increase vulnerability to debt, livestock loss, or temporary

#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 43–45

# - event: During a dispute at the village threshing floor over the division of stored

#     her bruised and limping for days.
#   reasoning: Non-domestic assaults (neighbor disputes, market fights, inter-family
#     conflicts) happened but were less systematically targeted at women than household
#     violence; still, over decades in village life it remains a substantial possibility
#     given violence is confirmed.

Kamala was born on October 9, 244, in a hamlet on the stony flats and thorn scrub of the southern Deccan. The old Satavahana order had already broken apart. Collectors and petty chiefs came and went, and the village learned new seals and new demands without moving its fields. Kamala’s family spoke a South Dravidian tongue at home and kept household worship that joined the village goddess to the bigger gods named by priests.

She arrived as the third child in a house that held three generations. Her father, Konda, and her mother, Anka, lived with Konda’s parents under a low roof of timber and thatch. A grinding stone sat near the doorway. The grain bin stood on a plastered platform, raised from damp and rats. The first two children before her were a girl, Nila, and a boy who died in infancy in 243. When Kamala was small, Anka bore two more: Ponna in 246, and another boy in 248 who also died before he could be carried to the fields.

Kamala learned her place in the household by copying. She followed her grandmother to the shrine corner at dawn and watched the lamp being lit, the pinch of grain, the touch of water to the floor. Later she followed the older girls to the tank and the wells. The village lay in a dry belt. Water trips set the pace of many days. By six she carried a small pot and stayed close to the other women because cattle and boys moved fast on the narrow paths. She talked easily with people in line, asking questions, laughing when someone teased her for walking too fast and splashing.

As she grew, she stayed close to Nila and Ponna. Nila taught her how to keep millet flour dry in the rains and how to pat damp clay onto the storage jars so ants did not find the seams. Ponna copied Kamala’s steps and sat beside her at the grinding stone, pulling faces when the stone squealed. Kamala liked the first cool hours after sunrise. She ate a ball of cooked millet with a little sour buttermilk and chased it with a drink of thin gruel. When she was in a good mood she sang while she worked, short call-and-answer lines that other women picked up.

In 259, when Kamala was fifteen, Konda arranged her marriage with Soma, a cultivator from a village a few hours’ walk away. She went there with a small bundle of cloth, a pot, and bangles. Soma’s household expected her hands in the fields and at the hearth. She did not freeze in the new place. On the second week she joined the women for weeding and talked as if she had always belonged. That ease made the first months smoother.

Kamala’s first child, a daughter, was born in 261. She named her firstborn in the way her mother had, after an elder woman in the line. In 263 a son followed. Two more daughters arrived in 265 and 267. The household pressed her hard: nursing, hauling water, grinding grain, and stepping into the fields when the millet needed weeding and the pulses needed harvesting. She lost track of repairs. A pot would sit cracked for days. Cloth tore at the edge and stayed that way until someone complained. When Soma’s mother scolded, Kamala answered too quickly, then tried to soften it with a joke.

The rulers above them changed names more than once. One year a collector came with a new badge on his staff and demanded work on the road. Soma went with other men, cutting brush and carrying stone. Another year the demand was grain. Soma and his brother argued over measures, and Kamala watched them count and recount. She followed but did not hold the numbers in her head. When she went to the market she remembered faces and favors better than tallies.

In 266, news reached her that her sister Nila died at twenty-four. Kamala traveled back with Soma for the rites. The women shaved their heads and sat in the shade, passing water and rice gruel to those who could not swallow. Kamala did the tasks without panic, steady and direct, but she did not speak much on the walk home.

In 270 she bore another son. He died in 273, after three seasons of cough and diarrhea that passed through the village. Kamala washed him, fed him, and stayed awake beside him, and when he died she stopped rising before dawn. For weeks she sat with her back to the wall after the morning meal, staring at the yard while the day heated. When someone pressed her to move she moved slowly, as if the requests came from far away. The older girls carried water. Soma’s mother took over cooking on some days and complained loudly so everyone could hear.

A sixth child, a son, was born in 272 and died the same year. After that loss Kamala brought extra offerings to the shrine. She tied a small thread on her wrist after a village vow and kept it there until it frayed to nothing. She joined a pilgrimage to a nearby temple festival with her neighbor and friend, Suri, a woman with a rough laugh who liked to roast chickpeas until they popped. On the walk they traded gossip about marriages and mocked the men’s bragging about oxen.

Kamala’s eldest daughter reached adulthood first and became useful in every corner of the house. In 279 that daughter died at eighteen. The death came after a sudden illness in the hot season. Kamala did not wail in public. She sat, accepted water, answered questions, and then went quiet for months. She forgot to clean the grain bins before the rains. Mold got into a corner of stored millet. Soma shouted. Kamala did not argue back. She lay down in the afternoon and did not get up until someone dragged her to the hearth.

By the late 280s, her son Ravi handled more and more of the outside matters. He spoke to collectors, bargained for iron tools, and arranged labor exchanges. In 288 the monsoon failed. The millet heads stayed thin and pale. The household ate their seed stock. Soma and Ravi went to Bhaira, a wealthier cultivator who lent grain at hard terms. Bhaira’s men measured out the loan and marked the obligation with witness words. Kamala listened and nodded but did not grasp how quickly the debt would grow. In 289, after the second bad season, they surrendered a portion of their dry fields and one bullock to cover what they owed. Losing the bullock meant less traction and more hand work. Kamala’s shoulders ached. She moved slower and spoke less. Some mornings she left the hearth unlit and sat in the yard until Suri came to pull her up by the arm and press a cup into her hands.

In 294, after a tense harvest, a dispute broke out at the threshing floor over stored grain. Kamala argued for her household’s share. A neighbor’s kinsman, Uruva, stepped in and struck her with a stick. Another man kicked her as she fell. She got up with help, her leg stiff and her ribs bruised. She limped for days. After that she avoided the threshing floor and sent a younger woman in her place. The limp never fully left.

In 295 Ravi died at thirty-two. He had taken a fever after returning from a work demand on a local road and did not recover. Without him, Soma dealt with the village alone. In 296 Soma died, and Kamala became a widow. She stayed in the extended household that Ravi had built, now run by Ravi’s widow, Mara, and the grandchildren who filled the courtyard. Kamala still ground grain and watched children, but she rested more, sitting in the shade with a basket of pods and snapping them open one by one. She talked to the grandchildren when they hovered near her, and she told them to bring her a handful of tamarind when they climbed the trees.

In 303 her daughter Kanni died at thirty-six. The news came from the nearby village where Kanni had married. Kamala received it without shouting. She sat down, then stood and went to the shrine corner to light the lamp with hands that did not shake. For days she ate little and spoke only when someone addressed her first.

In July 304 a respiratory sickness moved through the households. Kamala coughed and developed a steady fever. Mara boiled herbs and brought water. Kamala stopped taking food, then stopped taking water. On August 5, 304, she died in the house where her grandchildren slept on mats by the hearth.
