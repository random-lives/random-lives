# narrative_plan:
#   caretakers:

#     narrative_role: Runs a small nonfarm business (shop/service) and is busy but present;

#       but practical—praise comes when Aditya is 'well-behaved' and cooperative.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Sunita
#     narrative_role: Primary emotional anchor and daily caretaker; models hospitality
#       and de-escalation. She leans on Aditya to be the sensible, non-troublesome child,
#       reinforcing his extreme agreeableness.
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Shantabai
#     narrative_role: Household authority in the patrilocal home; runs routine (meals,
#       prayer, festivals) and transmits religious practice. Close but sometimes critical;
#       Aditya tries hard to please her.
#     role: paternal grandmother
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Dattatray
#     narrative_role: Provides stability and village/town social connections; teaches
#       practical skills and encourages calmness. Generally affectionate; acts as a
#       buffer during family tensions.
#     role: paternal grandfather
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 19
#     connection: Occurs soon after Aditya shifts from village life to a nearby Vidarbha
#       town for studies/early work; it’s one of his first 'city lessons' about crowds
#       and petty crime and prompts the family to stress caution and budgeting.
#     incident: victim_property_crime (smartphone stolen; police complaint; replacement
#       SIM/phone)
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Rakesh
#     prominence: age 8–16; highlights Aditya’s agreeableness (peacemaker role) and
#       early social standing
#     relationship: school friend/benchmate in the village; later intermittent contact
#   - name: Priya
#     prominence: age 16–19; shows low conscientiousness vs. desire to please others
#     relationship: tuition class mate in the nearby town; helps him build study routine
#   - name: Imran
#     prominence: age 18–22; involved in the aftermath of the phone-theft incident and
#       trust/values conflicts tied to honesty-humility
#     relationship: roommate/colleague during early town life
#   - name: Patil Saheb
#     prominence: age 6–14; provides community context and the pull toward short-distance
#       migration
#     relationship: local customer/neighbor who frequents the father’s business and
#       gossips about town opportunities
#   siblings:
#   - birth_year: 2024
#     death_age: null
#     death_year: null
#     name: Vedant
#     narrative_role: Younger brother and early companion; Aditya is protective and
#       overly accommodating, often giving up toys/attention to keep peace, which becomes
#       a family pattern (Aditya as the 'adjusting' older child).
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Teachers and elders label him 'adjusting' and dependable; he gains
#       social protection but also becomes an easy target for minor exploitation (classmates
#       borrowing things and not returning them).
#     scene: As a school-age child, he routinely mediates playground disputes by giving
#       up his turn and persuading other kids to share; at home he offers the first
#       piece of prasad to elders and apologizes quickly even when not at fault.
#     timing: age 6–12
#     trait: Agreeableness (100th percentile)
#   - consequence: Creates quiet friction with a close friend and later a roommate;
#       he avoids fights but must repair trust through apologies and corrective actions.
#     scene: 'In adolescence he becomes status-conscious: exaggerates achievements,
#       curates a flattering online persona, and occasionally uses ''shortcuts'' (e.g.,
#       taking credit in group work or keeping extra change from a small errand) while
#       still avoiding open confrontation.'
#     timing: age 13–20
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (12th percentile)
#   - consequence: Average-to-good results but uneven; family pushes him into structured
#       routines (tuition classes, checklists), which he resists then adopts when stakes
#       rise (college/job).
#     scene: He procrastinates on homework and exam prep, relying on last-minute study
#       and help from friends/tuition; he forgets small responsibilities in the family
#       business unless reminded.
#     timing: age 10–22
#     trait: Conscientiousness (25th percentile)
#   - consequence: Motivates the move to town for education/work and expands his social
#       network; also increases time on phone/internet, which ties into the later theft
#       incident.
#     scene: He is drawn to new ideas and media beyond the village—science videos, Marathi
#       literature/poetry, experimenting with tech; he’s curious about people outside
#       his caste/local circle and enjoys city life’s variety.
#     timing: age 8–19
#     trait: Openness (77th percentile)
#   - consequence: Makes him cautious and sensitive to criticism; he avoids risky confrontations
#       and leans on family support and familiar rituals.
#     scene: Before exams or family financial stress periods, he gets stomach aches,
#       sleep disturbance, and reassurance-seeking; he calms down after routines (prayer,
#       talking to mother) and doesn’t show persistent impairment.
#     timing: age 9–18
#     trait: Neuroticism (64th percentile) without diagnosable disorder
# number_of_siblings: '1'
# religion: Hindu household puja + major festivals + occasional temple visits (typical
#   village practice; includes local gramdevata/Maruti devotion)
# sibling_ages_at_death:
# - alive
# sibling_sexes:
# - M
# structured_incidents:
# - event: While living in a nearby Vidarbha town for education/work and commuting by
#     two-wheeler/public transport, his smartphone was stolen from his pocket in a crowded
#     market/bus-stand area; he filed a basic police complaint and had to replace the
#     phone and SIM.
#   reasoning: Petty theft (phone/bike), scams, and shop-related pilferage are fairly
#     common in Indian towns; as someone likely to travel and interact in markets, the
#     chance of at least one such incident over a lifetime is substantial.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 18–22 (late teens/early 20s, soon after moving to town)
#   type: victim_property_crime

Aditya was born on May 28, 2021, in Pimpalkhunta Mahadeo in Buldhana district, Maharashtra, under India’s national government and Maharashtra’s state administration. His family spoke Marathi at home and lived as Hindus with his paternal grandparents Shantabai and Dattatray in the same courtyard house.

The first years were shaped by COVID-19 rules. His father, Mahesh, kept a small shop running with shortened hours and sanitizer bottles on the counter; his mother, Sunita, managed the house and quieted Aditya when he grew restless indoors. Shantabai kept the daily routine steady. A small shrine near the kitchen held framed pictures and a brass lamp; Sunita lit a diya in the mornings, placed flowers, and offered a pinch of sugar and a banana before the family ate. On Tuesdays Shantabai insisted on a quick visit to the Hanuman image at the edge of the lane, with coconuts broken on festival days.

Aditya learned to smooth things over early. When older cousins grabbed his toy car, he handed it over and went to fetch something else instead of shouting. At school he gave up his spot in line and tried to settle arguments by promising to share his tiffin. Teachers liked him for that. Classmates also learned they could borrow his pencil box and return it late.

Heat waves came hard in his early childhood. The afternoons moved indoors, and Dattatray slept near the fan, reminding Aditya to fill the earthen pot and drink water. In 2024, Vedant was born. Aditya hovered close to the cradle, bringing Sunita diapers and a steel tumbler of water, then stepping back when Shantabai clicked her tongue and told him not to crowd the baby.

By 2025, Aditya recognizes a few Marathi letters and can trace his name. He helps Mahesh count change at the shop, sometimes losing focus and needing reminders. In the evenings he sits on the floor beside Vedant, showing him picture books while Sunita folds clothes and the incense smoke from the shrine drifts into the room.
