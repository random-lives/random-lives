# father_occupation: Estate/contract labor (e.g., road/rail/earthwork, porterage) on
#   a recurring basis
# historical_context:
# - event: Colonial land revenue and tenancy regime (zamindari/intermediaries, rent
#     extraction, debt ties to mahajans) shaping sharecropping terms and vulnerability
#     to arrears/foreclosure.
#   timing: Childhood through adulthood (1901–1941)
# - event: Forest/estate administration in the Jungle Mahals (restrictions on timber,
#     grazing, shifting cultivation, and collection of forest produce; enforcement by
#     guards/police), altering how Adivasi households accessed subsistence resources.
#   timing: Most of life, especially working ages (c. 1915–1941)
# - event: Major malaria burden in Bengal with periodic severe seasons (monsoon-related
#     surges, localized epidemics) affecting labor availability, household productivity,
#     and mortality risk.
#   timing: Repeated episodes across life; highest seasonal impact annually (1901–1941)
# - event: 1918–1919 influenza pandemic (and subsequent respiratory disease waves) reaching
#     Bengal, causing widespread illness and excess deaths even in rural areas.
#   timing: Age 17–18 (1918–1919)
# - event: Non-cooperation/civil disobedience and intensified nationalist politics in
#     Bengal (boycotts, policing, arrests, occasional local unrest) increasing state
#     presence and tensions in rural districts.
#   timing: Age 19–33 (c. 1920–1934), with later reverberations
# - event: 'Great Depression-era price and wage shocks: falling agricultural prices
#     and tighter rural credit, increasing debt pressure and pushing more reliance on
#     wage/contract work.'
#   timing: Age 28–34 (c. 1929–1935)
# - event: Monsoon variability (localized droughts/floods) causing intermittent rice
#     shortfalls and wage swings in western Bengal; periodic crop stress affecting food
#     security.
#   timing: Intermittent across life; most salient in bad monsoon years (1901–1941)
# household_social_status: Poor/landless or near-landless (mainly laboring/forest work;

#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: 1931
#     name: Rupa
#     narrative_role: Contract/estate laborer with periodic absences; values toughness
#       and compliance. Relationship with Joga is mixed—pride in Joga's competence,
#       but frequent scolding and occasional harsh discipline; death forces Joga into
#       household leadership earlier.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: 1938
#     name: Phulo
#     narrative_role: 'Domestic work plus regular agricultural wage labor; emotionally

#     death_age: 41
#     death_year: 1968
#     name: Sukri
#     narrative_role: Only surviving child; central bond in Joga's later life. He invests
#       in her marriage prospects and security, and his early death leaves her with
#       the burden of negotiating support from uncles and community.
#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 18
#     connection: Occurs after grandfather's death and near the influenza years; seasonal
#       dances/festivals provide rare privacy and social mixing before marriage negotiations
#       with Hira begin.
#     incident: premarital_sex
#   - age: 25
#     connection: Happens during early married years while trying to recover from infant-loss
#       costs; pushes him to seek help from brothers and reinforces his later insistence
#       on careful planning and reciprocal obligations.
#     incident: serious_accident
#   - age: 30
#     connection: Falls in the early Depression squeeze when he is juggling rent/share
#       payments and an advance; the beating hardens his mistrust of agents/lenders
#       and shapes his later tactics for securing land access.
#     incident: physical_assault
#   - age: 34
#     connection: Tied to a period of road/earthwork away from home to manage debt;
#       strains marriage trust and increases the risk of rumors that he must manage
#       through gifts and strategic politeness.
#     incident: extramarital_sex
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6
#     key_events:
#     - Born into an extended compound with paternal grandparents; early years shaped
#       by repeated child deaths in the family and constant labor demands on adults.
#     - Learns household and field tasks early (herding, water-carrying, watching younger
#       children) while mother works for wages.
#     - Seasonal fevers are routine; family leans on mixed Santal/Hindu village rituals
#       for protection.
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 7-19
#     key_events:
#     - Grandfather dies (1912), increasing dependence on older brothers and father;
#       Joga becomes observant and careful, trying to avoid punishment and waste.
#     - Forest/estate controls tighten in practice (guards, fines), shaping how the
#       household gathers fuelwood and side income.
#     - Influenza years (1918-1919) bring fear and labor disruption; grandmother dies
#       around 1920, marking the end of the 'old' household order.
#     phase: Later childhood / adolescence
#   - age_range: 20-28
#     key_events:
#     - Marriage to Hira (1921); transition into nuclear household ambitions despite
#       broader kin nearby.
#     - First child dies in infancy (1923); intensified borrowing and ritual responses.
#     - 'Works mixed livelihood: marginal cultivation/sharecropping plus seasonal side
#       work (wood cutting, contract labor) to stabilize food supply; surviving daughter
#       born (1927).'
#     phase: Young adult
#   - age_range: 29-40
#     key_events:
#     - Depression-era price/wage squeeze (c. 1929-1935) increases debt pressure; Joga
#       becomes more calculating with advances, grain storage, and obligations.
#     - Father dies (1931), making Joga a key decision-maker; he consolidates a more
#       secure smallholding position through tenancy/share arrangements and careful
#       bargaining.
#     - Mother declines and dies (1938); by early WWII years, malaria seasons worsen;
#       Joga dies in 1941 during a severe fever episode.
#     phase: Mature adult

#     death_age: 69
#     death_year: 1973
#     name: Jatra
#     narrative_role: Youngest brother; as boys, he follows Joga closely. In adulthood
#       he becomes the key person Joga leans on for labor exchange and later for caring
#       for elders/household continuity.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Gradual upward mobility into a more secure smallholder position;
#       also breeds suspicion from others who feel he is 'too clever.'
#     scene: He mentally tracks grain owed, advances taken, and share splits without
#       writing, catching small cheating attempts at the haat and renegotiating terms
#       calmly.
#     timing: From late teens through mature adulthood (c. 1918–1941)
#     trait: Intelligence (92nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Better yields and reliability with landlords/tenancy partners; occasional
#       household friction when others want to rest or join festivals.
#     scene: Before monsoon planting he organizes seed, repairs bunds, and sets strict
#       routines for weeding and guarding fields, pushing family to keep schedules even
#       when tired.
#     timing: Especially visible after marriage (1921 onward)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (78th percentile)
#   - consequence: Fewer allies in open conflict (worsening vulnerability during the
#       market assault), but also fewer needless quarrels and gossip exposure.
#     scene: He stays at the edge of dances and meetings, speaks little, avoids public
#       disputes, and prefers one-on-one bargaining rather than group decisions.
#     timing: Adolescence through adulthood
#     trait: Low Extraversion (27th percentile)
#   - consequence: Builds reciprocal support networks crucial after his accident and
#       during caregiving; can be exploited by agents until he learns firmer limits.
#     scene: He routinely lends labor or a small measure of grain to kin/neighbors and
#       uses conciliatory language to de-escalate disputes—until a boundary is crossed.
#     timing: Throughout adulthood
#     trait: High Agreeableness (71st percentile)
#   - consequence: Helps him maneuver within exploitative systems (small gains, reduced
#       dues) but risks reputational damage and conflict (rumors, the haat dispute turning
#       violent).
#     scene: He withholds information about true yields, flatters officials/agents while
#       privately planning to underreport obligations, and justifies discreet affairs
#       when away for work.
#     timing: Emerges in late teens; most consequential in 1930s
#     trait: Low Honesty-Humility (12th percentile)
#   - consequence: Resilience and decisiveness; also a tendency to downplay emotional
#       needs of spouse/kin.
#     scene: During fever seasons and after losses he appears steady and pragmatic—he
#       acts (seeks remedies, reallocates labor) rather than ruminating or panicking.
#     timing: After early family deaths and especially in the 1930s stress period
#     trait: Low Neuroticism (30th percentile)
#   - consequence: Stability and focus; occasional missed opportunities for broader
#       networks or schooling for the child.
#     scene: He is cautious about new religious teachings or distant political talk,
#       preferring tested rituals and practical advice; he adopts innovations only if
#       they clearly improve yields or reduce dues.
#     timing: Adulthood (1920s–1941)
#     trait: Lower Openness (38th percentile)
# number_of_children: '2'
# number_of_siblings: '7'
# occupation: Sharecropper/marginal cultivator (tiny plot + laboring; but cultivation
#   seen as primary)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: A dispute at a weekly haat (market) over a sharecropping payment and an advance
#     he owed escalated; he was set upon by two men connected to the lender/agent and
#     beaten with fists and a lathi, leaving him bruised and unable to work for several
#     days but not permanently injured.
#   reasoning: Disputes over wages, land boundaries, drinking, or market/road encounters
#     made non-domestic beatings and serious fights a realistic risk, especially with
#     periodic displacement and laboring.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 29–31 (c. 1930–1932); single event
#   type: physical_assault
# - event: While cutting and dragging a heavy sal-wood log as side work during the slack
#     season, the log rolled and trapped his lower leg; neighbors freed him, but the
#     injury swelled badly and he was laid up for weeks, walking with a limp for months
#     afterward.
#   reasoning: Agricultural and forest-edge livelihoods involved tools, trees, carts,
#     and water crossings; a serious injury causing weeks of incapacity was fairly plausible
#     over 40 years.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 24–26 (c. 1925–1927); single event
#   type: serious_accident
# - event: In late adolescence he had a consensual sexual relationship with a girl from
#     a nearby hamlet he met at seasonal dances and festivals; it lasted several months
#     and ended when her family arranged a match elsewhere and his own marriage talks
#     began.
#   reasoning: Premarital sexual activity was a common route for 'nonstandard' history
#     in many rural settings, including encounters during youth festivals, work migration,
#     or courtship prior to marriage.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 17–19 (c. 1918–1920); sustained period
#   type: premarital_sex
# - event: During a stretch of work away from home on contract earthworks/road repair,
#     he had a discreet affair with a married woman in the work-line/settlement area;
#     it involved a handful of meetings over a few months and ended when he returned
#     home permanently to focus on cultivation.
#   reasoning: Extramarital sex occurred but was constrained by community surveillance;
#     low extraversion reduces opportunity-seeking, while low honesty-humility modestly
#     increases rule-breaking risk.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 33–35 (c. 1934–1936); sustained period
#   type: extramarital_sex

Joga was born on June 27, 1901, in a Santal hamlet near Nayagram in the forest-edge country of the Jungle Mahals, under British rule in Bengal. The village lay between rice fields and sal forest. Rent and debts ran through the year, collected through intermediaries. In his household, Santal rites for bongas sat beside visits to nearby Hindu shrines and festival days tied to the Bengali calendar.

He arrived as the sixth child. Two tiny brothers had died before him, and an older sister, Jhano, was spoken of only in brief, as an infant carried out before she could sit. The eldest brother, Sona, already moved like a small adult by the time Joga learned to walk. Biru, the next brother, kept a quick tongue and a taste for news. Their father, Rupa, left for stretches at a time to haul earth on roadwork and carry loads for estate contractors, returning with small coin and sore shoulders. Their mother, Phulo, kept the cooking fire going and still went out for wage work, weeding and transplanting in other people’s fields. Joga’s paternal grandparents ran the compound. Budhna made sure the boys rose early and did not waste grain. Dukhi knew the names and habits of the spirits that mattered nearby and kept a small corner of the house clean for offerings.

Joga's earliest memories were of being handed tasks: carrying water in a small pot, keeping goats from a neighbor's seedlings, chasing crows from drying rice. In 1903 a sister, Lita, was born and died before the monsoon ended. The next year a brother, Jatra, arrived and survived. Joga grew into a quiet child who listened from the edge. At dusk he sat by the doorway, eating rice with watery dal and a pinch of salt, watching the older men talk. When he was given a job, he did it in the same order each time. He did not forget where he had put a sickle, or how much grain had been measured out for seed.

In 1912 Budhna died after a short illness. The funeral brought relatives, drumming, and the smell of rice beer. After that, Rupa ran the household. He demanded quick obedience and had a hand that landed fast. Joga learned when to lower his eyes and when to argue by asking questions instead of making statements. Biru teased him for it, calling him “old man,” and Joga answered by taking the best share of roasted yams without a word. That made Biru laugh, and the two sometimes sat together behind the cattle shed, eating in silence.

Forest rules tightened as Joga grew. Guards watched for timber cutting and for collection that crossed the line from what was tolerated to what could be fined. Men still went in for fallen wood and leaf plates, but they did it with more caution and with lookout boys. Joga learned paths that avoided the main tracks. He learned which officials could be greeted with folded hands and which demanded a small bribe of tobacco.

The influenza years hit when he was seventeen. People in nearby villages died quickly, and the sound of coughing carried at night. Dukhi burned neem leaves, smeared turmeric on doorposts, and placed a small dish with rice and a few flowers for the bongas. Joga helped fetch water and kept the courtyard swept. He watched who recovered and who did not, and he remembered how long fevers lasted.

In 1919, at a seasonal dance after the harvest, he began seeing a girl from a nearby hamlet. They met at the edge of the clearing after the drumming started, then later behind a line of shrubs near the fields. He did not boast about it. He kept it between them, and it lasted into the next year. She pressed him to speak of marriage; he answered with practical questions about her household and cattle. In 1920 her family arranged her match elsewhere. By then, talk had started in his own house about finding him a wife, and he let the older men make the visits.

Dukhi died that same year, after a short illness that left her unable to rise from her mat. Joga helped carry her to the burial ground. The compound felt emptier without her.

He married Hira in 1921. The wedding was marked with rice beer, drumming, and exchanges between the two families. Hira was not shy, but she watched his face before speaking in public. In their first year, they lived near his brothers' households, then pushed toward a more separate arrangement, building their own routine around a tiny sharecropped plot and bits of wage work. Joga liked the early morning before others came to the fields. He walked the bunds, checked for breaks and crab holes, and counted in his head what seed and labor they could afford.

Their first child, Chandni, was born in 1923 and died the same year after a sudden sickness. Joga spent money on a healer and on offerings. At the small earthen spot set aside for household spirits, they placed cooked rice and a little chicken blood. On Hindu festival days, Hira carried flowers and a small lamp to a nearby shrine, and Joga went with her, standing back, letting her place the offerings.

In 1925 he took side work in the sal forest during the slack season, cutting and dragging wood. One day a heavy log rolled and trapped his lower leg. Haradhan, a neighbor who worked nearby, helped pry it free. The leg swelled, and Joga lay on a mat for weeks, teeth clenched when he had to be moved. Hira fed him rice gruel and kept the household going with help from Biru and Jatra, who hauled water and guarded the field. When Joga rose again he walked with a limp that lasted through the next monsoon, and he became sharper about risks. He stopped trusting young men who laughed while they worked.

Sukri was born in 1927. Joga did not celebrate loudly. He watched for fever and kept the child close to the hearth at night. Phulo came often in the early months, helping Hira with the infant and bringing small gifts of food when she could spare them. As Sukri grew, Joga kept her clean and well-fed when possible. She was quick to learn, and he liked that.

The depression years brought hunger to the village. Grain prices fell; advances came with harsher terms. Joga began negotiating more aggressively. He counted measures twice, then once again when he thought an agent was watching. He kept a hidden pot of rice in a corner of the house, covered under cloth and old baskets, and he told Hira not to mention it.

In 1931, at the weekly haat, a dispute over a sharecropping payment and an advance he owed turned ugly. Two men connected to Mahajan Bholanath pushed him between stalls and hit him with fists and a lathi. Joga went down once and got up again, turning his shoulder to protect his ribs. He came home bruised and sore, unable to work for several days. Hira wanted to take it to the police; he refused and instead set out to shift his debts and his share arrangement away from Bholanath’s circle.

That same year Rupa died. The older brothers took the front in public rituals and dealings, but Joga became the one who kept accounts in his head and decided which obligations could be delayed. He spoke little at meetings, then met Kesto, the overseer who handled tenancy terms, alone by a field edge and pressed for a more favorable split. He offered labor at peak times and a small gift of rice beer at the right moment. Over the next years his plot became more secure. People began treating him as a man who could be relied on to bring seed on time and to show up when labor was promised.

In 1934 he went away for road repair work for several months to cover debts and buy a little seed and a tool. In the work settlement he began a discreet affair with Rukmini, a married woman whose husband was often away. They met a handful of times, keeping it quiet. When he returned home in 1936 he brought salt and a small brass bangle for Sukri, and acted as if nothing had happened. Hira understood more than he admitted. They argued once, in low voices at night, then turned back to the fields.

Phulo's health worsened in the late 1930s. She coughed, tired easily, and stopped joining wage work. Joga and Hira fed her first when grain ran low. He carried her to a healer and then to a small Hindu shrine, placing flowers and a coin. He also called the naeke, Karam, for village rites, and the household offered rice beer and a chicken at the spirit place. Jatra came most days to sit with her and help move her when she needed to relieve herself. Phulo died in 1938, and Joga took on the duties of arranging the funeral and hosting relatives with what he could afford.

By 1941 he lived with Hira and fourteen-year-old Sukri. He had a steadier hold on land than he had grown up with, and he guarded that respectability. He avoided public talk of politics, though he watched prices and rumors closely as wartime pressures tightened markets.

After the monsoon, mosquitoes thickened in the evenings. Late in October he was struck by a severe fever. Hira and Sukri kept him on a mat in the house, wiping him and feeding him water when he could swallow. On October 30, 1941, Joga died. His body was washed and laid out, and the household placed a small offering of cooked rice and a few flowers, then carried him to be buried on village ground, with drumming and the last rites led by the elders.
