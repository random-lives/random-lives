#       Likely emotionally reserved but invested; focused on keeping the household fed.

#     name: Fatuma
#     narrative_role: Not present in Yusuf’s remembered life. Setting her death shortly

#       Yusuf was a toddler she was old enough to carry him, watch him while adults

#     narrative_role: Older brother close to adulthood-in-training when Yusuf was small;
#       likely out herding or helping in fields/market errands. His relationship with

Yusuf was born on September 16, 1880, in the upland fields near Gelemso in Hararghe, as Menelik's power pushed east and shifting chiefs and tax collectors pressed the local Oromo-speaking villages. His household spoke Oromo outside the gate, and another language inside, carried from an older migration. The family prayed in Muslim ways—washed hands, murmured Qur'anic verses, kept a leather amulet tied to a child's neck—and they also went to a sacred tree for vows when sickness stayed.

His father, Abdullahi, farmed rented strips of land and bartered grain when the stores ran low. Hawa, Yusuf’s stepmother, managed goats and chickens, skimmed milk, and turned it into butter for market days. The compound had children everywhere. Amina, born in 1872, kept watch when adults worked. Ali, born in 1874, walked out with animals or a hoe and came back dusty. Hassan, born in 1877, stayed close to Yusuf, pulling him by the hand toward the threshing place.

A baby brother, also called Abdullahi, arrived in 1882. Yusuf still sat on Hawa’s hip when she fed the goats, then reached for the newborn’s cloth wrap.

After the rains in 1883 measles moved through the neighborhood. Yusuf broke out in spots, then coughed hard and stopped taking food. Abdullahi brought Sheikh Nur to recite over water and write verses for a new amulet; Hawa rubbed butter into Yusuf’s dry lips and took a little grain and coffee husks to the sacred tree as a vowed offering. Yusuf died on November 1, 1883. Before dusk the men washed him and wrapped him in cloth, and they buried him in the ground near the settlement with a brief Muslim prayer.
