#     narrative_role: 'Primary caregiver and household subsistence manager (food processing,

#     narrative_role: Much older sister—already doing near-adult work (hauling water,
#       minding small children, helping at the hearth and with craft-prep) in the mother-centered
#       household. She likely acted as a secondary caretaker and emotional anchor for

#     narrative_role: Older brother who died in toddlerhood a couple of years before
#       Kira’s birth. Remembered indirectly through the mother’s grief and protective

#       infant illness and bad luck.

Kira was born in a small farming and craft hamlet on the dry forest edge of northern Gujarat. Her family spoke a local Harappan tongue and lived without her father, Kavi, a craft worker who stayed away for long stretches and sent goods through relatives. Pots and ornaments from larger market towns passed through the village by barter.

Her mother, Sani, ran the household around the hearth: grinding grain, keeping the water pots filled, and directing the older children. The oldest, Tali, was twenty-four and worked as another adult in the yard, lifting bundles of fuelwood and taking charge when Sani’s contractions started. Sani’s only son, Juna, had died at two; his absence shaped the birth rites. Hali, Sani's mother, arrived before dawn with a cord of fiber, clean cloth, and a small pouch of beads and stones used as amulets. Vena, the village midwife, washed her hands, warmed water, and set a shallow dish near the hearth for offerings.

Kira came hard and slow. When she emerged she did not cry, and Vena worked at her mouth and chest while Hali murmured words meant to turn away harm. Sani pressed an amulet against the baby's skin and rubbed oil along her ribs. Kira breathed, finally, but weakly. She nursed a little that first night and slept against Sani's chest. Over five days she took less and less milk. On the fifth morning she stopped breathing in Sani's arms.

They wrapped her in cloth, laid her in a small pit at the edge of the dwelling area, and placed a pinch of grain and a bead beside her before covering the earth.
