Kamiri was born as the dry season began, when the grass on the open ground turned pale and the nights cooled. His family’s shelters stood above a narrow stream. Buriti palms marked the wet spots. On the sand near the water, people read fresh tracks before deciding where to hunt.

His father left before first light with a bow and a short spear. He returned with meat bundled in leaves and shared it out without fuss. People watched what he brought back, and when the older men spoke about where to move next, they waited for his answer. He did not shout. He spoke once and others followed.

Kamiri’s mother kept ties between close kin. She walked to nearby camps with small bundles—dried fruit, fibers, and sharp flakes—and came back with cord, resin, and help for her household. When visitors arrived, the night filled with stamping and rattles. Songs named animals and places. Kamiri was carried through the circle so hands could touch his hair and cheeks, and so the women could judge if he was growing.

He was the second child his mother bore. The first, a boy, had died soon after birth. A girl lived longer and then failed at the end of her first year. Kamiri’s parents did not talk much about them, but they watched him closely. His mother counted his swallows. His father checked his belly and the smell of his stool, then brought extra water to the shelter.

Near the end of the rains the stream shrank, and families camped closer to the remaining pools. Children began to sicken. Kamiri’s diarrhea started first, then fever. His mother kept him at her breast and gave him water from her palm. His mouth went slack and he stopped crying. He died before the next dry season returned, in the afternoon heat, while the adults argued about whether to leave the water or stay.
