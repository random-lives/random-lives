#   - death_year: 934
#     name: Keśava
#     narrative_role: 'Smallholder cultivator and cattle-keeper; firm on work discipline
#       but generally fair. Relationship with Dāmodara is mixed: pride in his cleverness
#       and social ease, frustration at his lax follow-through; becomes dependent in
#       old age, prompting Dāmodara’s caregiving.'
#     role: father
#   - death_year: 936
#     name: Rukmiṇī
#     narrative_role: Household manager and field worker; carries repeated infant losses
#       and becomes physically worn (joint pain) later. Close bond with Dāmodara as
#       the surviving son who stays unmarried and present; she relies on him for errands
#       and ritual observances in her later years.
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: 887
#     name: Nārāyaṇa
#     narrative_role: Senior male when Dāmodara is a boy; teaches him field boundaries,
#       cattle lore, and village etiquette. Relationship is warm but authority-heavy;
#       his death shifts authority to Keśava earlier than expected.
#     role: paternal grandfather
#   - death_year: 894
#     name: Padmā
#     narrative_role: Domestic authority among women; organizes food stores and ritual
#       days. Relationship is affectionate but she scolds Dāmodara for talking too much
#       and neglecting chores.
#     role: paternal grandmother
#   children: []
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 33
#     connection: Occurs after harvest during an escalating boundary dispute as land
#       pressure builds in the joint family; settlement mediated by elders reinforces
#       his reputation as forceful but not lawless.
#     incident: physical_assault_perp
#   - age: 45
#     connection: Recurring monsoon-season fevers begin in midlife, reducing his field
#       capacity; prompts greater reliance on nephews/brothers for ploughing and positions
#       him more as negotiator/organizer than constant laborer.
#     incident: chronic_illness
#   - age: 56
#     connection: As his father becomes frail and mother’s joints worsen, his caregiving
#       intensifies; his intermittent illness complicates this, creating periods where
#       he must arrange help rather than provide it physically.
#     incident: elderly_parents
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-7
#     key_events:
#     - Grows up amid repeated infant/child deaths; learns household rites (lamp, offerings)
#       and the routines of mourning (871-878).
#     - Learns basic farm tasks early (herding calves, carrying water), pushed by labor
#       needs in a large joint household (c. 876-878).
#     - Death of brother Bhairava (883) becomes his first strong memory of grief; elders
#       emphasize discipline and protection rituals.
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 8-17
#     key_events:
#     - Grandfather dies (887) and authority consolidates under his father; Dāmodara
#       is drawn into adult conversations because few younger siblings survive (c. 887-890).
#     - Learns boundary knowledge, cattle management, and market dealings; his talkativeness
#       makes him useful as an errand-runner to nearby haats (c. 890-895).
#     - Experiences at least one bad monsoon year with food tightening and higher prices;
#       household responds by mixing forest foods and tightening grain stores (plausibly
#       c. 894-896).
#     phase: Later childhood and adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-49
#     key_events:
#     - Remains unmarried despite social expectation; becomes the kin member often sent
#       to negotiate, witness transactions, and speak with outsiders due to confidence
#       and quick thinking (c. 889-920s continuing).
#     - Household fission pressures and land boundary tensions rise as cousins/uncles
#       manage plots; he gains a reputation for being forceful in disputes (c. 900-910).
#     - A localized drought or multi-season dry spell stresses fodder and yields; the
#       family protects cattle and relies on loans/advance grain (plausibly c. 907-909).
#     phase: Adult life (prime working years)
#   - age_range: 50-74
#     key_events:
#     - Takes a leading role caring for aging parents within the joint household and
#       managing errands/ritual obligations (921-933).
#     - Parents die in close succession (934 and 936); his standing rises as a senior
#       male adviser, though not a household head (mid-930s).
#     - Dies in 946 after age-related decline with a respiratory infection/fever; household
#       performs standard Brahmanical death rites under kin leadership (946).
#     phase: Old age and seniority
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Jaya
#     prominence: Prominent around ages 30-35 (c. 901-906), then becomes a lingering

#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds wide local familiarity and informal influence; also increases
#       exposure to conflict and makes him more likely to escalate arguments when challenged.
#     scene: At the periodic market (haat), he jokes with traders, gathers news of prices
#       and rumors, and confidently speaks for his household in small disputes over
#       measures.
#     timing: Adolescence through late adulthood (c. ages 14-60)
#     trait: Extraversion (92nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Creates friction with father and older kin; contributes to disputes
#       when boundaries or upkeep are neglected, setting the stage for the later assault
#       incident.
#     scene: He procrastinates on repairing bunds or fences until elders press him;
#       he prefers talking/negotiating to repetitive maintenance work and sometimes
#       leaves tasks half-finished.
#     timing: Young adulthood (c. ages 18-35)
#     trait: Low Conscientiousness (23rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Improves outcomes for his kin in negotiations but raises the likelihood
#       of heated confrontations and at least one serious fight.
#     scene: In village council settings, he is blunt, interrupts, and insists on his
#       household’s interpretation of field lines and compensation, refusing to back
#       down quickly.
#     timing: Adulthood (c. ages 25-45)
#     trait: Low Agreeableness (29th percentile)
#   - consequence: Enhances reputation as a fair (if harsh) negotiator; helps explain
#       why he gains slightly higher standing without being viewed as a cheat.
#     scene: He resists taking extra from communal grain measures and speaks against
#       quietly shifting boundary stones at night, even when younger men suggest it.
#     timing: Adulthood into old age (c. ages 30-70)
#     trait: High Honesty-Humility (84th percentile)
#   - consequence: Moves him into a spokesperson/organizer niche despite illiteracy;
#       supports modest upward mobility within the village.
#     scene: He quickly learns price differences between nearby markets and remembers
#       oral boundary histories and kin obligations, using them persuasively in disputes.
#     timing: Adolescence onward (c. ages 15-60)
#     trait: High Intelligence (72nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Improves resilience and social stability; helps him keep functioning
#       and retain respect despite chronic illness and unmarried status.
#     scene: During bad monsoon years and during his recurring fevers, he remains relatively
#       calm and pragmatic, focusing on arranging help rather than catastrophizing.
#     timing: Midlife and old age (c. ages 40-74)
#     trait: Low Neuroticism (26th percentile)
# number_of_children: '0'
# number_of_siblings: 10+
# occupation: Cultivator (smallholder/tenant farmer; mixed farming with cattle)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During a boundary dispute after harvest over a strip of field near the village
#     edge, he struck a neighboring cultivator with a wooden staff and fists when the
#     argument escalated, leaving the man bloodied and unable to work for several days;
#     the quarrel was later settled by elders with compensation in grain.
#   reasoning: For a rural cultivator with very high extraversion and low agreeableness,
#     participation in at least one serious fight/assault over boundaries, insults,
#     or communal disputes is the most common violence subtype.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 32-34
#   type: physical_assault_perp
# - event: He suffered recurring bouts of fever with chills and profound weakness that
#     returned seasonally (especially after the rains), forcing him to stay near the
#     hearth for days at a time and rely on kin to manage ploughing and cattle; between
#     bouts he was functional but noticeably thinner and easily fatigued.
#   reasoning: Long-lived adults commonly experienced recurring fevers (malaria-like),
#     chronic respiratory disease, gastrointestinal issues, or pain syndromes that limited
#     work intermittently over years.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 41-58 (intermittent recurrent episodes)
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: When his father became frail and his mother’s joints stiffened with age,
#     he took a leading role in their day-to-day support within the joint household—arranging
#     food portions, escorting them to ritual occasions, and handling trips to the market
#     and local healer so his married brothers could keep the fields running.
#   reasoning: 'As child #2 in a large sibship, he could have had living parents into
#     his adulthood; being unmarried increases availability for elder support, but caregiving
#     might also fall to a married brother’s household.'

Dāmodara was born at the end of the winter of 871 in a hamlet on the dry-deciduous plateau north of the Damodar. The village lay on the fringe of the eastern kingdoms that took their revenues from the plains; officials rarely came themselves, but obligations arrived through local headmen, messengers, and the men who kept lists in their heads. His household spoke an eastern Indo-Aryan village speech with plateau words mixed in, and they kept Brahmanical practice at home: lamp at dusk, water for ancestors, and offerings at the small shrine by the field path.

He entered a crowded compound. His father Keśava ploughed small plots with cattle and shared work with his brothers under his own father Nārāyaṇa’s authority. His mother Rukmiṇī ran the hearth and worked the fields when the weeding needed hands. Dāmodara’s older sister Sītā, born in 869, carried him on her hip while Rukmiṇī pounded grain on the stone and Padmā, the grandmother, kept an eye on the cooking pots. Dāmodara learned the smells of the place early: cow dung plaster drying on the courtyard wall, warm rice water poured off into a small bowl, mustard oil for lamps, smoke from sal leaves thrown on the fire.

The births that followed came close together, and the household turned repeatedly to funerary rites. A baby boy, Kanu, born in 872, died before he could take to solid food. Mādhava, born in 873, lived long enough to run unsteadily in the dust; he died in 876 during the season when stomach sickness spread through the children. Gaurī arrived in 875 and died the same year. Nanda lasted from 876 into 877. The women washed the tiny bodies, wrapped them in cloth, and carried them beyond the houses for disposal; afterward Rukmiṇī smeared fresh cow dung on the threshold and placed a small heap of rice near the household deity stone.

Dāmodara grew into a loud child who pulled at adult attention. He talked while he worked, peppering his father’s brothers with questions about where one field ended and another began. Keśava liked the boy’s quickness and disliked his wandering focus. When Dāmodara was sent to herd calves at the edge of the sal and palāś trees, he returned with news of who had crossed which path and what they carried, but sometimes with a rope knotted wrong or a water pot cracked from being set down carelessly.

Bhairava, born in 878, became his closest companion, because the younger ones rarely stayed. Dāmodara and Bhairava chased each other between stacks of drying stalks, stole roasted gram from the pan when Padmā turned her back, and listened at dusk to older men talking about prices at the haat. Hari, born in 880, died the next year. Lakṣmī was born and died in 882. Gopāl in 884. When Bhairava died in 883, Dāmodara stopped speaking for days, then began again, louder than before, interrupting elders and correcting small details. Śiva, the last child, was born in 886 and died at four. After that Rukmiṇī bore no more.

Nārāyaṇa, the grandfather, died in 887, and the center of the household shifted. Keśava took charge, more strict about work and more alert to disputes. Dāmodara, now a boy old enough to carry loads, walked behind his father to the fields and watched where Keśava set the plough. He memorized ridges and trees used as markers. He also learned what happened when markers moved. Padmā lived on until 894; she was still sharp enough to slap his hand away when he snatched mango pickle too early. Her death brought another round of rites, and afterward the women took longer at the lamp each evening, whispering names of the dead into the smoke.

In his teens, Dāmodara began accompanying older men to the market. He liked the noise and the bargaining. He stood close to grain sellers to watch how they leveled the measuring pots and how disputes were settled with a few loud words and a laugh. He carried salt back in small bundles, sometimes a metal hook, sometimes a length of cloth. He learned to recognize a fair measure, and he liked catching someone shaving a handful off the top. Keśava used him for errands because he returned with information and could talk people down when there was trouble. Keśava also shouted at him for leaving the bund repairs late and for forgetting to tether a calf properly.

A poor monsoon year in the mid-890s tightened food. Grain went out faster than it came in, and Rukmiṇī mixed more forest greens into the pot. Dāmodara hated the days when the rice thinned and the millet tasted bitter from being stored too long. He took satisfaction in small things he could still control: sitting on the hard edge of the threshing floor at dusk, eating a piece of jaggery if someone had brought it from market, and telling Sītā a story he’d heard from traders, changing the ending until she laughed and told him to stop.

Marriage talks rose and fell. Keśava’s brothers arranged matches for their own sons, but Dāmodara did not settle. He enjoyed being out among people, and he resisted being tied to a new household unit. Priests and elders scolded him gently, then sharply, about a man’s duties. He attended the festivals anyway: on Śivarātri he brought bilva leaves, on Janmāṣṭamī he joined the singing, and during harvest he helped offer a first handful of grain to Viṣṇu before anyone ate from the new stores. He spoke comfortably with the village priest Kāśīnātha, but he never learned letters. When land matters required marks, he relied on witnesses and memory.

At thirty-three, after a harvest in 904, the household’s boundaries became a fight. A neighboring cultivator named Jaya claimed a thin strip of soil near the village edge where the ridges were low and easy to blur. Dāmodara went with other men to argue the line. He talked over people, accused Jaya of creeping his plough too far, and pushed past a cousin who tried to hold him back. The dispute turned into shoving. Dāmodara grabbed a wooden staff and struck Jaya, then hit him with his fists when Jaya fell. Jaya’s face bled, and he stayed off work for days. Bhadra, an elder who mediated disputes, called both households together. Grain compensation was agreed, and Dāmodara paid with clenched jaw and tight words, refusing to apologize but accepting the settlement to keep the fields from splitting into open feud.

The years after brought more strain on land and fodder. A dry spell in 907 and 908 reduced yields; cattle went lean. Dāmodara argued at market about fodder and grazing rights, pushing hard, but he did not cheat on measures. His bluntness annoyed some men, yet he ended up being asked to speak because he remembered details, names, and who had promised what.

At forty-five, in 916, the fevers began. After the rains, he would shiver and sweat, then lie near the hearth wrapped in cloth while others carried water and did the heavy work. When he could stand, he walked to a healer for bitter decoctions and chewed neem leaves despite hating the taste. Between episodes he returned to the fields, thinner than before, but he kept his mouth busy. He reorganized tasks, told nephews where to drive cattle, and went to market on good weeks, leaning on a stick more from habit than need.

When Keśava’s strength failed in 921, Dāmodara stepped into a role he had avoided for years: not husband or father, but caretaker. He arranged food portions so the old man ate first when the pot was small. He escorted Keśava to ritual occasions, steadying him with an arm, and he brought offerings to the household shrine on his father’s behalf—flowers, a small smear of ghee, a pinch of rice, water poured slowly with the right hand. Rukmiṇī’s joints stiffened, and she could no longer squat long at the grinding stone; Dāmodara organized younger women and boys to take turns, and he carried her to sit in the sun in the morning. On market days he returned with salt and oil and small comforts: a bit of tamarind, sometimes dried fish from traders coming up from the plains, which he ate himself and shared with Sītā, joking about how it smelled worse than the cattle shed.

Keśava died in 934, and Rukmiṇī followed in 936. Kāśīnātha performed the household rites, and Dāmodara managed the practical side, calling relatives, arranging fuel, and keeping quarrels down while grief made people short-tempered. Afterward he sat more often with Somu, a nephew rising into household headship, and spoke with confidence about boundaries, obligations, and who could be trusted in a bargain. Somu listened because Dāmodara kept the household's interests clear, even when his tongue cut too sharply.

Sītā died in 940. She was seventy-one, gray-haired and slow, and she had stayed near Dāmodara longer than anyone else in the family. After her death, Dāmodara spoke less and sat more often on the low wall at the edge of the yard, watching the cattle and the people passing.

Dāmodara reached seventy-four still living within the joint compound, senior among men though not a householder in his own right. In August of 946, after days of coughing and fever, he died on the sleeping platform in the main room. His nephews carried the body to the cremation place and burned it with dry wood; afterward they gathered the bone fragments and offered water and rice balls for the ancestor rites.
