# ethnicity: Telugu-speaking Andhra (South Indian, Deccan plateau)
# father_occupation: Cultivator + livestock herding (cattle/goats) as a substantial
#   secondary livelihood
# historical_context:
# - event: Post-Kakatiya political fragmentation and local power struggles in the Andhra/Telangana–Rayalaseema
#     sphere, leading to changing overlords and revenue collectors for villages.
#   timing: Childhood through early adulthood (c. 1330s–1350s; ages 5–25)
# - event: Formation and consolidation of the Bahmani Sultanate (from 1347) and subsequent
#     Deccan warfare/raiding cycles that periodically affected interior districts via
#     troop movements, requisitioning, and tax pressure.
#   timing: Midlife (c. 1350s–1380s; ages 25–55)
# - event: Recurring drought-lean years in the semi-arid Deccan thorn scrub zone causing
#     crop failures, high grain prices, and stress on herds (forcing longer grazing
#     circuits and distress sales).
#   timing: Repeated across adult life, especially ages 20–65
# - event: Growing monetization and market-linkage in parts of the Deccan (use of coin
#     for taxes, market towns for grain/animals), increasing exposure to price swings
#     and the need to sell livestock to meet dues.
#   timing: Gradual; strongest impact in adulthood (ages 25–65)
# - event: Periodic waves of epidemic illness and heightened mortality (local outbreaks
#     of fevers, pox-like diseases), not necessarily a single famous plague event but
#     recurring community-wide shocks.
#   timing: Intermittent throughout life (ages 0–72)
# household_social_status: Ordinary peasant cultivator (smallholder or customary rights
#   in village land; tax-paying)
# household_structure_at_birth: Married biological parents in a nuclear household (parents
#   + children), separate from grandparents/uncles

# mental_disorder: Alcohol-related disorder (harmful use or dependence developing in
#   adulthood)
# migration: Stayed in/near birth village for life (same settlement or within a few
#   kilometers)
# mother_occupation: Mixed domestic labor + substantial livestock/dairy work (milking,
#   processing, fodder) alongside childcare
# narrative_plan:
#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: 1366
#     name: Somayya
#     narrative_role: Competent, status-conscious smallholder who expects obedience
#       and hard work; he trains Gopayya in herd handling and bargaining but clashes
#       with him over temper and respect toward others. Death (likely fever) pushes
#       Gopayya toward more mobile herding and weaker household discipline.
#     role: father (cultivator + livestock/dairy; later more herding)
#   - death_year: 1378
#     name: Lakshmamma
#     narrative_role: Practical and religiously attentive (vows to the grama-devata,
#       household offerings); she buffers conflicts between father and son and later
#       becomes a moral pressure point regarding Gopayya’s drinking and marriage. Her
#       death removes a stabilizing force.
#     role: mother (domestic + substantial livestock/dairy work)

#   - birth_year: 1348
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 1348
#     name: Rangayya
#     narrative_role: First son, dies at or soon after birth; loss increases tension
#       in the marriage and intensifies ritual responses (vows, offerings) rather than
#       long-term household expansion.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1351
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 1351
#     name: Kesavayya
#     narrative_role: Second son, also dies neonatally; after this, the marriage shifts
#       from hopeful to brittle, and kin begin to discuss blame, impurity, and fate.
#     sex: M
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 38
#     connection: Begins during a drought-lean period when grazing is scarce; his herds
#       stray/are deliberately pushed onto others’ scrub and crop edges, and he learns
#       he can evade compensation by intimidation and by invoking patron connections.
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   - age: 46
#     connection: Continues after his father’s death when he is more autonomous; underreports
#       milk/ghee dues while increasingly dependent on a larger household’s protection
#       and credit.
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   - age: 52
#     connection: Tapers as his reputation hardens and he becomes more clearly attached
#       to a patron household, shifting from independent denial to quiet shorting of
#       dues.
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   - age: 41
#     connection: Starts after repeated infant loss and growing marital bitterness;
#       his travel with herds and presence at fairs/temple days creates opportunity.
#     incident: extramarital_sex
#   - age: 47
#     connection: Ends as gossip, conflict, and increased drinking make the liaison
#       too risky; helps crystallize the long-term separation from his wife.
#     incident: extramarital_sex
#   - age: 49
#     connection: Occurs on market-town trips made necessary by monetized dues and grain
#       purchases; also tied to loneliness after separation and heavier drinking patterns.
#     incident: sex_work
#   - age: 55
#     connection: Last cluster as aging and dependence on a patron household reduces
#       independent travel and disposable goods.

#     - '1364–1378: recurring tax pressure/market dependence; he increasingly relies
#       on patrons and market towns for grain and sale of animals.'
#     - '1371: effective separation becomes the stable arrangement; he spends more nights
#       away and begins attaching himself to larger herding/landholder networks.'

#   - age_range: 61-72
#     key_events:
#     - '1380s–1390s: lives as an attached dependent/retainer in a patron’s larger herding/landholder

#       and dues; alternately pressured and flattered by Gopayya.
#   - name: Basavayya
#     prominence: Ages 45-72 (especially after marital separation)
#     relationship: Wealthier herd owner/landholder who becomes Gopayya’s patron; provides
#       protection and occasional grain/credit in exchange for service and a cut of
#       proceeds.
#   - name: Chinna

#       create opportunity and whose return heightens risk and gossip.
#   partners:
#   - name: Chennadevi
#     narrative_role: Wife from a nearby village; marriage begins as a work partnership
#       (household + animals) but deteriorates as Gopayya’s quarrelsome dominance and
#       increasing drink lead to mistrust, then separation. She eventually resides mostly
#       with her natal kin, with only intermittent contact afterward.

#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: 1330
#     death_age: 4
#     death_year: 1334
#     name: Timmamma
#     narrative_role: Second early child death in the sibling set; reinforces the family’s
#       reliance on protective village-goddess rites and practical healing.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds wide weak-tie networks (useful for patronage and evading penalties)
#       but also amplifies conflicts and reputation for being ‘too much’.
#     scene: At cattle markets and temple-fair gatherings he dominates talk, jokes loudly,
#       inserts himself into disputes, and volunteers for errands that put him in the
#       center of news and bargaining.
#     timing: Visible from adolescence; strongest ages 15-55
#     trait: Extraversion (very high)
#   - consequence: Village friction, marital breakdown, and reliance on patrons who
#       value toughness but keep him at arm’s length.
#     scene: When accused of grazing damage he mocks the complainant, reframes blame,
#       and threatens retaliation; at home he treats disagreement as insubordination.
#     timing: Adolescence onward; peaks during midlife drinking years (30-55)
#     trait: Agreeableness (very low)
#   - consequence: Short-term gains and survival in lean years; long-term erosion of
#       trust and increased dependence on protective relationships rather than community
#       goodwill.
#     scene: He boasts about ‘outsmarting’ dues collectors, takes small advantages in
#       transactions, and expects others to yield because he is louder and better connected.
#     timing: Adulthood (25-55)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (low)
#   - consequence: Helps him remain employable/usable as a retainer-herder even after
#       family life collapses.
#     scene: Despite drinking, he keeps careful track of herd headcounts, grazing routes,
#       and market days; when tasked by a patron, he can be punctual and methodical
#       for stretches.
#     timing: Adulthood into old age (20-70), with interruptions
#     trait: Conscientiousness (high)
#   - consequence: Increases his time away from home and exposure to temptations (drink,
#       affairs) and to monetized market life.
#     scene: He is unusually interested in songs, stories, and new practices at fairs;
#       he picks up bits of script recognition and enjoys novelty in markets and pilgrim
#       crowds.
#     timing: Late childhood through midlife (10-50)
#     trait: Openness (high)
#   - consequence: Escalates violence and sexual risk-taking, accelerates marital estrangement,
#       and makes him acceptable mainly in roles where patrons can supervise or tolerate
#       his volatility.
#     scene: 'What starts as festival drinking becomes frequent use after his father’s
#       death: morning drinking on travel days, irritability when drink is unavailable,
#       and binge episodes after market sales.'
#     timing: Onset ages 35-45; worst ages 45-60; persists into old age with intermittent
#       control
#     trait: Alcohol-related disorder (harmful use/dependence)
# number_of_children: '2'
# number_of_siblings: '5'
# occupation: Primarily pastoral/herding (moves locally with herds; farming secondary)
# religion: Village Hindu practice centered on grama-devata (village goddess/guardian)
#   + household puja and seasonal festivals

# structured_incidents:
# - event: While grazing goats and a few cattle on the edge of another hamlet’s lands
#     during a dry season, he repeatedly let the animals feed on standing crops and
#     scrub reserved for others and later denied it, avoiding compensation through bluster
#     and patron ties; he also underreported a small portion of milk/ghee dues owed
#     to the household he depended on.
#   reasoning: Pastoral work plus low honesty-humility increases likelihood of at least
#     one incident like livestock pilfering, boundary grazing/poaching, under-reporting
#     dues, or opportunistic theft, which were widespread in marginal economies.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Recurring pattern, roughly ages 38–52 (especially in drought-lean years)
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime
# - event: After his marriage became strained and he spent nights away with grazing
#     and errands, he maintained an on-and-off affair with a married woman from a nearby
#     settlement he met at a local festival/market, arranging meetings during temple
#     days and when her husband was away.
#   reasoning: Marital estrangement, high extraversion, and low honesty-humility make
#     affairs or opportunistic liaisons the most likely non-normative pattern for a
#     married man.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Sustained period, roughly ages 41–47
#   type: extramarital_sex
# - event: On trips to a larger market town to sell animals and buy salt/grain, he occasionally
#     exchanged small payments and gifts (coin, cloth, liquor, or grain) for sex with
#     a woman who took such customers discreetly near the bazaar quarter, treating it
#     as a transaction rather than a relationship.
#   reasoning: Transactional sex existed (often informal rather than a formalized occupation),
#     but for a rural herder it would be occasional and context-dependent, less common
#     than adultery.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Single/occasional events clustered in adulthood, roughly ages 48–55
#   type: sex_work

Gopayya was born in December 1326 in a dry, thorn-scrub countryside east of the Deccan plateau, in a Telugu-speaking village world of wells, cattle pens, and scattered fields. Authority shifted above the village—first the remains of Kakatiya power, then new men and new seals—but in his hamlet the practical rulers were the headman, the account-keeper, the landholders who could advance grain, and the shrine of the village goddess who took offerings for protection.

His father Somayya held customary rights to a small piece of land and kept goats and a few cattle. His mother Lakshmamma rose before light, blew on the hearth, and set water to boil, then went to the pen with a pot and rope to milk. She tied turmeric-stained threads on the arms of children when sickness came, and she carried neem leaves and a coconut to the grama-devata’s stone at the edge of the settlement. Gopayya was the fourth of six children, and the only son. Mallamma, his eldest sister, learned early to speak for the household in other people’s yards. Nagayya, the second girl, died in 1328 after days of loose stools and thirst. Chennamma, born a year before him, kept pace with him in everything until marriage pulled her away. Kannamma came when he was two. Timmamma arrived in 1330 and died in 1334, another small body carried out before sunrise.

Somayya did not speak softly to a boy with five sisters. He put a stick in Gopayya’s hand and sent him with goats before the sun was high enough to bite. Gopayya liked the road and the noise of other people’s work—women pounding grain, men shouting over a cart wheel, the quick arguments at the weekly market. By ten he could recognize the temple’s common words painted on a board and the simplest letters scratched by a village clerk; he could not write more than a few shapes, but he could pick out a name or a number when it mattered. He sat close to travelling storytellers at festival time and repeated their lines loudly afterward, correcting anyone who got them wrong.

When revenue demands rose in the late 1330s and early 1340s, Somayya pushed animals harder. He sent milk and ghee as dues when coin was short. Gopayya walked animals farther to find grazing, sometimes past boundary stones. He enjoyed bargaining for fodder and salt, and he enjoyed the talk that came with it. If another boy questioned him, he answered by stepping closer, smiling, and refusing to move.

At nineteen, in 1346, Somayya arranged his marriage to Chennadevi from a nearby village. The wedding brought turmeric paste, lamps, and a priest’s recitations, then a meal of rice and pulses on leaf plates. Gopayya liked the attention and the procession more than the domestic calm afterward. Chennadevi worked hard. She fed calves by hand when the mother cow refused, carried dung cakes to dry on the wall, and slept lightly with one ear for the pen. Gopayya praised her when she matched his pace and scolded her when she did not. In 1348 she gave birth to a son, Rangayya, who died the same day. The family took a small pot of milk and rice to the goddess’ stone and broke it there. Three years later another son, Kesavayya, died soon after birth. Chennadevi sat with the old women and followed their instructions: fasting, vows, offerings. Gopayya went out with the goats and returned late, angry at anyone who suggested he should be quieter.

Through the 1350s drought-lean years came and went. Grass thinned, wells dropped, and cattle grew bony at the ribs. Grain prices rose, and coin mattered more than Somayya liked. Gopayya began making longer circuits with the herds and spending more time at larger markets where merchants weighed salt and iron with small balances. He laughed easily there, slapped backs, and joined dice games behind a stall; he could lose a handful of cowries and still keep talking. His sisters married out in those years. Chennamma married into a settlement a walk away and learned the temper of her husband’s house; she still made room for Gopayya when he passed through, but she watched him sharply when he spoke too loudly near her courtyard.

Somayya died in 1366 after a short illness that left him too weak to rise. The household rites were done, and Gopayya took on the role of adult man without the older man’s restraint. He already drank at festivals. After Somayya’s death he drank on ordinary days: palm liquor when he could get it, sometimes spiced and thick. He came back from the market with a jar and a grin and then, later, a hard face when someone questioned him.

In 1364, before Somayya died, Gopayya began letting his goats and cattle graze at the edge of another hamlet’s scrub and then onto standing crops when the herd pressed forward. The first time men complained, he denied it and argued until voices rose, then claimed the grazing path was old and his father had used it. Rachanna, the account-keeper who handled disputes, listened and pushed for compensation. Gopayya turned the matter into a social fight, bringing laughter and insults into it, and he came away without paying more than a token. From 1364 through 1378 he repeated the tactic in lean seasons: graze, deny, intimidate, offer a small amount at most. As his dependence grew on a larger household, he shorted milk and ghee dues as well, keeping a little aside and claiming the yield was poor.

In 1367, at a temple festival day, he met Sunkamma. She was married to Kondayya, who travelled to sell grain and return with cloth. Gopayya began finding reasons to pass her lane: a message for someone else, a rope to buy, a goat to offer. The affair ran for six years. They met on market days, sometimes behind a granary wall, sometimes in a shed at the edge of fields. It sharpened his quarrels at home. Chennadevi demanded he sleep under their roof and stop disappearing at night. He answered with anger and refusals and drank more after each fight. In 1371 Chennadevi left and stayed with her natal kin. He made no formal repudiation. He simply did not bring her back, and he did not stop behaving as if the house still belonged to him.

Lakshmamma kept trying to manage it. She took food to Chennadevi once, bringing curds and a cloth, and came home with nothing solved. She told Gopayya to stop shaming the household. He responded by shouting at her in the yard where neighbors could hear. After that, Mallamma took over the role of speaking to him when she could. She scolded him in a low voice, with the steadiness of an older sister who had managed men all her life, and for a few days at a time he listened.

The affair with Sunkamma ended in 1373 after Kondayya returned unexpectedly and a cousin saw Gopayya near Sunkamma’s house at dusk. Gossip spread quickly. Gopayya did not hide. He turned it into another argument, mocking the men who confronted him and challenging them to prove anything. That boldness saved him from one kind of consequence and created another. People began to refuse him credit. When a small landholder wanted a herdsman, he chose someone quieter.

After Lakshmamma died in 1378, the last careful hand in his life disappeared. By then Gopayya had attached himself to Basavayya, a wealthier herd owner with land and men who could enforce their will. Basavayya used him as a mover of animals and a loud negotiator in markets. Gopayya kept careful counts of head and hoof when sober and could remember which goat belonged to which pen. Basavayya fed him and gave him a place to sleep near the animals. In return, Basavayya accepted that Gopayya drank and fought, as long as the work got done and trouble stayed manageable.

In 1375, 1379, 1382, and 1386, when he travelled to a larger market town to sell animals and buy grain and salt, Gopayya paid for sex. He brought small coins, sometimes a strip of cloth, sometimes liquor. The woman received him in a tucked-away room near the bazaar quarter where other men went quietly. He spoke to her as if it was another transaction. He left without tenderness and returned to the road before dawn, often with a sour mouth and an unsteady step.

Chennamma died in 1387. Mallamma died in 1395. Kannamma died in 1398. Each death narrowed the circle of people who argued with him as kin rather than as employer or neighbor. In Basavayya’s compound he grew older and rougher. He still enjoyed certain things: hot rice with sour tamarind broth, sitting on a low wall near the pens at dusk, listening for distant drums from a festival he might attend. He also kept grudges. A man who once accused him of grazing damage could be greeted years later with a sudden insult.

In May 1399, at seventy-two, he returned from a short errand with stomach cramps and watery stools. He drank water from a pot shared by others and could not keep food down. Basavayya’s women gave him rice water with salt and a bit of buttermilk. It did not stay in him. He died on May 15 with the heat already high.

His body was washed, a cloth wrapped around him, and a small pinch of ash and flowers placed near his head. Men carried him beyond the settlement and burned him on a wood pile, then gathered the ash and placed it in the earth with a final offering of rice.
