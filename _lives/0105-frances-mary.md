#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Financial disorganization and workplace temptations (skimming) during
#       tight times; later, son James becomes the family 'paperwork' person.
#     scene: Forgets appointments, loses track of bills, starts tasks (sewing, mending,
#       cleaning) and leaves them half-done; relies on bursts of energy before guests/church
#       to 'catch up.'
#     timing: Visible from adolescence; most consequential in young adulthood and early
#       marriage (1930s–1940s)
#     trait: Very low conscientiousness (8th percentile)
#   - consequence: Helps her navigate urban life and climb slightly in status despite
#       limited schooling; also makes her sensitive to hypocrisy and parish politics,
#       feeding later religious drift.
#     scene: Quick mental arithmetic and strong verbal understanding; can talk a customer
#       into a sale or calm an irate guest; reads selectively (recipes, advice columns)
#       and remembers useful details.
#     timing: School years onward; leveraged in service/retail work (1930s–1950s)
#     trait: High intelligence (80th percentile)
#   - consequence: Eases entry into service jobs and social networks that facilitate
#       migration and meeting Walter; adds social pressure to look 'put together' even
#       when money is tight.
#     scene: Receives attention and preferential treatment in stores and workplaces;
#       supervisors/customer interactions are friendlier; occasional gossip/resentment
#       from other women.
#     timing: Most prominent in late teens through early middle age (late 1920s–1950s)
#     trait: Very high physical attractiveness (96th percentile)
#   - consequence: Her lapse is not a quest for new spirituality but a retreat into
#       private, familiar practices; Vatican II feels unsettling rather than exciting.
#     scene: Prefers familiar routines and practical talk; skeptical of new devotional
#       fashions or later liturgical/Church innovations, even if she stops attending
#       regularly.
#     timing: Midlife, especially during religious-change years and Vatican II era (1950s–1960s)
#     trait: Low openness (24th percentile)
#   - consequence: Stops once finances stabilize; carries a quiet sense of shame that
#       makes her avoid confession during her later lapsed period.
#     scene: Feels guilty about taking money and keeps it small; compensates by generosity
#       to family and scrupulous fairness in non-money matters (e.g., returning lost
#       personal items).
#     timing: Skimming period (late 1930s–early 1940s) and afterward
#     trait: Higher honesty-humility (68th percentile) despite property crime incident
# number_of_children: '3'
# number_of_siblings: '7'
# occupation: Service work (waitress, hotel work, retail sales clerk)
# religion: Catholic practice (Mass weekly or near-weekly; occasional confession; daily

#     when money was tight.'
#   reasoning: Working/lower-middle class households sometimes engaged in minor rule-breaking
#     (petty theft, small fraud, benefit/tax misreporting), but many did not; her higher

#   reasoning: Practicing Catholics in this era often remained affiliated, but some

Frances Mary was born on January 27, 1911, on a small farm in the Town of Holland in La Crosse County, Wisconsin, in a state governed by U.S. law and county politics, where English-speaking, old-stock Catholic families marked weeks by Sunday Mass and the farming calendar. Her father, Patrick, worked land he did not talk about much except in terms of weather and debt. Her mother, Katherine, ran the house and yard on a schedule that never changed: wash water heated on the stove every Monday, bread dough covered with a towel, chickens counted at dusk, rosary beads kept in a drawer that stuck.

Evelyn, born in 1909, was already old enough to be trusted with small tasks when Frances arrived, and she acted older than her years. Frances spent her early childhood following Evelyn, imitating her, and then working alongside her—carrying pails, fetching kindling, keeping an eye on younger siblings while Katherine's hands were full. Dorothy came in 1913, close enough in age that the two girls shared a bed for years. Joseph, the only boy, was born in 1915 and treated as the farm’s future. Helen followed in 1917. Agnes arrived in 1919, Bernice in 1921, and Irene in 1924, the baby who felt, to Frances, like someone she helped raise rather than a sister she competed with.

When influenza swept through Wisconsin in 1918 and returned in waves, the family’s world narrowed to the house, barn, and church. School closed, then reopened; the parish still mattered even when people avoided crowds. Katherine boiled linens and kept windows cracked despite the cold. Frances learned early that rules changed without warning, and she carried that forward: she listened fast, reacted fast, and forgot just as fast.

She was quick with numbers and talk. At the country school she answered before other children had finished thinking, and then lost her pencil, misplaced her reader, and came home without the paper she was meant to return signed. Katherine scolded her, then put her to work anyway. Frances could peel potatoes while arguing a point, could calm a crying toddler with a song and a firm bounce on the hip. She also left half-mended socks in a basket and walked away from chores when her attention caught on something else.

The 1920s hit farm families hard in western Wisconsin. Prices fell. Patrick watched the accounts and took on extra work where he could, hauling or trading labor with neighbors. Frances reached adolescence in a house where flour sacks were saved and the same dress might be let out and re-hemmed more than once. She liked looking neat anyway. Her face and figure drew attention in town, and she knew how to use it without talking about it—standing straighter at the counter, smiling when she needed an answer, letting a compliment slide past without blushing. Bernice, younger and bold, later teased her for it, calling her “the picture girl” when Frances came home in a new hat.

Frances stopped school before the brightest students did. She could read simple things—a recipe, a note from a neighbor, a newspaper headline—but she wrote slowly and disliked it, and she hated being corrected. By the early 1930s, with the Depression tightening every household, she wanted paid work more than more schooling. She left Wisconsin in 1934 on a train with a small suitcase and a rosary in her pocket, following a lead to a larger city far from La Crosse County where jobs existed in hotels and stores.

She rented a room in a boarding house run by Mrs. Kowalski, who kept a strict kitchen and took payment on time. Frances learned to keep her hair tidy, to keep her uniform clean, to memorize orders and room numbers. She worked long shifts on her feet, carrying trays, folding linens, and dealing with customers who expected a woman to absorb their moods. Frances could talk her way out of trouble with a smile and a quick apology, but her carelessness cost her. She forgot to ring things up. She miscounted change. Mr. Ellis, her manager in a retail job she took after hotel work, watched her hands and her totals.

By 1938, money was tight in the household she was building with Walter, a steady man she met through work and neighborhood ties after they began courting in 1936. They married with a simple church wedding and a modest reception, and Frances went back to work when expenses pressed. She began taking small amounts from the till in 1939 and continued into 1942. Sometimes it was an under-rung sale for a friendly customer and the difference folded into her apron pocket. Sometimes it was coins skimmed when the drawer was opened for change. She kept it small because she could not stand the thought of being caught. She also kept it going because rent and groceries did not wait. At home she bought a little extra meat, or a new pair of shoes, and said nothing about how. By 1943, with Walter's job steadier and wartime wages higher, she stopped. The extra money was no longer worth the fear.

That same year, 1939, her first baby, Robert, was born and died in infancy. She returned to work with her face composed and her movements faster than they needed to be. At night she still said prayers, but confession began to feel like something she could not manage, not with the stealing and the anger she felt at how easily life took things away.

James arrived in 1941, as the country entered the war and ration books came into kitchens. Walter's job steadied, but nothing felt certain. Frances kept track of coupons poorly, mislaid the booklet once and found it in a drawer under towels, then laughed in a sharp burst that made Walter stare. She did her part: saving bacon fat in a tin, stretching leftovers, lining up for sugar. Mrs. Ramirez, a neighbor with children of her own, watched James some afternoons so Frances could work a shift. They traded favors back and forth—eggs for childcare, advice for company—and the arrangement held through the war years and beyond. In 1944 Frances gave birth to Patricia, and this time she stayed home longer, worn out by the combination of babies and work.

Letters went back to Wisconsin. Dorothy’s death in 1937 had already shaken her; Evelyn’s death in 1948 hit differently. Evelyn had been the one who knew the household routines and could tell Frances, without softness, what she owed the family. After Evelyn was gone, Frances’s visits back felt looser, more like stops than returns. Joseph wrote in a steady hand about the farm. Helen kept everyone informed. Irene, by then a young woman, wrote to Frances like a niece writes to an aunt, asking about city life.

The late 1940s and 1950s brought steadier money and a better address. Frances and Walter bought furniture on credit. She liked a kitchen with matching canisters and a table that didn’t wobble. She still misplaced bills, and James, as a teenager, learned to find the envelopes on the mantel and set them in a row for her. Frances worked again in service jobs—waitressing, then retail—where her looks helped and her quick talk soothed customers, even when she forgot an order and had to correct it on the fly. She enjoyed small pleasures that fit her schedule: coffee with a slice of pie after a shift, a radio program she never missed, sitting by a window in late afternoon light while she peeled apples for a pan of baked slices with cinnamon.

In 1955 she stopped going to Mass every week. It began with missed Sundays when she was tired, then stretched into months. Her parish had a stricter tone than the one she grew up with, and she clashed with Father O’Malley when he corrected her about confession and duties. She kept a small routine anyway. She made the sign of the cross before sleep. She kept holy water by the bed for a while. At Christmas and Easter she turned up, dressed well, hair pinned, and let the familiar words carry her through.

Frances took James and Patricia for their polio shots in the 1950s, complained about the waiting room, and then insisted they go anyway. She talked about sickness in a practical way. She never spoke about Robert except once, years later, when Patricia asked. She told her daughter the facts—a boy, born too soon, buried in a small plot—and then changed the subject.

When Vatican II reached parish life in the 1960s—English in the Mass, new music, new ways of speaking—Frances did not take it as liberation. It felt like another set of changes that required attention and patience. She returned more often after 1965, but she never regained the older habit of confession. She sat in the back with Mrs. Ramirez, a neighbor who had swapped childcare with her for years, and whispered comments that made them both snort once, quickly, before they composed themselves.

Patricia, by then a young woman, became the person Frances talked to about faith and doubt. James was practical and handled paperwork; Patricia listened. The two of them would sit at Frances's kitchen table after Sunday dinner, washing dishes slowly, and Frances would say things she never said to Walter or to her sisters back in Wisconsin—that she did not know what she believed anymore, that the new Mass felt like someone had rearranged her furniture, that she still crossed herself before sleep because her hands remembered it.

Patrick died in 1958. Frances took the train back to Wisconsin, sat through the funeral Mass, and returned to her city within the week. She had not been close to him in years.

Katherine's death in 1966 was different. Frances stayed longer that time, helping sort through the house, folding her mother's aprons and setting them in a box. She kept one, blue cotton with white trim, and brought it home. She never wore it, but she kept it in a drawer where she could find it. Before she left, she pressed a little cash into Irene's palm and told her to call if she needed anything.

By then her siblings' lives had settled into patterns. Joseph ran the family farm. Helen kept everyone informed through letters and phone calls, tracking birthdays and anniversaries. Agnes stayed in Wisconsin, still attending Mass weekly. Bernice had moved to a larger town and wore nice clothes when she visited. Frances spoke most often with Irene, the youngest, because Irene made it easy to admit confusion without feeling lectured.

By the early 1970s the children were grown and gone. Frances and Walter lived as a couple again in a quiet place, keeping the house in order in their uneven way—Walter steady, Frances leaving projects half finished and then completing them in a rush when company was expected. On June 2, 1974, she died at 63 of natural causes without a single clear explanation offered by those around her.

A Catholic funeral Mass was held, and her body was buried in a cemetery plot with a simple marker bearing “Frances Mary.” A rosary was placed in her hands before the coffin was closed.
