# ethnicity: Local northeast Iranian Bronze Age oasis/plateau agro‑pastoralists (BMAC/Oxus
#   interaction sphere or closely related)
# father_occupation: Absent/deceased/unknown (not a working presence during the child's
#   early years)
# historical_context:
# - event: Multi-year rainfall shortfalls affecting steppe pasture and wells (forcing
#     longer seasonal moves, herd stress, and heightened competition over water points)
#   timing: several episodes across adulthood; especially likely ages 15–25 and 40–55
# - event: Fluctuations in long-distance trade passing through the broader Oxus–Iranian
#     plateau corridor (changing access to metals, textiles, prestige goods, and demand
#     for pastoral products)
#   timing: most likely midlife; ages 30–55
# - event: Severe winter/cold-snap years causing animal mortality and human respiratory
#     illness (freeze damage, fodder shortages, increased pneumonia risk)
#   timing: sporadic; more consequential in later adulthood, ages 50–67
# household_social_status: Ordinary free household (typical smallholder agro‑pastoralists;
#   neither notably rich nor poor)
# household_structure_at_birth: Mother-headed household (father deceased/absent at birth;
#   supported by her natal or affinal kin)
# household_structure_at_death: Extended multigenerational patrilocal household (elder
#   man with wife and at least one married adult son plus grandchildren/other kin in

#   possibly widower at death)
# mental_disorder: No clear mental disorder (within a typical/functional range for the
#   setting, despite some shyness/low drive)
# migration: Short-range relocation within the broader region (moved household to another
#   community within ~20–100 km, likely via marriage/kin ties or land/water access)
# mother_occupation: Household agro‑pastoral laborer and manager (childcare, food processing,
#   tending small stock, field/garden work with kin support)
# narrative_plan:
#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: -1802
#     name: Tima
#     narrative_role: Primary caregiver in a mother-headed household; capable, strict,
#       and emotionally steady. Relationship is warm but unsentimental—she teaches Hadu
#       quiet endurance and the routines of animals, water, and kin obligations. Dies
#       when Hadu is about 32, before his later marriages settle.
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: -1790
#     name: Aruk
#     narrative_role: Adult male protector who periodically anchors the household’s
#       standing with other lineages and organizes watch/escort duties. Hadu respects
#       him but keeps distance; Aruk pushes Hadu into militia service. Dies when Hadu
#       is about 44.
#     role: maternal uncle (mother’s brother)
#   - death_year: -1816
#     name: Sena
#     narrative_role: Early childhood caregiver while Tima works; provides stories and
#       ritual routines at the hearth. Hadu is attached to her calm presence; her death
#       (Hadu ~18) coincides with drought pressure and his first larger responsibilities.
#     role: maternal grandmother
#   - death_year: -1835
#     name: null
#     narrative_role: Not a raising presence; spoken of cautiously. His absence shapes
#       Hadu’s early shyness and reliance on maternal kin for protection and status.
#     role: father (absent/deceased)
#   children:
#   - birth_year: -1816
#     death_age: 37
#     death_year: -1779
#     name: Suli
#     narrative_role: Eldest child; capable helper in dairy and textiles, often mediating
#       between Hadu and more assertive kin. Dies in mid-adulthood (likely childbirth
#       or infection), which hardens Hadu’s fear of loss and makes him cling to routine.

#     death_year: -1814
#     name: Nara

#   - birth_year: -1810
#     death_age: 61
#     death_year: -1749
#     name: Tesh
#     narrative_role: Long-lived daughter; marries into a nearby household but remains
#       a key conduit of news and help. In old age she returns often, bringing grandchildren
#       and practical support.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -1808
#     death_age: 60
#     death_year: -1748
#     name: Darek
#     narrative_role: First surviving son; steady worker, inherits primary responsibility
#       for core herd and water access. Adult co-resident in the extended household
#       at Hadu’s death.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: -1806
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: -1806
#     name: Vanu

#   - birth_year: -1802
#     death_age: 1
#     death_year: -1801
#     name: Kesh
#     narrative_role: Dies during a harsh year (winter illness/diarrhea); remembered
#       as a sign to keep closer to kin and water sources.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: -1799
#     death_age: 50
#     death_year: -1749
#     name: Rishan
#     narrative_role: Younger surviving son; more restless and prone to risk, often
#       pushing for longer pasture moves and taking part in watch/escort work. As an
#       adult he helps maintain the household’s security posture.
#     sex: M
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 19
#     connection: Triggered by drought-era insecurity and maternal-uncle Aruk’s insistence
#       that the household must contribute armed labor for route and herd protection.
#     incident: military_service
#   - age: 20
#     connection: Seasonal call-up continues; Hadu’s role is watch/escort rather than
#       leadership due to low extraversion.
#     incident: military_service
#   - age: 21
#     connection: Occurs during the same general insecurity period; the ransom payment
#       draws on kin obligations and slightly increases later pressure for Hadu to prove
#       himself.
#     incident: captive
#   - age: 28
#     connection: Linked to pasture/water competition during lingering dry years; contributes
#       to a lasting feud that shapes where he later relocates his home base.
#     incident: physical_assault_perp
#   - age: 35
#     connection: Occurs after relocation when a dependent young woman is attached to
#       the household during a hardship year; his authority and her vulnerability intersect
#       in the isolated context of seasonal camp.
#     incident: sexual_violence_perp
#   - age: 50
#     connection: Spouse’s wasting illness reduces household labor; contributes to decision
#       to remarry soon after spouse’s death and to consolidate into an extended multigenerational
#       household.
#     incident: sick_relative
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6
#     key_events:
#     - Raised in a mother-headed household; learns early to be quiet and observant
#       while women and maternal kin run daily work.
#     - 'First remembered drought-stress signs: long walks for water, thinner animals,
#       more tension at wells.'
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 7-18
#     key_events:
#     - Takes on herding tasks early, often paired with uncle/cousins; develops a habit
#       of keeping to the edge of groups.
#     - 'Multi-year rainfall shortfall intensifies (ages ~15-18): longer seasonal moves,
#       more disputes at water points.'
#     - Death of grandmother Sena (age ~18) just as he is pulled into adult responsibilities.
#     phase: Later childhood/adolescence
#   - age_range: 19-30
#     key_events:
#     - Joins local levy/militia rotations to escort herds and routes (ages 19-22).
#     - Captured during a return from pasture and ransomed by kin (age 21).
#     - Marries first wife Lami (age 17-18 by year count; socially could be early 20s;
#       set to year -1817 for consistency) and begins independent herd management; first
#       surviving child soon after.
#     phase: Young adulthood
#   - age_range: 31-50
#     key_events:
#     - Short-range relocation to a better-watered circuit/affinal-linked hamlet (around
#       ages 31-33), aligning with trade fluctuations and pasture pressure.
#     - Serious fight at a watering place escalates tensions with a neighboring herding
#       group (age 27-28; placed earlier but continues to shape later relations).
#     - Single-season coercive sexual incident involving a dependent young woman in
#       camp (age 34-36), followed by quiet settlement/avoidance rather than public
#       reckoning.
#     phase: Mid-adulthood
#   - age_range: 51-67
#     key_events:
#     - Prolonged caregiving for a spouse with fever/wasting (ages 49-51) overlaps with
#       renewed dry years and strains household labor.
#     - Death of first wife Lami (around -1786; Hadu ~48-49) and remarriage to Rina
#       (-1785) to maintain household stability.
#     - Cold-snap winters in later years (ages ~55-67) increase animal losses and respiratory
#       illness; he withdraws further, ceding outward negotiations to sons.
#     phase: Later adulthood and old age
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Shurak
#     prominence: age 27-33; represents ongoing inter-lineage tension and later avoidance/relocation
#       pressures
#     relationship: neighboring herder involved in the watering-place dispute
#   - name: Yema
#     prominence: age 34-36; central to the coercion incident and its quiet aftermath
#     relationship: dependent young woman attached to Hadu’s camp (kin-poor survivor
#       of hardship)
#   - name: Korin
#     prominence: age 19-22; ties Hadu’s household obligations to wider security demands
#     relationship: militia band leader/kin elder coordinating escorts and retaliatory
#       raids
#   - name: Belu
#     prominence: age 21; appears during captivity and ransom negotiations
#     relationship: raider-camp intermediary/negotiator involved in ransom arrangements
#   partners:
#   - name: Lami
#     narrative_role: First wife from a nearby hamlet; pragmatic marriage that stabilizes
#       Hadu’s position after early militia years. Relationship is cooperative but emotionally
#       quiet—she manages household production while he ranges with flocks. Her death
#       after years of intermittent illness leaves Hadu cautious and more inward.
#     relationship_end_year: -1786
#     relationship_start_year: -1817
#   - name: Rina
#     narrative_role: Second wife, married soon after Lami’s death to re-knit labor
#       and childcare; more forceful and socially active, often speaking for the household.
#       Their relationship is workable but tense at times—Rina presses him to engage;
#       Hadu prefers silence. She is the spouse he is most likely still living with
#       at his death.
#     relationship_end_year: -1766
#     relationship_start_year: -1785
#   siblings:
#   - birth_year: -1832
#     death_age: 70
#     death_year: -1762
#     name: Marek
#     narrative_role: Younger brother and closest male peer; more socially forward than
#       Hadu, often the one who negotiates with other households. Their bond is practical—sharing
#       herding work and later coordinating marriages and herd splits—yet strained by
#       Hadu’s tendency to withdraw and Marek’s impatience with hesitation.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Lower influence in disputes and alliances; increases reliance on
#       more outgoing kin to represent the household, and contributes to unresolved
#       shame after wrongdoing.
#     scene: At wellside negotiations he hangs back, speaking only when pressed, letting
#       brother/uncle/sons argue; in camp he prefers silent tasks (checking fetlocks,
#       mending straps) over communal storytelling.
#     timing: most visible from adolescence through old age
#     trait: Very low Extraversion (10th percentile)
#   - consequence: More friction with spouses (especially Rina) and sons; occasional
#       material losses that keep the household 'ordinary' rather than prospering.
#     scene: He delays repairs and puts off careful tallying of animals; minor neglect
#       (loose tether, late bedding) repeatedly creates small crises that others must
#       patch.
#     timing: young adulthood through midlife
#     trait: Low Conscientiousness (19th percentile)
#   - consequence: Generally trusted and seen as fair, but his rare explosive moments
#       are memorable and damaging.
#     scene: He yields in many everyday conflicts—accepting less favorable exchanges
#       to keep peace—then later erupts when cornered (as at the watering-place fight).
#     timing: adulthood
#     trait: High Agreeableness (80th percentile)
#   - consequence: Builds a reputation for being 'straight' in ordinary dealings, which
#       helps kin mobilize support during crises (e.g., ransom, illness care).
#     scene: He is uncomfortable with boastful war talk and refuses to exaggerate kills
#       or raids; he returns found tools/animals when he can without risking his household.
#     timing: young adulthood onward
#     trait: High Honesty-Humility (70th percentile)
#   - consequence: Missed opportunities for profit or prestige goods; reinforces stable
#       but unremarkable standing.
#     scene: He resists experimenting with new routes or novel exchange practices even
#       when trade patterns shift; he prefers inherited seasonal circuits and rituals.
#     timing: midlife during trade fluctuations
#     trait: Low Openness (24th percentile)
#   - consequence: Delegates negotiation/strategy to brother and later sons; may be
#       easier to pressure in disputes.
#     scene: He struggles with complex multi-party bargaining and remembering layered
#       obligations; he does best with concrete tasks (animal care, route memory).
#     timing: adolescence through adulthood
#     trait: Below-average Intelligence (29th percentile, not pathological)
# number_of_children: '7'
# number_of_siblings: '1'
# occupation: Primarily herder/pastoralist (sheep/goats/cattle; seasonal transhumance
#   but with a home base)
# religion: 'Household hearth/altar cult: daily or frequent offerings (food/drink),
#   incense/burning, short spoken prayers for family, herds, and crops'
# sibling_ages_at_death:
# - 70
# sibling_sexes:
# - M
# structured_incidents:
# - event: During a seasonal herding circuit, he used his authority as an older household
#     man to coerce a young woman attached to his camp (a dependent relative/servant
#     taken in after hardship), forcing sex under threat of being sent away without
#     protection or provisions.
#   reasoning: Sexual coercion certainly existed, but for an ordinary high-agreeableness/high-honesty
#     man the base rate is lower than for general male violence, and there is no other
#     strong signal pointing specifically to sexual predation.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 34–36 (late spring/summer of one herding season); single event
#   type: sexual_violence_perp
# - event: In a dispute at a watering place over grazing rights and a missing lamb,
#     he struck another herder with a staff and kicked him while others pulled them
#     apart, leaving the man bruised and limping for days.
#   reasoning: The most typical form of perpetration would be a serious fight, beating,
#     or coercive physical force (including within household discipline or conflict),
#     and his pastoral/warfare exposure increases opportunity.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 27–28; single event (serious fight)
#   type: physical_assault_perp
# - event: He spent months caring for a spouse with recurring fever and wasting—arranging
#     shelter near water, assigning daughters/kin to bring broth and milk, and taking
#     over her daily tasks until she either recovered partially or died.
#   reasoning: In multigenerational households with limited medical care, prolonged
#     tending of illness/injury was common, especially for elders and spouses; living
#     to 67 increases the chance he cared for someone over months.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 49–51; sustained period (many months)
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: He served in a local levy/militia assembled by kin leaders to escort herds
#     and defend the oasis-route against raiders, standing night watch and joining a
#     retaliatory raid to recover stolen animals.
#   reasoning: Formal standing armies are uncertain here, but adult men often had militia/raid-defense
#     duties; as a pastoralist on a frontier, participation in armed defense or raiding
#     parties is fairly likely.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 19–22; sustained period (several seasonal call-ups)
#   type: military_service
# - event: On a return from highland pasture, his small party was ambushed and he was
#     taken alive; he was held in a raiders’ camp and later released after his kin negotiated
#     a ransom paid in livestock and textiles.
#   reasoning: Capture/enslavement occurred in raiding systems, but for an adult male
#     with continuing family life and ordinary standing it’s a minority outcome (though
#     short-term capture/ransom is possible).
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 21; sustained period (several weeks)
#   type: captive
---

Hadu was born into an oasis-edge community on the desert basins of the northeastern Iranian plateau, where small hamlets and pasture camps sat within reach of caravan tracks linking the Oxus world to the west. Local leaders settled disputes and organized escorts; no distant court managed daily life. His people spoke an unwritten local tongue, and they kept the household cult at the hearth with food, milk, and smoke offerings to ancestors and protective spirits.

His father was already gone when he was born. Tima, his mother, ran the household with help from her own kin. In the morning she set a pinch of grain by the hearth and poured a little milk on the packed earth, speaking names of dead relatives that Hadu learned before he could manage a sling. Sena, his grandmother, watched him when Tima went out to the animals. She taught him to keep quiet when older people talked and to look at a man’s hands before trusting his words. Hadu took to solitary tasks early. He liked sitting on a low ridge near the camp and counting animals as they returned at dusk, not because he was good at numbers, but because the rhythm calmed him.

Marek was born when Hadu was two. Marek grew into a boy who ran to the edge of arguments to hear them better, while Hadu stayed near the animals. When they were old enough to take small flocks out, Hadu walked behind and Marek went ahead. If a dog chased a hare, Marek laughed. Hadu watched the dog’s paws and checked the straps on the feed bag.

In Hadu’s teens the rains failed for several years. Wells sank lower and the grass line pulled back. Men argued longer at the watering places; young boys were told to keep stones in their slings and to stay within sight. Hadu’s household leaned on Aruk, Tima’s brother, who spoke for them when other lineages pressed too hard. Sena died when Hadu was eighteen. She was buried on a low rise with a small bowl and a strip of cloth. After that, Tima did not let Hadu linger at the hearth in the mornings. She sent him out early to scout water and to watch for thieves.

At nineteen Aruk pushed him into the escort bands that guarded herds moving between pasture and hamlets. Korin, an older man with scars on his forearm, organized the watches. Hadu carried a spear and a hide shield and stood in the cold hours before dawn while others slept. He did not talk much around the fire and he did not join in the boasting. When men pressed him to describe a skirmish, he gave short answers and turned to tightening a strap or sharpening a point.

At twenty-one, returning from high pasture with a small party, he was taken in an ambush. The raiders stripped him of his weapon and bound his wrists with twisted fiber. In their camp he kept his eyes down and followed orders quickly. Belu, an intermediary who spoke in several tongues, carried messages between camps. After several weeks, Aruk and other kin arrived with a ransom: animals and a bolt of woven cloth. Hadu walked home thin and quiet, and for a long time he slept with his knife near his hand.

Marriage came early in his adult life. At seventeen, the year before Sena died, Tima had already arranged a match with Lami from a nearby hamlet; the union was sealed with food shared between households and a new cord tied at the hearth. The household remained tied to Tima’s kin, but Hadu’s wife brought labor and connections. Lami did not ask for stories. She worked. She spun thread by the doorway, turned milk into sour curds, and pushed him to trade for salt when supplies ran low. Their first child, Suli, was born when Hadu was nineteen. He held the infant briefly and then went out to check a ewe that was lambing.

Two years later Nara was born and died the same day. Lami washed the child and wrapped her, and Tima placed a small dab of fat at the hearth before they carried the bundle out. Hadu kept away from the women’s talk afterward. He focused on repairing a broken waterskin, even though Marek told him to stop fussing and drink.

The early years of fatherhood did not smooth Hadu’s temper; it compressed it. At twenty-eight, at a crowded watering place, Shurak accused him of taking a lamb that had strayed. Hadu tried to step back and let Marek speak, but Shurak grabbed at his arm. Hadu struck him with his staff and then kicked him when he fell. Men pulled them apart. Shurak limped for days. After that, their groups avoided each other when possible, and when they could not, they came armed and tense.

In his early thirties Hadu moved his home base to a better-watered circuit connected through affinal ties. Trade caravans came more often for a stretch, and metal tools and bright beads passed through hands, but he did not chase them. He disliked bargaining. Marek handled exchanges when he visited, and later Darek, Hadu’s first surviving son, learned to do the talking.

Hadu’s daughters came in quick succession: Tesh at twenty-four, Vanu at twenty-eight. Vanu died at birth. Lami did not cry loudly; she became more exacting about offerings. She burned aromatics when she could get them and insisted on a small portion of every first milk at the hearth. A son, Darek, had been born two years before Vanu, and he grew sturdy. Another son, Kesh, arrived when Hadu was thirty-two and died at one during a harsh winter illness.

When Hadu was thirty-five, a young woman named Yema entered his camp as a dependent, sent by distant kin after a year of shortage. During a summer herding season, with the camp stretched thin and the older women busy, Hadu used his authority over provisions and protection. He pressed her into sex under threat of casting her out without food or escort. Afterward he avoided her gaze and spoke to her only in commands. Yema stayed on, quiet and watchful, until kin moved her elsewhere at the end of the season.

Rishan, Hadu’s youngest surviving son, was born when Hadu was thirty-six. Rishan grew into a boy who wanted to range farther than he was told. When Hadu tried to rein him in, he used short orders and then withdrew, leaving discipline to Lami and later to Rina. Suli, the eldest, became the one who could get her father to speak more than a few words. She teased him about how he ate the browned crust from flatbread first, saving the soft center for last. He gave her a tight smile and pretended not to hear.

Tima died when Hadu was thirty-two. Her death loosened the last firm tie to his childhood. Aruk still visited and still carried weight in gatherings, but Hadu did not seek him out. Aruk died when Hadu was forty-four. By then Darek could manage a herd segment, and Marek had his own household.

Lami’s health broke after years of intermittent fever. When Hadu was fifty, the illness became constant. He moved the sleeping area closer to water, kept broth and milk coming, and set Suli and Tesh to bring clean cloths and warm stones. He was clumsy at planning, forgetting tasks until someone reminded him, but he stayed near her and did not leave for long circuits. Lami died the next year. Within months Hadu married Rina, a woman who spoke plainly and did not wait for him to decide. She argued for consolidating the household and for keeping Darek and his wife under the same compound. Hadu accepted it without debate.

Suli died at thirty-seven, leaving children of her own in another household. Hadu did not travel for the burial; Rina went with textiles and dairy goods, and Darek represented the household. Hadu spent that day mending harness and checking the fence lines, then placed an extra portion of milk at the hearth in the evening.

In later years cold winters came hard. Animals died in the night if the wind shifted. Hadu coughed more, and his joints stiffened after long rides. He stopped going far with the herds. Rishan took the riskier circuits; Darek kept the core animals near reliable water. Tesh visited often with grown children, bringing news and bundles of cloth. Marek, already grey, still talked too much for Hadu’s taste. They sat together sometimes at dusk, chewing dried meat and watching dogs circle the edge of the compound. Marek made jokes about old men and stiff knees; Hadu gave short replies but stayed for the shared silence.

At sixty-seven, after a spell of weakness, Hadu caught an illness that left him unable to rise for long. He lay inside the compound while others worked, and he took little but broth and water. He died in late summer. His family washed him and laid him in the ground near other kin, setting a small bowl and a bit of bread beside him and pouring a last libation of milk onto the earth.
