#     name: Arif
#     narrative_role: Youngest; his death becomes a quiet wound and an organizing memory

#     sex: M
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 33
#     connection: Occurs after years of managing household budgets; increases her mistrust

#       schedules, diet control).
#     incident: chronic_illness

#     death_age: null
#     death_year: null
#     name: Naeem
#     narrative_role: More educated/aspiring brother; pushes for mobility and 'modern'
#       solutions. Their bond is warm but strained when he critiques her smoking/chewing
#       habit and her rigid routines.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1982
#     death_age: null
#     death_year: null
#     name: Jamal
#     narrative_role: Youngest; she was a second mother to him. In adulthood he is protective,
#       sometimes hot-tempered, and becomes involved in neighborhood security concerns
#       during the 2000s.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Earns respect and trust in both natal and marital households, but
#       creates friction (others feel criticized; she struggles to delegate when widowed).
#     scene: 'Runs the household like a ledger: fixed meal times, swept courtyard before
#       dawn, children’s uniforms checked, savings envelope hidden and counted; she
#       insists on repeating tasks until ''done properly.'''
#     timing: Most visible from adolescence through midlife (ages ~14–45)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (very high)
#   - consequence: Limits educational/occupational change and increases reliance on
#       tradition; avoidance narrows her world after security incidents.
#     scene: Resists new foods, new routes, and new ideas (e.g., modern parenting advice,
#       women’s work outside home); prefers familiar religious healers and customary
#       solutions over experimentation.
#     timing: Adolescence onward (ages ~15–present), intensifying after the bazaar theft
#       and atrocity exposure
#     trait: Openness (very low)
#   - consequence: Improves survival within joint-family politics but contributes to
#       conflict with a more principled sibling/child who dislikes manipulation.
#     scene: 'Status- and reputation-conscious: sharp about who is ''respectable,''
#       pushes children to maintain family image, and can be strategically flattering
#       to elders to secure support; privately keeps some money decisions opaque.'
#     timing: Married adulthood (ages ~20–50)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (low)
#   - consequence: Family sees her as 'strong,' but she processes distress somatically
#       (sleep disruption, headaches) rather than emotional disclosure.
#     scene: In crises (curfews, illness, child fever) she stays outwardly steady, speaks
#       in short practical instructions, and suppresses visible panic.
#     timing: Throughout adulthood, especially 2007–2014
#     trait: Neuroticism (low)
#   - consequence: Health complications and family conflict; secrecy/denial behaviors
#       (hiding use, brushing teeth/mouth fresheners) strain trust.
#     scene: Uses cigarettes or naswar repeatedly through the day, especially after
#       chores and during stress; continues despite scolding from children and medical
#       advice, spending small but persistent amounts of household money and worsening
#       blood pressure/diabetes control.
#     timing: Develops/solidifies in adulthood (approx. ages ~25–present), escalates
#       after infant loss (2009) and widowhood (2010)
#     trait: Substance use disorder (nicotine) with impairment
#   - consequence: Increases dependence on male kin/older children for bureaucracy and
#       healthcare navigation.
#     scene: Can read simple Urdu/Pashto text and signs, but avoids forms; uses thumbprints
#       or asks others to fill documents; relies on children to read medicine labels
#       once vision declines.
#     timing: From adolescence onward; becomes critical after 2020
#     trait: Partial literacy (reads more than writes)
# number_of_children: '6'
# number_of_siblings: '3'
# occupation: Homemaker/household manager (unpaid domestic work as primary role)
# religion: 'Sunni Muslim with popular/Sufi-leaning practices: du''a at shrines, milad/naat
#   gatherings, use of ta''wiz, saint veneration alongside basic Sunni duties'

# structured_incidents:
# - event: While shopping in a crowded bazaar in her new KP town, her purse was cut
#     and cash meant for household expenses disappeared; afterward she avoided going
#     alone and kept money pinned inside her clothing.
#   reasoning: Urban and peri-urban life in KP plus periodic instability raises exposure
#     to theft/fraud/robbery; even without being wealthy, most households experience
#     at least one such incident over decades.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Age 33 (2006); single event
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: During a neighborhood dispute that flared after an evening security incident,
#     she was struck and shoved by a woman from another household when she tried to
#     pull her younger sister-in-law back inside; she had bruising for days but did
#     not go to police.
#   reasoning: Urban KP saw periodic street and political violence; women are less exposed
#     than men, but assaults during unrest, family disputes, or neighborhood conflict
#     occur.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 36–37 (2009–2010); single event
#   type: physical_assault
# - event: She developed type 2 diabetes with high blood pressure and recurring dizziness;
#     managing diet and medicines became a constant part of her daily routine, and she
#     sometimes missed chores when her sugar dropped.
#   reasoning: By middle age in Pakistan, chronic conditions like hypertension, diabetes,
#     chronic pain, or depression-related somatic syndromes are common; repeated pregnancies
#     and stress can contribute.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 41 onward (2014–present); sustained period
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: Her vision deteriorated from diabetic eye disease, leaving her unable to
#     read fine print and making cooking and sewing difficult; she began relying on
#     older children to read medicine labels and bills aloud.
#   reasoning: Some chronic illness or injury results in lasting impairment (vision
#     problems, hearing loss, mobility limitation), but outright disabling outcomes
#     are less common than non-disabling chronic disease.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 47–48 (2020–2021); sustained period
#   type: acquired_disability
# - event: After a bombing/shooting in a public area near the market road, she arrived
#     shortly after and saw bodies and severely wounded people being loaded into vehicles,
#     including a child; she had nightmares and avoided that route for months.
#   reasoning: Firsthand witnessing of killings or torture is less common than general
#     exposure, but in conflict-affected areas it can occur (e.g., seeing bodies after
#     an attack).
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 38–39 (2011–2012); single event
#   type: witnessed_atrocity

Nasreen was born on September 27, 1973, in Hayatabad on the edge of Peshawar, in Pakistan’s North-West Frontier Province. The city sat close to the Afghan border, and politics reached into ordinary courtyards: military governments in Islamabad, clerics and parties arguing over public morality, and, later, the long war next door. Her family spoke Pashto at home and Urdu outside, and they prayed as Sunni Muslims in the Hanafi way, with the extra practices that filled many Pashtun houses—naat cassettes, milad gatherings, and folded paper amulets pinned inside clothing.

She entered a joint household ruled by her paternal grandfather, Baba Jan, and managed by her grandmother, Ana Bibi. Her father, Haji Abdul Karim, taught in a local school and kept a strict order. In the morning he read the newspaper in Urdu, and Nasreen learned not to cross in front of him. Her mother, Bibi Gul, ran the kitchen with help and competition from other women under the same roof.

Nasreen’s earliest memories were of rules. Water carried in metal pots. Charpoys shifted out of the way before sweeping. Bread dough covered so it would not dry. When she made a mistake, Ana Bibi did not shout; she flicked her ear or slapped her hand and pointed back at the task. Nasreen learned quickly and did not argue. She liked the neatness of a finished floor and the quiet hour after fajr when the men had gone out and the house was briefly hers.

Fazal was born in 1976, then Naeem in 1979, then Jamal in 1982. Nasreen was the oldest and the only girl. By eight, she could bathe a baby with one hand and stir lentils with the other. The men called her “Mashar,” eldest, in a tone that was half affection and half instruction. When she went to school she kept her books wrapped in brown paper, edges taped, pencils sharpened to a point. She read better than she wrote. She copied slowly and hated crossing out words, so she often waited until she was sure before putting pen to page.

Outside the house, Peshawar changed. During Zia-ul-Haq’s rule, sermons about proper behavior grew louder, and Nasreen’s father tightened his expectations. Then refugees came from Afghanistan after the Soviet invasion. The city filled with new faces and new markets. Men spoke more openly about guns and factions. Nasreen’s mother began keeping a ta’wiz sewn into the lining of Nasreen’s dress when she went out. On Thursdays, Bibi Gul sometimes took her to a shrine on the outskirts, where women tied threads to the grill and whispered du‘a for protection and good marriages.

Baba Jan died in 1986. The household’s center of gravity shifted, but the joint family remained. Ana Bibi held the keys and made Nasreen stand with her when guests arrived, passing tea and checking that the cups were clean. When Ana Bibi died in 1992, the women’s hierarchy loosened. Nasreen felt it as extra work: more arguing about who would wash dishes, more chances for things to be done badly.

Marriage negotiations began the year before Ana Bibi died. Nasreen was seventeen, short and plain-faced, and had already stopped regular schooling. She could read signs and simple letters, and she could recite and follow Urdu radio dramas, but writing longer passages was slow and tiring. In 1991 she married Saeed Khan, a man from another town in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. She left Peshawar with a trunk of clothes, quilts, and kitchen items and entered a new joint family with new rules. The first months were a series of tests: how she cooked rice, how she greeted elders, whether she rose before everyone else. She watched the other women carefully, noted who had the mother-in-law's ear, and made herself useful to the ones who mattered.

Imran arrived in 1993. Bilal followed in 1995, then Ayesha in 1998. Nasreen’s days filled with cooking, washing, and managing children in a house where privacy was limited and quarrels carried. She developed a habit of holding a small tin of tobacco—naswar—wrapped in cloth in the back of a cupboard. After the morning rush she took a pinch, then rinsed her mouth carefully. She told herself it steadied her. Over the years it became a fixed part of her day, and she grew sharp when anyone touched the cupboard.

After 9/11, her town tightened. Security checkpoints appeared, and rumors moved faster than facts. Usman was born in 2001. When he was small, Saeed began coming home late, tense from roadblocks and news of attacks. Nasreen did not ask many questions. She kept to her routines, kept the children fed, pressed their clothes, and sent them to school when it was open. When her father died in 2004, she traveled back to Peshawar for the funeral, sat with women behind a curtain, and listened to the Qur’an recitation. The loss took away her easiest source of support outside her husband’s family.

Zara was born later in 2004. Nasreen’s household felt full, and she counted money more carefully. In 2006 she went to a crowded bazaar to buy cloth and cooking oil. Someone cut her purse. The cash for that week’s expenses disappeared without a sound. She went home furious with herself. After that she pinned notes inside her kameez with a safety pin and refused to go to the market alone. If a neighbor insisted on going together, Nasreen chose early morning when the lanes were less packed.

Swat’s conflict pushed displaced families toward KP’s towns in 2007 and 2008. Lines got longer at clinics. Rents rose. Saeed argued with his brothers about money. Nasreen kept her voice even, but she tightened the household rules: children washed hands twice, shoes lined up, no lingering outside. Arif was born in 2008, a quiet baby with a weak appetite. He died in 2009 after a short illness that turned into fever and diarrhea. Nasreen washed him, wrapped him, and sat with women while men carried him away. Afterward she kept a ta’wiz tied above the doorway and attended milad gatherings more often, lips moving as the women sang naat softly.

In 2010, Saeed died, suddenly and without the long preparation a household expects. Nasreen became a widow with five living children. The respect she received was real—women lowered their voices around her, men spoke to her through intermediaries—but dependence came with it. She held her posture straight when in-laws discussed expenses. She also began using tobacco more openly, saying it helped her sleep.

A year later, violence reached closer. After an evening security incident—an explosion and gunfire on a road people used—neighbors poured into the lane, shouting questions and accusations. A dispute flared between households. Nasreen grabbed Shazia, her husband’s younger sister, by the wrist to pull her back inside. Gul Bano from the next house struck Nasreen and shoved her hard against a wall. Nasreen did not hit back. She steadied herself, dragged Shazia indoors, and shut the door. Bruises darkened on her arm and shoulder. She told no police, only her brother Fazal, who came the next day and stood in the lane with his jaw clenched.

In 2012, a bombing hit near a market road she used. She arrived soon after, thinking of errands, and saw bodies and wounded people being loaded into cars and pickups. A child’s face was gray with dust. That night she washed her hands again and again and said ayat al-kursi under her breath. For months she refused that route and snapped at anyone who suggested it was safe.

Diabetes and high blood pressure were diagnosed in 2014. Dr. Farah told her to cut down on sweets and stop tobacco. Nasreen nodded, kept the paper, and asked her son to read it aloud later because she did not like filling forms at the clinic. She followed the medicine schedule precisely for a week, then slipped back into old eating patterns when guests came or stress rose. She took her pills most days, though, counted them, and scolded the children if a bottle was moved.

Her mother, Bibi Gul, died in 2016. Nasreen traveled to Peshawar for the funeral and sat with the women again, as she had for her father twelve years before. The house in Hayatabad felt smaller without her mother's voice in the kitchen. Nasreen returned to her own household and resumed her routines.

By 2020 her eyesight blurred. She could no longer read fine print, not even the simple Urdu she once handled. Dr. Farah said the diabetes had reached her eyes. Nasreen began calling Imran to read medicine labels and utility bills. Zara learned to handle phone calls and appointment dates. That loss of control irritated Nasreen; she responded by making more lists in her head, repeating instructions, checking the spice jars and the rice tin as if they might have shifted when she looked away.

In 2025 she lives in the same KP town where she married, in a household that still feels joint even when people sleep under separate roofs. She prays, prepares food, and attends women’s milad gatherings when her health allows, sitting against a wall with her dupatta pinned tight. She keeps naswar in the cupboard and thinks she hides it, though the children smell it. In the afternoon she sits where the light is strongest and asks Ayesha to read messages that arrive on a phone. When the call to maghrib comes, she stands carefully, checks the latch on the gate, and goes back to the small tasks that keep the house running.
