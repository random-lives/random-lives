#     incident: domestic_violence
#   - age: 29
#     connection: Recurring pattern continues; conflicts center on accusations that

#       grain and her reputation as a healer.
#     incident: domestic_violence
#   - age: 69
#     connection: After widowhood and living alone, a nearby household offers help and

#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds a reputation as capable and fearless, gaining access to information
#       and work as a midwife, but also creates enemies and fuels marital jealousy/conflict.
#     scene: At births and church feasts, Zoe takes charge—directing women, bargaining
#       loudly with men over supplies, and volunteering opinions unasked.
#     timing: adolescence through middle adulthood (ages 15-55)
#     trait: Extraversion (very high)
#   - consequence: Social ties fray; fewer allies when she becomes poor and widowed,
#       increasing vulnerability to exploitation and neglect.
#     scene: Public quarrels over shared ovens, water, or gleaning rights; she uses
#       cutting remarks and refuses quick reconciliation rituals unless she feels fully
#       vindicated.
#     timing: young adulthood into widowhood (ages 20-70)
#     trait: Agreeableness (very low)
#   - consequence: Keeps her anchored in community norms (protecting legitimacy) but
#       limits flexibility when circumstances change; contributes to rigid thinking
#       during depressive episodes.
#     scene: She insists on 'the proper way' taught by her mother and the priest—set
#       prayers, familiar remedies, and customary fasting—mocking novel practices or
#       outsiders’ methods.
#     timing: all phases, especially adulthood (ages 18-77)
#     trait: Openness (very low)
#   - consequence: Short-term gains in bargaining; longer-term reputation for being
#       'sharp' and not fully trustworthy, worsening later isolation.
#     scene: In disputes she exaggerates others’ faults, leverages private knowledge
#       gained through midwifery, and pushes hard for her share of grain or repayment
#       in kind.
#     timing: middle adulthood (ages 35-60)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (low)
#   - consequence: Reduced functioning and increased conflict; less capacity to maintain
#       reciprocal ties, contributing to poverty, being taken advantage of, and poorer
#       resilience during illness.
#     scene: After each child’s death she cycles into weeks/months of low energy, sleeplessness,
#       tearfulness, and withdrawal from communal women’s work; later, in widowhood,
#       she neglects meals and lets stores run down.
#     timing: onset after 1021; recurrent across adulthood, strongest ages 23-77 (1021-1075)
#     trait: Depressive disorder spectrum (recurrent/persistent)
# number_of_children: '2'
# number_of_siblings: '5'
# occupation: Peasant household producer with a notable secondary role as midwife/healer
#   (occasional paid/in-kind services)
# religion: 'Mainstream Byzantine Orthodox lay practice: church attendance on Sundays/feasts
#   when possible; sign of cross; veneration of icons/relics; keeping major fasts; spoken

# - event: After she was widowed and living alone, someone from a nearby household repeatedly

#     and threads of spun wool while offering to 'help' with chores; she noticed only
#     when her winter stores ran short.
#   reasoning: Peasant households commonly faced theft of animals, grain, tools, or
#     small cash, and living alone in old age increases exposure to petty theft and
#     exploitation.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 69-72 (c. 1067-1070); recurring pattern over several seasons
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: During her marriage, her husband beat her on multiple occasions after quarrels
#     about household grain, her time spent attending births as a midwife, and accusations
#     that she was too outspoken with neighbors; the violence was mostly blows and being
#     thrown to the ground rather than weapons.
#   reasoning: Married rural women in this period had substantial exposure to partner
#     violence and coercion, and her very low agreeableness/high extraversion likely
#     increased marital conflict; widowhood suggests a long marriage duration, increasing
#     cumulative risk.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 24-33 (c. 1022-1031); recurring pattern
#   type: domestic_violence

Zoe was born on July 5, 998, in a small farming settlement on the steppe of central Anatolia, on land governed by the Byzantine emperor’s officials and taxed in grain and labor. People in her village spoke Greek and crossed themselves before icons; they called themselves Rhomaioi and took their calendar from the church.

Her parents, Manouel and Anna, had already buried a daughter. Maria had been born the year before Zoe and died before she could be weaned. Anna kept the habit of touching a small wooden cross before she lifted a baby, and she set a clay lamp before an icon of the Mother of God on evenings when the wind cut across the plain. Manouel grew barley and wheat on rented strips and kept a few goats and sheep. When he came back from the fields he checked the storage jars first, then the animals. He liked order. Zoe learned early that he disliked wasted grain and disliked backtalk more.

She was a noisy child. When older women gathered to card wool in the sun, she pushed herself into the middle and answered questions meant for her mother. Anna scolded her and then laughed with her mouth closed. At church on feast days Zoe stood close enough to see the priest’s hands as he lifted the chalice; afterward she repeated what she heard, loudly and not always accurately, to the children in the yard. That habit brought trouble. Another mother slapped her once for repeating a private argument about a boundary stone. Zoe hit back, and Manouel dragged her home by the wrist.

In 1000, Anna gave birth to a boy, Niketas. He lived only a short time. Zoe remembered the sound of her mother’s sharp breathing in the dark and the way the women spoke in short phrases. The burial was quick, and the family’s attention went back to weather and seed. Two years later Georgios was born and survived. He grew into a steady child who followed his father without questions. Zoe followed too, but to talk: she argued about when to water the garden plots and she told her father how to stack the cut stems so rats could not nest. Manouel answered with a grunt when her advice matched his.

In 1005, another baby girl, Eleni, was born and died. Anna’s body recovered, and she returned to work with the tense calm of someone counting losses. Two years later Theodoros arrived and lived long enough to run errands and throw stones at lizards near the threshing floor. Zoe fought with him and protected him in the same hour. When a neighbor’s boy tried to take Theodoros’ bread crust, Zoe grabbed the boy’s hair and pushed his face into the dust. She walked away pleased with herself and angry that anyone had assumed she would stay quiet.

The village leaned on the church for rhythm and protection. Zoe learned the order of fasting days and feast days. She carried a small clay jug to fetch holy water when the priest blessed it, and Anna sprinkled it in doorways and on the animals. Anna also attended women in labor. She kept a bundle of cloth strips, a knife kept sharp for cutting cord, and a small pouch of dried herbs. Zoe watched and then began to help: heating water, holding a woman’s shoulders, counting breaths, then washing bloody linens at the stream while her mother murmured prayers to the Mother of God and to saints women named with urgency—Paraskeue, Kyriake, Anastasia.

A run of hard seasons came when Zoe was in her mid-teens. The grain heads were thin one summer, and a harsh winter followed. The family ate more porridge and less bread. Manouel rationed the stored barley by the scoop and snapped when anyone took an extra pinch. In 1015, Theodoros fell ill with a fever and diarrhea. Anna tried everything she had—warmth, broth, herbs, holy water—while Zoe slept sitting up beside him, then walked out at dawn to vomit behind the house when the smell of sickness caught in her throat. Theodoros died that year at eight. Zoe spoke little after the burial. She still went to church, still helped her mother, but she began to sit alone behind the house in the late afternoon, staring at the ground, refusing food until Anna forced a piece of bread into her hand.

Zoe had grown into a woman men looked at twice. Her face was well-proportioned, her body strong and curved in ways the village noticed. Mothers pointed her out to sons, and Manouel used this when arranging a match. At twenty-one, in 1019, Zoe married Stephanos, a farmer from a nearby cluster of houses within the same district. The marriage brought no new land, only a rearrangement of obligations and a new roof. Zoe entered his household and immediately told his mother that the barley should be stored in smaller jars so it would not sour. The older woman stared at her, then turned away without answering. Stephanos laughed once at the sharpness of Zoe’s tongue; he stopped laughing later.

Zoe gave birth to a son in 1021 and named him Manouel after her father. The child died within days. She returned to work within days and kept attending births with Anna. She also began to snap at women during labor, ordering them to stop screaming, to breathe when she said, to obey. Some obeyed because she was effective. Some resented it and said so afterward.

In 1022, the beatings started. They followed quarrels about grain—how much to keep, how much to trade, whether Zoe had given away a scoop to a poor neighbor. Stephanos hit her with his open hand, then with fists, and once he threw her onto the packed earth so her shoulder bruised dark. He accused her of spending too many hours in other houses, of hearing too much and talking too much. Zoe shouted back. She kept shouting even when blood ran from her lip. She did not go to her father for help; she went to her mother’s house and sat on the threshold until Anna brought water and washed her face without speaking.

In 1024, Zoe gave birth to a daughter and named her Anna. The child lived two years. Zoe took pleasure in the weight of the toddler on her hip and in the sound of her small voice copying prayers. She also watched her constantly, afraid of every cough. When the girl sickened in 1026, Zoe refused to leave the child’s side even to attend another birth. Anna came to help and told her to eat; Zoe pushed the food away. After the child died, Zoe's sadness did not lift. She stopped singing while she ground grain. She stopped joining the women’s jokes while they spun thread. When she did speak, it came out hard.

Still, she continued her mother's work. By her thirties she took deliveries on her own and accepted payment in kind: a measure of flour, a wedge of cheese, a small jug of oil when someone had it. A neighbor called Eudokia sometimes assisted at births, and the two women worked together and quarreled in turns. Zoe insisted on the methods her mother had taught: the same prayers, the same herbs, the same way of tying the cord. When Eudokia tried a different poultice she had heard of from a trader's wife, Zoe refused it. She did not want new ways. She wanted the proper way, the way that had always been done. She liked sitting on a low stool in the doorway after a successful birth, washing her hands in a basin while the household’s women offered her bread crust rubbed with garlic. She enjoyed the first figs of late summer and the smell of hot bread when someone used the communal oven. She also enjoyed arguments. At markets and after liturgy she bargained loudly over wool and mocked people who, in her view, pretended not to know weights and measures. She remembered every debt owed to her and recited them when she felt slighted. In disputes she used what she knew from attending births—who had screamed for their mother, whose husband had wept, whose child had come out the wrong way—and wielded these secrets to win arguments or embarrass rivals. People called her sharp, and not kindly.

Manouel died in 1038. Zoe had to watch her mother’s face change when the household’s anchor was gone. Anna lived six more years. When she died in 1044, Zoe inherited her tools and her prayers, but not her gentler way of calming people. Georgios, her surviving brother, helped her with repairs and sometimes brought a sack of grain after a bad harvest, but he also refused to back her in public disputes. He told her once, in front of others, that she made enemies too easily. Zoe answered with a cutting remark about his fear of his wife, and he did not visit for months.

In 1049, Georgios died at forty-seven. After that Zoe's kin circle narrowed to distant cousins and neighbors whose help came with conditions. Leon, a peasant with more land than most, had lent Stephanos seed grain in a lean year; Zoe resented the debt and the way Leon spoke to her husband, and she resented more that she could say nothing about it. Stephanos remained alive, aging into a stooped man who still demanded control. Their marriage settled into a tense routine: fields, storage, church, and quarrels. Zoe's low spells returned. For days she stayed in bed late, then rose suddenly and worked with frantic intensity, scrubbing, spinning, and reciting complaints under her breath.

Stephanos died in 1066. The household goods were thin. Creditors took what they could, including animals. Zoe moved into a smaller house and lived alone. She still went to church when her legs allowed. She still crossed herself before her icon and lit a small lamp when she had oil. She sat on a low bench outside in the mornings to catch sun and watch people pass. Martha, another widow, sometimes brought soup and news. The priest Kyriakos spoke to her after liturgy and pressed a small loaf into her hands once, telling her to accept it quietly.

Theft began the next year. A young man named Petros came from a nearby household offering to carry water and chop kindling. Zoe let him in, watched him, scolded him for wasting effort, and set him tasks. Over several seasons he and others took from her stores while claiming to help. Barley disappeared from the jar in handfuls. A goatskin bag with a few coins and a bundle of spun wool vanished. Zoe noticed in winter, when the jars sounded hollow and her hands shook as she counted what remained. She shouted accusations at a doorway and gained nothing but laughter and closed faces. After that she guarded her stores with rigid care, yet she still fell into spells of lying on the mat, staring, unable to rise until hunger forced her.

In August of 1075, diarrhea struck hard and repeated. She tried to drink watered wine and then plain water, but it ran through her. Neighbors brought a cup and left quickly. On August 31, she died in her house. Women washed her body, wrapped it in cloth, and carried her to the churchyard, where the priest read prayers and she was placed in the earth with a small wooden cross set above the grave.
