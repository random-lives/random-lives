#     phase: Early childhood in natal joint household
#   - age_range: 7-16
#     key_events:
#     - Paternal grandfather dies; household authority shifts, changing work expectations
#       for women (241).
#     - Marriage negotiations begin; Gui learns 'wife skills' under grandmother—grain
#       processing, weaving, and deference scripts (ages 12-16).

#     - Household improves afterward through careful saving, a good harvest sequence,
#       and possibly acquiring/ renting additional plots (early 260s).
#     - Violent quarrel over irrigation/bund boundaries; Gui assaults her husband’s
#       sister-in-law (265, age 41).

#     narrative_role: Last infant loss; becomes part of the older women’s talk about
#       spirits, bad years, and protective rites.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Heightened dependency on literate/quick-minded relatives; contributes
#       to debt/pawning decisions and feelings of being talked over in household councils.
#     scene: Gui struggles with counting measures and remembering complex instructions
#       during tax/grain-measure interactions; she relies on a kin member to handle
#       tallies and contracts, and is vulnerable to being shorted in market exchanges.
#     timing: Most visible in early marriage and during the economic crisis (ages 17-36).
#     trait: Very low intelligence (4th percentile)
#   - consequence: Allows sustained functioning under stress and effective widow household
#       management, but can read as lack of tenderness, fueling interpersonal conflict.
#     scene: During child illness and crop shortfalls, she stays unusually calm, focuses
#       on tasks (boiling water, replanting, rationing), and does not ruminate or panic—others
#       describe her as 'hard-hearted' or 'steady as a post.'
#     timing: Throughout life, especially caregiving period (ages 45-47) and after bereavements.
#     trait: Very low neuroticism (5th percentile)
#   - consequence: Escalates quarrels with affinal kin; contributes to the assault incident
#       and lingering social friction.
#     scene: In disputes over field boundaries and irrigation turns, Gui is willing
#       to push her claim, take a little extra water time, and justify it as survival;
#       she is not easily shamed by gossip.
#     timing: Midlife strain and post-crisis competition (ages 33-42).
#     trait: Low Honesty-Humility (21st percentile)
#   - consequence: Improves access to informal support networks, but also increases
#       visibility—making her a frequent participant in disputes.
#     scene: At market-days and communal work (embankment repair, harvest exchanges),
#       Gui speaks readily, jokes, and negotiates boldly rather than staying silent,
#       building practical ties for borrowing tools/seed.
#     timing: Adolescence onward, especially early adulthood and recovery after the
#       crisis (ages 14-40).
#     trait: Higher Extraversion (66th percentile)
# number_of_children: '5'
# number_of_siblings: '5'
# occupation: 'Farm household laborer (agriculture + domestic production: food processing,
#   childcare, fuel/water, seasonal fieldwork)'

# structured_incidents:
# - event: After a run of poor harvests and a local outbreak of illness, the household
#     fell behind on grain tax and borrowed millet/rice seed from a better-off neighbor
#     lineage; to cover the debt they had to pawn cloth and temporarily lease out part
#     of their fields, tightening food supplies through the winter.
#   reasoning: Even households that end up modestly better-off often experienced at
#     least one major shock (bad harvests, illness, widowhood, exactions) in a volatile
#     period; land loss or debt crises were common risks.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 33–36
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: During an argument at the edge of the paddies over bund boundaries and irrigation
#     turns, she struck her husband’s sister-in-law with a wooden pestle/club and left
#     her bruised and bloodied, after weeks of escalating household and work-share quarrels
#     in the joint-family compound.
#   reasoning: Fights and beatings (often within household or with other women/in-laws)
#     were the most plausible form of violence she might perpetrate, especially given
#     confirmed perpetrator violence.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 41
#   type: physical_assault_perp
# - event: As a widow heading her household, she spent months nursing her chronically
#     feverish, weakened teenage son—preparing thin congee, fetching water and medicinal
#     herbs, and keeping him warm during chills—while still trying to keep the kitchen
#     garden and grain processing going.
#   reasoning: In multigenerational rural households, prolonged care for illness/disability
#     (elders, spouse, children) was common, and as a widow household head she likely
#     bore substantial responsibility.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 45–47
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: In one pregnancy she suffered a late miscarriage or stillbirth with heavy
#     bleeding and days of fever; older women in the household and a local healer helped
#     with hot compresses, herbal decoctions, and confinement while she slowly recovered
#     enough to return to field and household work.
#   reasoning: Across multiple pregnancies typical for rural married women, miscarriage/stillbirth
#     or a serious complication was common even when the mother survived.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 29
#   type: pregnancy_complications

He Gui was born in January of 224 in a hamlet of fields and mixed woodland on the middle Yangtze plain, where Han families spoke the local Sinitic tongue and paid taxes to officials who now answered to Eastern Wu. The household compound held several branches of the He lineage under one roofline: her father He Qiang, her mother, and the older generation who decided how much grain to store and how much to turn over when the registration men came.

The compound ran on routine. Before she could carry a full bucket, Gui learned the paths between well, hearth, and threshing ground. Her grandmother set out the morning bowl for the Kitchen Lord near the stove—steamed grain, a bit of broth when there was meat—and Gui was told to keep small hands away from the fire. At the new year her grandfather poured a little wine on the packed earth before the family tablets and called the ancestors by generation name, his voice flat and practiced.

Two years after Gui’s birth, her mother delivered a girl, He Lan, who died before the first month ended. There was wailing, then the women scoured the bedding and hung mugwort at the doorway. In 227 a brother arrived, He Sheng, red-faced and loud, and for a while Gui carried him on her hip while her mother worked at the mortar. Another brother, He Liang, followed in 229. When Gui was seven, her sister He Yun lived long enough to toddle and grab at Gui’s hair; the child died the next year after a short sickness that left the women boiling water and arguing over whether to call a healer. The last baby, He Xiu, came in 233 and did not last the day. Gui did not grow up expecting infants to stay.

When she was old enough to be useful, her tasks became fixed. She pulled weeds from the dry plots, watched bean pods for insects, and turned the grain in the sun so it dried evenly. She was short for a woman, and the older boys reached higher branches when they cut browse for animals, but she moved quickly and did not tire easily. She talked more than her cousins did, especially at the pond where the girls washed and traded bits of news. She liked the taste of fresh rice when the first pot was made from the new harvest, and she saved the browned crust from the bottom for herself when no one watched.

The men talked about corvée service, about boat transport for grain, about garrisons upriver. Gui listened but did not follow the numbers. She could not keep measures straight when her grandmother quizzed her—how many dou to a hu, what was left in the jar after the men carried out the tax grain. Her grandmother stopped asking and gave her tasks that did not require counting: pounding, chopping greens, bringing water, feeding scraps to the chickens.

He Zhen, her grandfather, died in 241, the same year her marriage was settled. After the mourning period, her father and uncle tightened their control of the household. Gui’s grandmother inspected the cloth Gui wove and found uneven strands. She pulled it apart and made Gui start again, then showed her how to keep tension even by anchoring the thread around her wrist.

Gui married Zhang De that year and moved a few villages away, still within the same region of waterways and flat fields. Zhang’s compound held his parents, his brother, and his brother’s wife—Zhang Sao—along with hired hands in busy seasons. Gui worked where she was placed. She husked grain at the mortar, turned compost, and walked the bunds between plots to check for breaks after rain. She carried water in shoulder poles and learned which ditches belonged to which families.

In 243 she bore her first child, a daughter, Zhang Yan. The baby lived, and Gui’s mother-in-law stopped glaring when Yan cried. Three years later came Zhang Lan, a second daughter. Gui had little interest in the naming talk or the omen talk. She focused on feeding and keeping the babies warm, and she returned to field work as soon as she could stand without dizziness. She did not read and never learned characters, but she memorized the day-counting done by others: when to soak seed, when to transplant, when to cut the early greens before insects ate them.

Market days pulled her out of the compound. She liked the noise and the smell of fried dough, and she lingered near stalls where dried fish was laid out in rows. A small Buddhist shrine stood by the road, its image darkened by smoke. On one festival day she watched a monk, Fajing, chant while a few laypeople knelt. She began to stop there with a pinch of rice or a few coins, setting them in the bowl and repeating a short phrase Fajing had taught her. She still bowed before her husband’s ancestors at home and placed food for the Kitchen Lord. She added the new practice without explaining it.

A son, Zhang Jun, was born in 252 and died almost at once. Within a season, her mother-in-law pressed for another pregnancy. In 253, at twenty-nine, Gui carried a child late and then lost it. She bled heavily, shook with chills, and lay on a straw mat while the older women boiled water and washed rags. Auntie Shen, a healer who mixed herbs with prayer, burned moxa near Gui’s belly and gave her bitter decoctions. Gui survived and sat up again within days, but she moved slowly for weeks. She resumed pounding grain with one hand braced on the mortar.

Her second daughter, Zhang Lan, lived to nine and died in 255 after a brief illness that left her weak and thirsty. The household tightened rules about water after that, and Gui began boiling drinking water in summer without being told. The same year her brother He Liang, back in her natal village, died at twenty-six. News came by a traveler who carried the message as a matter of duty. Gui’s husband drank more that night, then returned to the fields the next day.

By 257 harvests turned poor. Rain came at the wrong times, then heat, and an illness passed through nearby households. Grain stores ran down, and the tax collector still wanted his share. Gui could not track the amounts owed and accepted what her husband and his brother said about the deficit. They borrowed seed grain from a wealthier lineage and pawned cloth to cover the loan. That winter the soup was thin, and Gui rationed salt by pinching it between finger and thumb. In spring they leased out a portion of the family’s fields for a smaller share of the harvest, a humiliation that her husband’s brother blamed on Gui’s “bad births.”

After 260 conditions improved. A good harvest came, and Zhang De managed to bring in a little extra by hiring out labor on embankment repair and returning with a payment of grain. They replaced a worn hoe, bought a piglet, and stored more grain in sealed jars. Gui took pride in a full granary and in clean bundles of straw laid straight along the wall. She still made errors in measures at market and once returned with short cloth for the price she paid. Her eldest daughter Yan learned quickly and began to handle exchanges, while Gui kept to bargaining over vegetables and fuel.

In 263 Zhang De died after a fever that took him within days. The household’s men argued about division. Gui kept her place by force of will and by the labor her daughters could provide. She became the visible head of her own unit within the larger compound, managing rations and directing work. Her brother He Sheng visited once with a small sack of seed and a few lengths of rope. He spoke gently to the Zhang men and left quickly.

By 265, at forty-one, a dispute over irrigation turns exploded. Water was low, and families fought for their share at dawn. Zhang Sao accused Gui of stealing water time and shifting a bund marker. Words turned to shoving. Gui grabbed a wooden pestle used for pounding grain and struck Zhang Sao hard enough to split skin and raise bruises across her shoulder and arm. Men dragged them apart. There was shouting about calling the local functionary, Qin the grain-measurer, but the families handled it inside the compound with apologies and a gift of grain. Zhang Sao did not forgive. Support within the affinal kin group thinned.

Gui’s last son, Zhang Yong, born in 259, reached adolescence and then became chronically sick. By 269 he had recurring fevers and weakness that kept him from field work. Gui, now a widow in her mid-forties, nursed him. She cooked thin congee, brought water, and sent Yan to gather herbs along the ditch banks. She wrapped Yong in quilts when chills hit and kept a small brazier going in the corner. She still weeded the kitchen plot and pounded grain, steady and unsentimental. When Yong cried from pain, she told him to drink. When he refused, she held his jaw and made him swallow.

In the summer of 274 heavy rains fouled the ditches. Gui drank water at the edge of a field after a long day and began passing watery stool by evening. She kept working the next morning, then collapsed into squatting and vomiting, too weak to carry water. Yan boiled water and tried to feed her salted rice gruel, but Gui could not keep it down. After two days she lay on the mat, skin dry, mouth cracked, and spoke only to ask for water.

Her body was washed, wrapped, and placed in a simple grave outside the village. The family burned a little paper and set a bowl of rice and a cup of wine before the ancestor tablets, then returned to the fields.
