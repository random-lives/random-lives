#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds wide ties and influence (helps him become a respected elder),
#       but also increases exposure to conflicts (feeds into the age-29 assault incident).
#     scene: At seasonal fishing gatherings he is the one calling out greetings across
#       the water, brokering work parties, joking with visitors, and volunteering to
#       speak during disputes.
#     timing: most visible ages 15-40; resurfaces as 'storytelling elder' ages 60-75
#     trait: Extraversion (97th percentile)
#   - consequence: Raises household productivity and his authority; makes others seek
#       his judgment in boundary/compensation negotiations.
#     scene: Quickly reads weather/ice and fish behavior, proposes new net placements
#       and storage solutions, and remembers kin obligations and compensation terms—often
#       out-arguing older men until reminded to be respectful.
#     timing: ages 12-50 (pre-injury strongest)
#     trait: Intelligence (99th percentile)
#   - consequence: Improves exchange relationships and adaptability during shortages;
#       occasionally conflicts with grandmother’s strict taboos.
#     scene: Eagerly learns neighboring Baltic words and customs, tries unfamiliar preservation
#       methods and tool designs, and pushes to visit distant lakes rather than repeating
#       only his father’s routes.
#     timing: ages 10-35, then selectively in safer forms after injury
#     trait: Openness (94th percentile)
#   - consequence: Contributes to household friction during scarcity; after the head
#       injury, forgetfulness magnifies this into real risk, prompting the family to
#       restrict his tasks.
#     scene: Leaves net repairs and boat upkeep until the last moment, promising improvements
#       during winter meetings but needing reminders; relies on others’ steadiness (mother,
#       wife, later daughter Vali) to complete routine tasks.
#     timing: ages 15-60 (before and after injury, though worsened by it)
#     trait: Low Conscientiousness (27th percentile)
#   - consequence: Loss of some practical competence and independence; shift from active
#       fisher to advisory/ritual-knowledge role, increasing dependence on daughters/sons-in-law
#       while preserving respect.
#     scene: After the midlife accident he repeats the same story in one evening, misplaces
#       tools, becomes abruptly short-tempered, and sometimes walks toward the water
#       edge without clear purpose; kin redirect him gently but firmly.
#     timing: onset ages 46-48; chronic through old age
#     trait: Neurocognitive disorder from head injury (chronic behavioral/cognitive
#       change)
# number_of_children: '6'
# number_of_siblings: '4'
# occupation: Fisher in a mixed subsistence economy (river/lake fishing as primary;

# structured_incidents:
# - event: After several poor seasons when fish runs came late and thin, his household’s
#     dried fish stores spoiled and they were forced to rely heavily on foraging and
#     help from nearby kin, trading away valued gear to get through the winter.
#   reasoning: Households faced periodic bad years (failed catches, harsh winters, disease)
#     that could cause real deprivation, but strong kin support in an extended-family
#     system often buffered total destitution.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 33–35
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: During a dispute at a riverside fishing place over nets set too close to
#     his family’s weirs, he struck another adult man with a wooden pole and the fight
#     left the man badly injured, after which elders negotiated compensation in goods.
#   reasoning: The most common form of perpetrated violence for adult men would be at
#     least one serious fight/assault (disputes over resources, honor conflicts, domestic/kin
#     disputes) across decades.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 29
#   type: physical_assault_perp
# - event: He suffered a serious head injury after falling on wet timbers while hauling
#     a canoe and nets, and afterward his family noticed lasting changes—worsened memory,
#     irritability, and poorer judgment—so he was kept away from the most dangerous
#     work.
#   reasoning: He is specified to have a lasting neurocognitive disorder from head injury,
#     which typically implies an acquired disabling condition; additional sensory/mobility
#     impairments are possible but not required.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 46–48
#   type: acquired_disability
# - event: When his father became frail and intermittently confused, he took responsibility
#     for feeding him, keeping him warm, and ensuring he was not left alone near the
#     water or fire, leaning on the wider household for day-to-day tasks.
#   reasoning: Most parents died before reaching advanced old age, but his own exceptional
#     longevity implies some chance at least one parent survived into an age needing
#     support; still, it’s not the modal experience.

---

Mielo was born into a Finnic-speaking household in the forest and lake country south of the long northern rivers, where kin groups held fishing places and hunting ranges and elders settled disputes. His people left offerings at springs and groves and treated certain stones and shoreline trees as places with their own force. He also heard a Baltic tongue in the same gatherings, because marriage ties and exchange ran across the lakes.

The dwelling he first knew held more than his parents and siblings. His father Ilmo kept the nets, weirs, and boats in order and judged ice and weather by habit. His mother Kaino smoked fish, dried it on racks, and mended net mesh with steady hands. Ilmo’s mother Rauko lived with them then, and she controlled the small acts that marked a day: a pinch of meal left by the hearth before the first eating, a crumb of bread and a sliver of dried fish placed at the edge of the spring hollow before the first net-set of the season. Mielo arrived after two boys. Kauko, the firstborn, died when Mielo was still a nursing infant, and the story of it stayed close to Kaino’s mouth whenever she tightened a child’s belt against the cold.

Valo, the second son, remained. He was older by two years and had already learned to keep quiet when adults spoke. Mielo talked anyway. As soon as he could walk the packed earth outside the doorway he wandered toward voices, and Rauko snapped at him to keep away from the spring path on days when offerings were due. When Otso was born two years after Mielo, the household swelled again and Kaino’s days tightened into feeding, drying, mending, and watching. Otso died at four in the year Mielo turned six. He had been hot with sickness and then slack, and the older women washed him and carried him out before dawn. After that, Rauko forbade children to play at the water’s edge when the first autumn fog came down on the lake.

Aivo, the last child, came when Mielo was three and did not live through the day. Kaino wrapped the tiny body in cloth and laid it on a board while Ilmo and Rauko spoke low over what to do. For years after, Kaino made a point of leaving a second morsel at the spring in early summer, separate from the household offering, and she pushed it into Mielo’s hand so he would feel the weight of duty.

Mielo grew short and lean, quick on his feet and always ready to speak. By ten he carried bundles of willow withes for fish traps and learned to stitch net cords with a bone needle. Valo tried to keep him focused. Mielo kept getting distracted by whoever happened to be nearby—visitors from another lake, cousins arriving with smoked meat, a Baltic-speaking man with a bronze pin at his cloak. Mielo listened and repeated words, and when the strangers laughed at his accent he laughed with them and tried again. He took pride in getting it right. When Rauko corrected him for stepping over a laid-out net line he rolled his eyes, then fixed it, then talked himself back into her favor by telling her what he’d heard about a far lake where the fish ran thick.

Severe winters shaped their decisions. In years when the ice crusted, softened, and crusted again, Ilmo kept the family off the main crossings and made them pull the canoe over long stretches of frozen marsh instead. Mielo absorbed those judgments and began arguing about them by adolescence. He liked to test routes. Once, at sixteen, he convinced Valo to follow him along a narrow shore lead where the ice held and the trip saved half a day. Ilmo scolded him for risk, then quietly asked him exactly where the ice had been thickest and why.

At twenty-one, Mielo married Vesa from a nearby lakeshore community where Finnic and Baltic speech mixed. The match was approved after he proved he could feed a household and keep agreements. Vesa was capable and blunt. She kept track of stores and work shares in her head and reminded him when his promises got ahead of his hands. Their first daughter, Toivo, arrived the next year. Mielo held the child up for Rauko to see and then walked her to the spring in Vesa’s arms with a small cake of meal and fat for the offering. Two years later Vali was born, then Maira. After that came Niero, who lived only hours; then Sampo, who died in her first winter; then Ilma, who also died at birth. Vesa endured the losses with hard focus on tasks, and Mielo answered by talking more, filling silence with plans, arguments, and jokes that didn’t always land.

At twenty-nine, Mielo turned his mouth and his hands into trouble. Late in the spring, when fish rose and every household wanted the same narrow channel, he found nets set too close to his family’s weirs. The owner was Kirmo from a nearby settlement. Words became shoves. Mielo grabbed a wooden pole used to lift net weights and struck Kirmo across the shoulder and head. Kirmo went down and did not stand again that day. The next morning Mielo sat under the birches beside Tapio, a senior elder, while others spoke. Compensation was fixed in goods: dried fish, a good net, and a share of the next run. Mielo paid it. He complained to Vesa that Kirmo had invited the blow. Vesa answered that an injured man’s kin did not forget.

Four years later, when Mielo was thirty-four, the fish runs came late and thin. The racks filled slowly, and then a spell of damp weather turned stored fish soft and sour. Mold spread through bundles. Vesa threw away what she could not rescue. Mielo tried to laugh at it until hunger settled in. They traded away valued gear—fine net cord and a bronze needle—to kin for grain and dried meat. Kaino and Ilmo took them in for stretches of that winter, and Rauko made them bring offerings more often: small lumps of fat, a strip of fish belly, and once a bead laid under a stone at the grove edge. Mielo organized foraging parties and pushed people hard, then forgot to repair a canoe seam until water seeped through on the lake. Vesa cursed him in front of others. He took it poorly and started another argument to shift attention away from his mistake.

Toivo died at twenty when Mielo was forty. She had been strong enough to carry water and split thin firewood, and she could switch between tongues when visitors arrived. A sickness took her. Afterward, Mielo began spending more time at the spring alone, placing a small portion and sitting a while, staring at the ripples. He still joked at gatherings, but he also cut people off sharply if they mocked a widow or an orphan.

When Mielo was forty-seven he fell on wet timbers while hauling a canoe and nets up from the water. The blow to his head did not kill him, but it changed him. He forgot where he left tools, repeated the same story to the same listener, and snapped in anger at small frustrations. Once he walked toward the lake at dusk without taking a spear or firebrand, and Vesa and Vali brought him back by the elbow. Ilmo kept him away from the most dangerous work after that. Mielo still spoke in meetings, but Tapio and others watched his words more carefully and corrected him when he mixed up names or promises.

Vesa died when Mielo was sixty. By then Valo, his older brother, had already been dead for years, taken at forty-two, and Maira had died at twenty-five, leaving children behind. In the household Vali built with her husband Pekso, Mielo lived as an elder under their roof. At fifty-five, before Vesa’s death, Ilmo became frail and sometimes confused. He wandered near the fire, reached for pots with bare hands, and once stepped toward the water in winter without noticing the thin ice. Mielo took responsibility for him, feeding him, checking his clothing ties, and keeping him where eyes could find him. Ilmo died when Mielo was fifty-seven, and Mielo placed a small piece of dried fish at the spring and pressed his palm to the wet stone beside it.

His mind wandered more after the head injury, and his body limited him even when his will did not. He sat near the doorway where he could see the lake and told the same hunting story until the children corrected him with laughter. He enjoyed fresh fish liver cooked quickly over the fire and liked the first light on the water when the surface was still. He hated when nets were left tangled and would bark at Pekso’s sons, then forget why he was angry.

Chronic illness wasted him in his seventy-fifth year. In early autumn he stayed on the sleeping platform, coughing and refusing food one day, demanding it the next, angry at being washed like a child. He died under Vali’s roof.

They washed him and wrapped him in cloth, then carried him to a burial place on higher ground near their grove edge. A small portion of dried fish and a bead were left with him, and the household made a final offering at the spring before returning to the work of storing food for winter.
