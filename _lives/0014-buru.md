A woman gave birth in the cool season, in a hamlet near the low fields and tree cover south of the great river. The settlement sat under the pull of bigger villages and their headmen, and beyond them the rising chiefs who took grain and labor from whole stretches of country. The people around Nursarai spoke a Munda tongue at home. Nearby, more and more strangers spoke Indo-Aryan speech, carried by herders, priests, and men who measured land and demanded days of work.

The boy was named Buru. He entered a household with too many mouths and too little help from adult men. His father was away in the seasons when labor gangs formed, sometimes for a patron’s fields, sometimes for carting loads, sometimes for clearing new ground at the forest edge. His mother, Henda, ran the house and the work. She planted and weeded. She hauled water and fuel. She pounded grain. She carried smaller children on her hip and drove the older ones out to gather fodder.

Buru was the seventh child out of eleven births. The older girls learned the cooking fires and the grain baskets. The older boys were pulled into men’s work early. Death visited the house over and over. A newborn sister lived only hours. A small brother died in the first season of his life. Another sister died before she could speak in full sentences. No one turned those into stories. They were counted, and then the living were fed.

Buru kept away from the loud knots of boys. He watched. He listened. When a neighbor lied about a borrowed sickle, Buru named the lie and would not let it pass. He did it in front of others, not privately, and it brought blows and more enemies. Even as a child he corrected people’s counting, the number of bundles, the number of days owed. He could hold long strings of numbers in his head and repeat them back without shifting a finger on the ground.

The land around the hamlet changed during his childhood. More trees fell each year. New fields opened, first rough and then leveled. Low patches were turned into wet rice, their banks built up with mud and grass. With that came more demands. Headmen sent runners. Patrons sent men to call in labor. Buru learned the routes between hamlets and the paths along irrigation channels.

When Buru was in his early teens the rains failed. The first plantings dried and cracked. People replanted and then watched the second shoots yellow. Grain stores shrank and then emptied. Henda stretched thin porridge. Children chewed hard roots and sour fruit and complained until they were slapped quiet. Buru followed older men to a larger village where a patron kept rice in raised bins. The patron gave out measured handfuls and took promises in return. Names were spoken, and obligations attached to them. Buru remembered who promised what.

At sixteen he began slipping away during gatherings at the edge of the settlement. Festivals meant beer, drumming, and singing. They also meant young people finding places out of sight among the trees and stacked cut wood. A girl from a neighboring hamlet met him behind a shed wall and pulled him down by his wrist. Her name was Remaŋ. She held his chin hard when she spoke, as if to force his attention. They met again and again during the same season. He kept his face flat around others and did not boast. When an older cousin teased him about the way he watched Remaŋ, Buru turned and threatened him with a stick. The cousin laughed, but he stopped teasing.

Marriage came later. Buru’s household could not offer much. When he married, he did not bring a wide field or many animals. He brought his hands and his memory and a promise of steady work. His wife was Sinaŋ, from a nearby cluster of houses. She moved into his kin’s yard, into a place where women already argued over water pots and cooking space. Buru did not soften his words to make that easier. He spoke as if he were giving orders to men in a work gang. Sinaŋ learned to keep her own store of grain separate and hidden.

By his mid-twenties he traveled more for work, shifting between hamlets along the river corridor. The move was not far, but it broke old patterns. One monsoon season, crossing a swollen stream with a bundle of seed and tools tied in cloth, he stepped onto a bank that looked firm. It slid out under him. He fell hard into brown water and struck something sharp below. His leg twisted and split open. Men dragged him out and carried him on a pole between them. For weeks he lay on a mat while Sinaŋ and his sisters fed him and cleaned the wound. The cut swelled and stank. He could not put weight on it. When he finally stood again, he walked with a hitch for the rest of his life.

They had children. A son came first, then two daughters. The fourth child, another son, died as an infant. Buru did not wait out the mourning period at home. He went back to labor. Sinaŋ stopped speaking to him for days at a time, then spoke only about tasks and food.

As Buru entered his early thirties, he worked more often on a patron’s rice land. In wet season the fields were ankle-deep and crawling with leeches. Men lined up to transplant seedlings. Others carried baskets of manure. Supervisors stood on the bunds with staffs. One day the patron’s steward measured the shares after harvest and cut Buru’s portion short. Buru stepped forward and corrected the measure, reciting the count of bundles taken from each strip. He spoke loudly enough that other workers turned to listen. The steward called him insolent. Buru kept talking. The patron’s men came down from the bund. They struck him with a staff across the shoulder and back. They kicked him in the ribs when he fell into the mud. He did not beg. He spat and tried to rise, and a boot hit his mouth and loosened two teeth. He went home bent over, with mud drying in the cuts.

After that, he slept in other yards more often. He took food where he could get it and paid with labor. He and Sinaŋ stopped sharing a hearth for long stretches. He still came at certain times of year, still brought salt or a bit of iron when he had it, still claimed his place with the children when they were grown enough to answer him back. The son learned to bargain better than his father and to keep his voice down when powerful men watched. The daughters married out and moved to other hamlets.

Buru’s standing rose in a narrow way. Men asked him to tally shares, to remember who had loaned what, to settle the order of work parties. He did not smooth disputes; he ended them by stating a count and repeating it until others accepted it or walked away. Some hated him for that. Others used him because he did not forget.

In his fifties he stayed more often in a patron’s household and in temporary shelters near the fields. The rains brought sickness through the work camps every year. One late monsoon he drank from a pot set near the edge of a field where runoff gathered. Two days later he was doubled over with cramps. Water poured out of him. He tried to keep working until his legs shook and he had to squat behind a line of banana plants. The patron’s people pushed him away from the grain bins and told him not to foul the yard. He crawled to a corner of a shed where other laborers slept and lay on bare earth.

His mouth dried until his lips cracked. He asked for water and then could not keep it down. On the fourth day he could not stand. By the sixth day he was dead, in the wet season of 872 BC, in a place that was not his birth hamlet and not his wife’s hearth.
