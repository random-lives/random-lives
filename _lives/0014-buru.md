Buru was born in the wet season in a hamlet of Munda-speaking cultivators and laborers near the shallow streams that fed the Ganges plain in what is now Nalanda district. The land lay between villages that answered to headmen and patron households who claimed grain and labor, and beyond them to larger chiefs whose reach kept spreading east along the river routes. His people kept their own rites: offerings at the edge of the fields, beer poured for the dead, and nights of drumming when sickness or hunger pressed close.

His mother, Henda, ran the household with her sisters and her husband’s kin close enough to lean on. Buru’s father worked as an agro‑pastoral laborer, taking obligations and hired days wherever a patron called for hands. The household held a small patch of ground, rice in the low places when water stayed, hardy grains on higher soil, and a few animals that could be moved when grazing thinned. Buru came seventh in a long line of children. He grew up hearing the names of babies who were gone before he learned to talk. Some older siblings stayed. Many did not. His mother carried a hard, practical grief and did not give it speeches.

As a boy he avoided crowded talk. He listened from the edge while other children wrestled and shouted. When tasks were set, he finished them fast and then wandered to the same place each time: a raised bank where he could watch the field channels and see who came down the path. He learned measures and counts without being taught. He could look at a pile of cut stalks and name how many bundles it would make. He kept these sums to himself until he needed them.

The year he turned eleven, the rains failed. The shallow ponds shrank early and the seedlings yellowed. Patrons tightened their storage pits and sent men to check granaries. People ate thinner gruel. Buru’s mother mixed more wild greens into the pot and sent the older girls to collect tubers. In the evenings, men sat with silent mouths and stared at the ground. When a neighbor died, the offering beer tasted sharp and mean from the rushed brewing.

Buru grew into a lean youth with a habit of watching hands and feet more than faces. At festivals he kept to the edge until darkness made it easier to move. When he was sixteen, he began meeting a girl from a neighboring hamlet, Sinaŋ, away from the central fires. They found each other behind stacked thatch and along the path to a grove where people left offerings for spirits of place. They spoke little. They knew which elders were light sleepers and which cousins carried tales. It stayed hidden for two seasons of festivals. When Sinaŋ’s family began to speak of arranging her marriage with a man from farther down the watercourse, the meetings ended in one night. Buru did not argue with her about it. He kept away from her after that, even when others teased and tried to draw him into joking.

His first marriage came soon after, arranged through kin who needed the tie. He married Remaŋ, a woman from a cluster of houses across a stream. He moved between households and fields as obligations shifted. Remaŋ was quick in speech and kept accounts of stored grain by tying knots in fiber. Buru corrected her knots once, in front of her brother, and earned a hard look that stayed for weeks. He did not soften his words. He did not apologize.

In his mid‑twenties he carried seed and tools to a nearby village where a patron offered work on new cleared ground. Rain had swollen the stream between settlements. He tried to cross at a narrow place where the water ran fast. His foot slid from the muddy bank. He fell into the cold rush, twisted his leg, and scraped it open on hidden branches. Men hauled him out by his arms. The cut filled with grit. His ankle swelled and his knee would not take weight. For weeks he lay on a sleeping mat under the eaves while his mother and Remaŋ brought water and food. He did not speak much, but he watched everyone who came and counted how many times each person looked at his injured leg before looking at his face. A healer burned herbs in a pot and blew smoke over the wound. The swelling eased. The leg healed crooked and stiff. He returned to work with a limp that worsened after long days in waterlogged fields.

When the leg kept him from some tasks, he took others. He became the man who laid out bundles and watched the measure baskets. In the rice harvest he insisted the basket be filled level, not heaped, and he pressed the rim flat with his palm. Patrons liked that his counts matched their own. Workers resented it when the count cut their share. Buru did not give ground. He sat apart when men shared beer after the day’s work, drank slowly, and stopped before his tongue loosened.

Remaŋ bore him four children. The first was a boy, Joroŋ, who lived. Then two girls, Lita and Keraŋ, who grew into steady helpers for their mother, quick at pounding grain and carrying water. The last child came during a hard season and died soon after birth. Buru did not talk about it. He placed a small handful of rice and a few drops of beer at the edge of the yard and left without a word to anyone watching.

In his early thirties, during monsoon work on a patron’s paddy land, a dispute flared over measured shares. The patron’s steward called out numbers. Buru said the measure basket had been shaken to pack grain and then topped again. The steward called him insolent. Buru repeated the count, louder. The patron’s men came with staffs. They struck him across the shoulders and ribs and kicked him when he fell into the mud. He lay in the water and kept his arms over his head. When they finished, he stood without help, spitting muddy water. The next day he returned to the field and kept his eyes on the waterline around his ankles. After that beating he avoided that patron’s house and did day work farther away, even when the pay was worse.

The shift pulled him from Remaŋ’s kin and into other compounds. He stayed for seasons in work groups that slept under temporary shelters near the fields they were clearing. He grew less patient with his wife’s demands that he remain near home. When he returned, he found his children taller and more guarded. He spoke to them in short instructions, then sat outside the house on a low stool and listened for sounds in the dark. Sleep came in pieces. Sudden shouts, even far away, made him sit up and reach for a tool.

As he gained years, people still sought him out to settle small disputes over shares and boundary markers. He remembered where stones had been set before the last flood shifted the channel. He could repeat who had worked which days at a clearing and who owed beer for a ritual meal. He kept his own counsel, but when he spoke, it was exact. That earned him a modest standing even among men who did not like him.

He and Remaŋ stopped living together. They met at gatherings and at rites for the ancestors. They exchanged words about children and grain, then turned away. Joroŋ took up much of the heavy work at home. Lita married into a nearby hamlet. Keraŋ stayed longer, helping her mother and watching her father with a careful face.

In his fifty-second year, during the wet season, Buru lived in a patron’s household for a stretch of harvest and hauling. He drank from a shared water jar at the edge of the fields and ate rice that had been kept too long in damp air. Within a day he began passing watery stool. He tried to keep working, then stopped and crouched in the grass beyond the huts. The cramps came in waves. He could not keep down water. By the second day his mouth was dry and his hands shook when he tried to lift the cup. The patron’s people did not bring a healer; they did not want sickness inside their yard. Buru lay under a lean-to at the edge of the work camp, too weak to stand, and died there with the sounds of rain on leaves and men calling to each other in the fields.
