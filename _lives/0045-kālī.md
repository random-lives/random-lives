#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 14
#     connection: Occurs early after moving in 768; sets a fearful baseline in the marriage

#       disrespect, and shapes her strategy of appeasement and careful planning.
#     incident: domestic_violence
#   - age: 15
#     connection: During the main harvest season (late 769) she leverages her social
#       energy to coordinate women’s labor, drying, and storage; praised publicly, which

#   siblings:
#   - birth_year: 756
#     death_age: 4
#     death_year: 760
#     name: Āditya
#     narrative_role: Her only sibling; she helps mind him as a toddler and remembers
#       his warmth and noisiness. His death becomes a quiet family wound and a reference
#       point for her later anxieties about illness and fate.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds a small support network in the husband’s village (crucial
#       after violence), and enables the harvest-coordination achievement.
#     scene: At well-side and during festival days she talks easily, trades small news,
#       and recruits other women for shared tasks (gleaning, threshing help), making
#       her a social hub despite low formal status.
#     timing: later childhood through married life (ages 8-16)
#     trait: Extraversion (high)
#   - consequence: Reduces open conflict with neighbors and helps organize cooperative
#       work, but may also keep her in harmful marital dynamics longer.
#     scene: She yields in arguments, uses conciliatory language, and tries to smooth
#       tensions between households during labor exchanges and ritual obligations.
#     timing: all phases, most visible ages 12-16
#     trait: Agreeableness (high)
#   - consequence: More cautious behavior (double-checking storage, avoiding risky encounters),
#       but elevated stress and somatic complaints during hot/fever seasons.
#     scene: After her brother’s death and later after marital coercion, she becomes
#       quick to worry about fevers, omens, and social disapproval; she sleeps lightly
#       and scans for shifts in her husband’s mood.
#     timing: from age 6 onward; intensifies ages 14-16
#     trait: Neuroticism (high)
#   - consequence: Helps her fit expected norms and avoid social sanctions, but can
#       delay trying potentially helpful new treatments when illness begins.
#     scene: She prefers known routines—traditional recipes, familiar rites, and established
#       planting/processing methods—and is skeptical of unusual remedies or novel household
#       practices unless endorsed by an elder.
#     timing: childhood and early marriage (ages 7-15)
#     trait: Openness (low)
# number_of_children: '0'
# number_of_siblings: '1'
# occupation: Household agricultural and domestic labor in husband's peasant household
#   (food processing, water/fuel, childcare; seasonal fieldwork)
# religion: Household and village Hindu practice (daily/weekly offerings, lamps/incense/food,
#   festival observances; mixture of Vishnu/Shiva/Shakti with local deities; occasional
#   priest-led rites)
# sibling_ages_at_death:
# - 4
# sibling_sexes:
# - M
# structured_incidents:
# - event: In her husband’s village she became known as exceptionally capable at managing
#     peak-season harvest logistics—organizing women’s weeding/gleaning and coordinating
#     grain drying and storage so the household lost little to spoilage or pests, earning
#     public praise from elders during a post-harvest gathering.
#   reasoning: For a non-literate rural peasant girl with a very short lifespan, publicly
#     notable achievements or recognition beyond household competence were rare.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 15–16 (the harvest season before her final illness)
#   type: major_achievement
# - event: Soon after moving to her husband’s household, she was forced into sex despite
#     refusal and distress, framed as a marital right; she had no practical recourse
#     beyond seeking quiet support from an older woman neighbor.
#   reasoning: Within early marriage, sexual coercion was structurally plausible given
#     age and low autonomy; additionally, risk from other men (kin/neighbors) existed
#     but was harder to act on due to village surveillance.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 14–15 (early months after marriage relocation)
#   type: sexual_violence
# - event: Her husband periodically beat her (slaps and blows with a stick/hand) during
#     disputes over household work and perceived disobedience, leaving bruising and
#     soreness but not permanently disabling injury.
#   reasoning: Physical chastisement by husbands occurred in many patriarchal agrarian
#     societies, especially for a young bride with little leverage in a new household;
#     a nuclear household can increase partner control and reduce in-law buffering.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: recurring from age 14 to 16
#   type: domestic_violence

Kālī was born on January 26, 754, in a farming village on the Upper Gangetic Plains, where authority lay with local landholders and their agents and shifted with distant dynasties contesting the Kannauj region. Her family spoke an Indo‑Aryan village vernacular and kept household Hindu practice: a small lamp at dusk, a pinch of grain offered before meals, and calendrical fasts and festivals tied to nearby shrines.

She entered a joint household led by her grandfather, Bābā, with her grandmother Bāī directing much of the women’s work. Her father, Devarāja, ploughed with oxen and argued over shares and obligations when revenue men came for grain or for carts and labor. Her mother, Sādhvī, ground grain on the quern, kept water pots filled, and carried bundles of fodder and fuel. Kālī learned early to keep to routines. She liked sitting near the threshing floor at the end of afternoon, sorting chaff from grain with her fingertips while listening to older women trade jokes about who had spilled curd or burned flatbread.

Āditya was born in 756, and Kālī became the child who fetched small things for her mother—clean cloth, a twig to shoo flies, a cup of water—then later the one who watched him while Sādhvī worked. She bounced him on her hip, sang short refrains, and laughed when he grabbed at her hair. In 760 he fell ill after the rains; by the fourth day he was silent and hot to the touch. His death left Kālī quick to worry when the village talk turned to fever seasons and bad water.

From five onward, she moved between house and fields. She carried water from the well, gathered cow dung for fuel, and helped spread grain on mats to dry. When monsoon water sat in low ground and made footpaths slick, she avoided the flooded edges and scolded younger children for running barefoot through standing water. She paid attention to what elders approved—how to keep the storage jars sealed, how to lay neem leaves near grain, how to rinse vessels before the evening offering. At festivals she was talkative, greeting cousins and strangers alike, joining in clapping songs, and slipping away afterward to share sweets with girls her age. She liked jaggery when it was available and saved small crumbs of it to eat in private.

Bābā died in 762, and Devarāja took the lead in dealings with outsiders. When Bāī died in 767, the women’s work in Kālī’s natal home tightened into stricter schedules; Sādhvī relied on her more, and Kālī began to be spoken of as ready for marriage. That year, arrangements were finalized with a nearby village, and in 768 Kālī left her father’s courtyard for the house of her husband, Gopāla.

Gopāla lived without co-resident parents, and the household felt exposed. There were no older women between Kālī and her husband’s temper. Within the first months, he forced sex on her when she refused, saying that a wife’s refusal carried no weight. She went the next day to the well as usual, then lingered at the edge until Jayantī, an older neighbor, drew her aside and told her which women could be trusted and which ones repeated everything to men.

The beatings began the same year. Some came after he returned from fields tired and hungry; others followed small disputes—whether she had spoken too freely with neighbors, whether she had delayed a task to attend a festival day. He struck her with his hand and sometimes with a thin stick kept near the door. She learned to keep food ready at predictable times, to speak softly when he was angry, and to spend a little longer outside with other women when he was calm.

In 769 news arrived that Sādhvī had died back in Kālī’s natal village. Kālī pressed her forehead to the threshold after the messenger left and went back to work. That harvest season she found a space where her energy helped her rather than harmed her. She organized women to weed in pairs, set aside a clean area for drying, and insisted grain be turned at set intervals. She watched for damp patches and ordered them spread thinner. At a post-harvest gathering, Haradatta, who handled measures and storage norms, praised her methods in front of others, and Gopāla kept his hands off her for a time.

In April 770, at the start of the hot weather, Kālī developed a shaking fever and a heavy headache. Jayantī brought water and thin gruel, and Gopāla fetched a village healer who recited protective phrases and gave bitter decoctions. The fever did not break. On April 21, 770, Kālī died in the house she had entered as a bride.

Her body was carried to the cremation ground outside the village. Gopāla and men from his family lit the pyre, and women placed a small offering of grain and a lamp near the fire before returning to their courtyards.
