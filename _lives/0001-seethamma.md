#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6
#     key_events:
#     - Born late 1784 soon after her older brother’s death; household frames her survival
#       as uncertain and increases protective goddess offerings.
#     - Experiences recurrent disease fear (smallpox/fever seasons) and learns early
#       to be quiet/pleasing to elders to avoid reprimand.
#     - Begins helping with small chores (watching goats, fetching light water pots)
#       in a land-poor household.
#     phase: Early childhood in a joint patrilocal compound
#   - age_range: 7-17
#     key_events:
#     - Subsidiary alliance era changes tax pressure and local authority; talk of dues/arrears
#       becomes normal household conversation.
#     - Learns fieldwork skills (weeding, harvesting, winnowing) and household production;
#       no schooling beyond recognizing a few marks at most.
#     - Develops strong ritual habit around grama devata for protection, especially
#       during fever outbreaks.
#     phase: Later childhood/adolescence under tightening Hyderabad rule
#   - age_range: 18-35
#     key_events:
#     - Marriage to Kistaiah (c. 1802) within the local hamlet cluster; she continues
#       heavy farm and domestic labor.
#     - Three live births (1804, 1807, 1811) followed by deaths (1804, 1808, 1813);
#       prolonged grief and hypervigilance consolidate.
#     - Domestic tensions rise after losses and during bad years; household relies on
#       wage labor and small tenancy.
#     phase: Married adulthood and repeated child loss
#   - age_range: 36-54
#     key_events:
#     - Cholera-wave years (post-1817) and recurring drought years disrupt labor and
#       food security; debts accumulate intermittently.
#     - Night theft of stored jowar after harvest forces borrowing and worsens relations
#       with neighbors (early-mid 1830s).
#     - Severe fever season leaves lasting mobility impairment (mid-late 1830s).
#     phase: Midlife precarity, epidemics, and theft
#   - age_range: 55-66
#     key_events:
#     - Husband dies around 1841; creditors seize goats and key utensils; she becomes
#       reliant on irregular wages and kin/patron food.
#     - Lives in a small attached hut/hearth beside a kin or patron compound, taking
#       lighter work (sorting grain, childcare, leaf/fuel gathering).
#     - Dies in 1851 from an accident/violence/snakebite event (already fixed), after
#       years of pain/weakness.

#     death_year: 1784
#     narrative_role: Dies close to Seethamma’s birth; adults treat Seethamma’s infancy
#       as precarious and ‘watched’ by the village goddess, shaping her mother’s rituals
#       and anxiety.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Short-term food relief but damaged trust with neighbors/kin; contributes
#       to social isolation and harsher treatment when she becomes dependent.
#     scene: She quietly skims a handful of grain during threshing or misreports the
#       measure to a lender/landlord’s man, then acts innocent when challenged; later
#       she spreads a pointed rumor to divert blame for missing stores.
#     timing: midlife (ages 35-55), especially around the 1830s debt/theft period
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (0th percentile) — exploitative/deceitful streak
#   - consequence: Greater exposure to theft/spoilage and worsening arrears; others
#       in the compound criticize her reliability.
#     scene: She postpones repairing the grain bin or fails to keep careful track of
#       seed/loan obligations, leading to avoidable losses; she is more reactive than
#       planful in household management.
#     timing: adulthood (ages 20-60), highlighted before the jowar theft and debt crisis
#     trait: Conscientiousness (17th percentile) — low follow-through/impulsivity
#   - consequence: Reduces open conflict and preserves minimal support networks, but
#       also keeps her trapped in abusive dynamics.
#     scene: After quarrels she brings water, speaks softly, and accepts blame to stop
#       escalation; she mediates between in-laws and her husband to keep work going.
#     timing: throughout married adulthood and widowhood
#     trait: Agreeableness (80th percentile) — compliant/soothing style
#   - consequence: Improves day-to-day coping and bargaining, but cannot overcome structural
#       poverty; sometimes fuels suspicion/rumor-making.
#     scene: She picks up new weeding/seed-mixing tricks, herbal/home remedies, and
#       remembers market price patterns; she listens closely to travelers’ talk of taxes
#       and outbreaks even though she is illiterate.
#     timing: adolescence through midlife (ages 12-50)
#     trait: Openness (67th percentile) + Intelligence (62nd percentile) — quick learning
#       and curiosity within constraints
#   - consequence: Chronic insomnia and tension worsen health, strain marriage, and
#       make her more reliant on ritual specialists; contributes to social withdrawal
#       later.
#     scene: After each child death she has intrusive memories, startles at infant cries,
#       avoids certain spots (the riverbank path/cremation ground route), and performs
#       repeated protective rituals; during fever seasons she becomes sleepless and
#       irritable.
#     timing: begins in early adulthood (ages 20-30) and persists into old age, flaring
#       during epidemics and hunger years
#     trait: Trauma-/stress-related disorder (PTSD/complicated grief)
# number_of_children: '3'
# number_of_siblings: '3'
# occupation: 'Agricultural laborer (field work: weeding, sowing, harvesting) alongside
#   heavy domestic work'

# structured_incidents:
# - event: After harvest, while storing a small share of jowar in an earthen bin near
#     her hut, someone stole a sackful at night; she suspected a neighbor but could
#     not prove it and the loss forced the household to buy grain on credit.
#   reasoning: Living in poverty with insecure housing and relying on kin/patrons raises
#     exposure to petty theft, wage/produce cheating, or loss of small valuables, though
#     outright robbery was less common than small-scale pilfering.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: late 40s (c. 1832–1836)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: Following a run of poor rains, her husband’s rented plot yielded little and
#     the household fell behind on rent and seed debts; when her husband died, creditors
#     seized their few goats and cooking vessels, leaving her dependent on irregular
#     field wages and food from kin.
#   reasoning: Her adult standing worsened into precariousness/indebtedness, and widows
#     without surviving children were at high risk of debt spirals, food insecurity,
#     and loss of whatever small assets they had.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: mid-50s to early 60s (c. 1839–1846)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: As a young married woman, she was forced into sex by her husband after he
#     returned drunk on toddy, despite her resistance and illness, and she had no recourse
#     within the household.
#   reasoning: In a patriarchal rural setting with early marriage norms, coercive sex
#     within marriage and occasional assault were real risks; widowhood and dependence
#     could also expose her to exploitation, but not all violence victims experienced
#     sexual violence.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 20s (c. 1805–1810)
#   type: sexual_violence
# - event: During an argument over missing grain and her work in the fields, her husband
#     beat her with his hands and a stick in front of other household members, leaving
#     bruising and days of pain but no formal complaint was made.
#   reasoning: Given marriage followed by widowhood and later dependence on kin/patrons,
#     the most common violence channel for a rural poor woman is physical abuse by a
#     husband or other household members (in-laws/relatives) during conflicts over labor,
#     food, or accusations.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late 20s to early 30s (c. 1813–1818)
#   type: domestic_violence
# - event: After a severe fever season, she developed lasting weakness and pain in her
#     legs and hip that made carrying water and bending in the fields difficult, forcing
#     her to take lighter tasks and rely more on others for heavy work.
#   reasoning: Age-related vision loss, hearing loss, arthritis/mobility impairment,
#     or post-infection weakness were common; not all reached the threshold of 'disability,'
#     but in an older laboring woman it is a substantial possibility.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 50s (c. 1835–1838)
#   type: acquired_disability

Seethamma was born on December 1, 1784 in a Telugu-speaking village in the dry Deccan interior, under the Nizam's rule. Soldiers and tax men moved through the wider country as wars with Mysore and other powers shifted, but in her hamlet the authority that mattered was the village headman, the revenue demands that reached the fields, and the Pochamma shrine at the edge of the settlement where the goddess watched over fever and pox.

Her father, Mallesham, farmed a small rented patch when he could get it and worked for wages when he could not. The household compound held more than one hearth: grandparents, a couple of brothers, their wives, and children moving between yards and shared work. Seethamma entered a family already marked by funerals. An older sister had died five years before at two years old, another girl died the previous year at four, and her brother died that same year at six, close enough to her birth that women in the compound spoke of it in the same breath as her mother's labor pains. Her mother, Nagammani, kept a small corner shrine swept clean and fed the lamp each evening. She made offerings to Pochamma—rice, turmeric, a smear of vermilion on stone—asking that the new baby be left alone.

Seethamma grew up with the routines of a land-poor house. Before she could carry a full pot, she carried a smaller one, walking behind older women to the well and back. She learned to pat cow-dung cakes onto the wall to dry, to watch a few goats near thorn scrub, to pick up spilled grain from the threshing floor before chickens found it. She heard Telugu everywhere: in quarrels, in jokes, in prayers shouted across a yard. On fever days the adults watched for pox marks on children's faces; a neighbor's child could be covered with sores one week and dead the next. Seethamma avoided places that smelled of smoke from cremations. When she heard a baby cry hard, her stomach tightened, and she waited for someone to say the child had stopped breathing.

After 1798, new talk entered the village: the Nizam's alliance with the Company, new demands and new officials. A man who could count and keep accounts gained weight in the village, and poor cultivators lost it. Seethamma listened when men argued about rent and arrears, though she could not read the papers that traveled with the officials. She kept the measures in her head instead: a handful of seed, a basket of jowar, the number of days a debt would buy with a lender.

At seventeen she worked full days in the fields—bending for weeding, carrying bundles, beating out grain with a stick, winnowing into the wind. She liked the first hot rotis of the day, torn and dipped in thin dal, eaten squatting by the cooking place before anyone called her back to work. She also liked the cool hour before dawn when women spoke freely while walking to the well. Her closest companion then was a woman a few years older who teased her for listening too hard and remembering too much. Seethamma laughed, but she kept doing it.

She married Kistaiah at eighteen, a poor tenant and wage worker from the same cluster of hamlets. She moved only a short distance, but the household rules changed. Her mother-in-law, Buchamma, watched the stores and watched Seethamma. Work meant field labor when the rented plot was sown and wage work on others' land when it was not. Kistaiah cut fodder, joined harvest gangs, and brought home toddy on some evenings.

Two years into the marriage Seethamma gave birth to a daughter. The baby died within days. Afterward, Seethamma washed the cloths again and again and kept checking the cooking fire. She returned to the Pochamma shrine with Nagammani and the village pujari, Pochanna, and followed the instructions for offerings. At night she heard the baby's thin cry even when the yard was quiet.

One evening that same year, Kistaiah came back from toddy and forced himself on her when she was ill and resisting. He did it again on other nights, but that first time stayed fixed in her mind. She became careful with her words after that. She watched his mood and moved around it. When he was in the yard, she spoke softly and did not refuse openly.

Three years after the first birth, she bore a second daughter. The child lived through one season and then fell sick with fever and loose stool. The women tried thin rice water; Pochanna gave ash and a charm thread. The girl died. Seethamma began waking at small sounds. When another woman's infant coughed, she snapped her head around and stood up too fast. She could not bear the path past the cremation ground and took a longer route to the fields.

A son came four years later. She guarded him hard, tightening her cloth around him when strangers came close, flinching when he cried. At two, fever took him anyway. The day after the cremation, she sat at the edge of the yard and picked at grains stuck to the ground with mud, one by one, until her fingers bled. She began making repeated vows to Pochamma. If her mind drifted, she yanked it back with a prayer, then prayed again to make sure she had said it right.

Kistaiah's anger hardened after the boy's death. During an argument about missing grain and Seethamma's time in the fields, he beat her with his hands and a stick in front of the household. Bruises spread along her arm and back. Buchamma watched and said nothing. Seethamma did not complain to the headman; she kept to the work that needed doing and let the matter settle without words. In private she took small revenges. When she measured out grain, she held the measure slightly tilted. When she spoke to a lender's man, she named a smaller store than the household had. She liked getting away with it.

Cholera swept through the Deccan in waves after 1817. Travelers spoke of whole streets in towns falling sick, and the village saw sudden deaths that came too fast for rituals. Seethamma avoided gatherings when rumors of disease rose. She kept her water pot separate when she could, then used the shared well anyway because there was no other choice. She had let the grain bin crack through the dry season without patching it. She had lost count of what they owed the moneylender and had to ask Kistaiah twice, which earned her a curse.

After the harvest when she was fifty, she stored their share of jowar in an earthen bin near their hut. One night a sackful vanished. The mouth of the bin had been disturbed and the ground showed foot marks. Seethamma accused Somanna's household in sharp, indirect words, turning conversations so that others repeated her suspicion for her. Nothing came of it. The loss meant buying grain on credit, paying in labor and interest. The debt grew, and with it the interest, and with that more days of labor owed.

Two years later a severe fever season passed through. Seethamma survived it but did not regain her strength. Pain settled into her hip and ran down her leg. She could not bend for long without needing to stand and press her hand against her side. Carrying a full water pot became slow and dangerous. She switched to lighter tasks—sorting grain, watching children, stripping stalks, collecting fuel—while younger women did the heavy field work. The change cut what she could earn.

Rains failed as the 1840s began. Seed debts grew. Rent arrears piled up. Officials and intermediaries pressed harder, and the village talked of seizures and forced sales. Kistaiah died in the second year of the bad rains. Within days creditors came into the yard and took their goats and some cooking vessels. Seethamma argued, then quieted when she saw there was no one on her side. With no surviving children, she had no adult son to stand between her and the men who claimed what she owned.

By the following year she lived in a small attached hut beside a kin compound under the roofline of Chinna Kistaiah, a nephew of her husband. She cooked a little on her own hearth and ate what the household gave when she worked. She watched other people's children and dozed sitting upright, waking with a start at sudden noises. She still went to the Pochamma shrine, slower now, leaning on a stick. On festival days she found a place at the edge, offering what she could—flowers, a pinch of turmeric—and listening for the drumbeat.
