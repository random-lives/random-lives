#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6
#     key_events:
#     - Born late 1784 soon after her older brother’s death; household frames her survival
#       as uncertain and increases protective goddess offerings.
#     - Experiences recurrent disease fear (smallpox/fever seasons) and learns early
#       to be quiet/pleasing to elders to avoid reprimand.
#     - Begins helping with small chores (watching goats, fetching light water pots)
#       in a land-poor household.
#     phase: Early childhood in a joint patrilocal compound
#   - age_range: 7-17
#     key_events:
#     - Subsidiary alliance era changes tax pressure and local authority; talk of dues/arrears
#       becomes normal household conversation.
#     - Learns fieldwork skills (weeding, harvesting, winnowing) and household production;
#       no schooling beyond recognizing a few marks at most.
#     - Develops strong ritual habit around grama devata for protection, especially
#       during fever outbreaks.
#     phase: Later childhood/adolescence under tightening Hyderabad rule

#     key_events:
#     - Marriage to Kistaiah (c. 1802) within the local hamlet cluster; she continues
#       heavy farm and domestic labor.
#     - Three live births (1804, 1807, 1811) followed by deaths (1804, 1808, 1813);
#       prolonged grief and hypervigilance consolidate.
#     - Domestic tensions rise after losses and during bad years; household relies on
#       wage labor and small tenancy.
#     phase: Married adulthood and repeated child loss
#   - age_range: 36-54
#     key_events:
#     - Cholera-wave years (post-1817) and recurring drought years disrupt labor and
#       food security; debts accumulate intermittently.
#     - Night theft of stored jowar after harvest forces borrowing and worsens relations
#       with neighbors (early-mid 1830s).
#     - Severe fever season leaves lasting mobility impairment (mid-late 1830s).
#     phase: Midlife precarity, epidemics, and theft
#   - age_range: 55-66

#     death_year: 1784
#     narrative_role: Dies close to Seethamma’s birth; adults treat Seethamma’s infancy
#       as precarious and ‘watched’ by the village goddess, shaping her mother’s rituals
#       and anxiety.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Short-term food relief but damaged trust with neighbors/kin; contributes
#       to social isolation and harsher treatment when she becomes dependent.
#     scene: She quietly skims a handful of grain during threshing or misreports the
#       measure to a lender/landlord’s man, then acts innocent when challenged; later
#       she spreads a pointed rumor to divert blame for missing stores.
#     timing: midlife (ages 35-55), especially around the 1830s debt/theft period
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (0th percentile) — exploitative/deceitful streak
#   - consequence: Greater exposure to theft/spoilage and worsening arrears; others
#       in the compound criticize her reliability.
#     scene: She postpones repairing the grain bin or fails to keep careful track of
#       seed/loan obligations, leading to avoidable losses; she is more reactive than
#       planful in household management.
#     timing: adulthood (ages 20-60), highlighted before the jowar theft and debt crisis
#     trait: Conscientiousness (17th percentile) — low follow-through/impulsivity
#   - consequence: Reduces open conflict and preserves minimal support networks, but
#       also keeps her trapped in abusive dynamics.
#     scene: After quarrels she brings water, speaks softly, and accepts blame to stop
#       escalation; she mediates between in-laws and her husband to keep work going.
#     timing: throughout married adulthood and widowhood
#     trait: Agreeableness (80th percentile) — compliant/soothing style
#   - consequence: Improves day-to-day coping and bargaining, but cannot overcome structural
#       poverty; sometimes fuels suspicion/rumor-making.
#     scene: She picks up new weeding/seed-mixing tricks, herbal/home remedies, and
#       remembers market price patterns; she listens closely to travelers’ talk of taxes
#       and outbreaks even though she is illiterate.
#     timing: adolescence through midlife (ages 12-50)
#     trait: Openness (67th percentile) + Intelligence (62nd percentile) — quick learning
#       and curiosity within constraints
#   - consequence: Chronic insomnia and tension worsen health, strain marriage, and
#       make her more reliant on ritual specialists; contributes to social withdrawal
#       later.
#     scene: After each child death she has intrusive memories, startles at infant cries,
#       avoids certain spots (the riverbank path/cremation ground route), and performs
#       repeated protective rituals; during fever seasons she becomes sleepless and
#       irritable.
#     timing: begins in early adulthood (ages 20-30) and persists into old age, flaring
#       during epidemics and hunger years
#     trait: Trauma-/stress-related disorder (PTSD/complicated grief)
# number_of_children: '3'
# number_of_siblings: '3'
# occupation: 'Agricultural laborer (field work: weeding, sowing, harvesting) alongside

# structured_incidents:
# - event: After harvest, while storing a small share of jowar in an earthen bin near
#     her hut, someone stole a sackful at night; she suspected a neighbor but could
#     not prove it and the loss forced the household to buy grain on credit.
#   reasoning: Living in poverty with insecure housing and relying on kin/patrons raises
#     exposure to petty theft, wage/produce cheating, or loss of small valuables, though
#     outright robbery was less common than small-scale pilfering.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: late 40s (c. 1832–1836)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: Following a run of poor rains, her husband’s rented plot yielded little and
#     the household fell behind on rent and seed debts; when her husband died, creditors
#     seized their few goats and cooking vessels, leaving her dependent on irregular
#     field wages and food from kin.
#   reasoning: Her adult standing worsened into precariousness/indebtedness, and widows
#     without surviving children were at high risk of debt spirals, food insecurity,
#     and loss of whatever small assets they had.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: mid-50s to early 60s (c. 1839–1846)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: As a young married woman, she was forced into sex by her husband after he
#     returned drunk on toddy, despite her resistance and illness, and she had no recourse
#     within the household.
#   reasoning: In a patriarchal rural setting with early marriage norms, coercive sex
#     within marriage and occasional assault were real risks; widowhood and dependence
#     could also expose her to exploitation, but not all violence victims experienced
#     sexual violence.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 20s (c. 1805–1810)
#   type: sexual_violence
# - event: During an argument over missing grain and her work in the fields, her husband
#     beat her with his hands and a stick in front of other household members, leaving
#     bruising and days of pain but no formal complaint was made.
#   reasoning: Given marriage followed by widowhood and later dependence on kin/patrons,
#     the most common violence channel for a rural poor woman is physical abuse by a
#     husband or other household members (in-laws/relatives) during conflicts over labor,
#     food, or accusations.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late 20s to early 30s (c. 1813–1818)
#   type: domestic_violence
# - event: After a severe fever season, she developed lasting weakness and pain in her
#     legs and hip that made carrying water and bending in the fields difficult, forcing
#     her to take lighter tasks and rely more on others for heavy work.
#   reasoning: Age-related vision loss, hearing loss, arthritis/mobility impairment,
#     or post-infection weakness were common; not all reached the threshold of 'disability,'
#     but in an older laboring woman it is a substantial possibility.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 50s (c. 1835–1838)

Seethamma was born on December 1, 1784, in Remaddula, a Telugu-speaking village on the dry Deccan. The country was under the Nizam’s rule, and the village answered to local headmen and revenue men who carried orders that increasingly came through British power in Hyderabad. Seethamma’s household lived by a rented patch of land and by wage work on other people’s fields. They kept a few animals when they could and lost them when they couldn’t.

Her birth came after deaths that tightened the whole compound. Her oldest sister had died in 1779 at age two. Another sister died in 1783 at age four. Her brother, born in 1778, died in 1784 at age six, close to Seethamma’s birth. The adults spoke of those losses as they mixed turmeric and ash for protective marks and hung neem at the doorway when sickness moved through. Her mother, Nagammani, rose before light, lit a small lamp, and offered what the household could spare at the edge of the yard for the village goddess. Seethamma grew up hearing the same instruction each time a child coughed: don’t let the goddess be neglected.

When Seethamma was small, men passed through the area with weapons and animals, tied to fighting that spread across the Deccan in the years of the Mysore wars. The village did not become a battlefield, but carts were taken, grain was demanded, and there were days when her grandfather Pedda Narasaiah barred the gate and kept the children inside. Seethamma learned to sit still and listen. She watched adults measure grain, argue about shares, and try to keep some handfuls back before the dues were collected.

She did not learn to read. She learned distances and weights. She learned how long it took to fill a pot at a well when the line was long, and how quickly a basket of stalks dried on the roof. She carried small loads first, then heavier ones. She liked the early hour when the air was cooler and women spoke quietly on the path to the fields. She laughed easily at simple teasing and remembered stories travelers told at the weekly market, repeating them later with sharp details about prices and officials.

From 1798, men in the village spoke more often about Hyderabad and the British troops kept on the Nizam’s side. What it meant on the ground was pressure. The local officials wanted their revenue and wanted it on time. Seethamma’s father Mallesham talked about arrears and interest in a flat voice at night. Seethamma listened and learned which names in the village mattered and which ones could be ignored.

In 1802, at age seventeen, she married Kistaiah from the same cluster of hamlets and moved only a short walk from her father’s compound. She entered her husband’s joint household under the authority of her mother-in-law Buchamma. There were more hands, more mouths, and more rules. Seethamma did the heaviest work without complaint when eyes were on her, then cut corners when she could. She kept a small habit of saving a pinch of salt or an extra handful of millet flour in a cloth fold, not for the shrine but for herself and for later.

Her first child, a daughter, was born in 1804 and died in the same year. Seethamma handled the burial tasks without wailing in front of elders, then spent nights awake listening for sounds that were not there. She began repeating the same ritual motions at dusk—washing her hands, touching the threshold, placing a bit of cooked grain outside—until she felt the tension ease. In 1806, after Kistaiah drank toddy at a gathering and returned angry, he forced sex on her while she was still sore and sick. She did not speak of it outside the house. After that, she flinched at footsteps in the dark and slept lightly.

A second daughter was born in 1807 and died in 1808 after a sickness of fever and loose stool that spread through nearby houses. Seethamma carried the child to Pochanna, the man who served the goddess shrine and treated sickness with chants and ash. She paid him with grain and a small coin, then blamed herself when the child died anyway. She stopped walking past the cremation ground path for months. If she had to pass it, she kept her eyes on the ground and moved fast.

In 1811, she bore a son. For a time she spoke more, and she made a point of holding the boy where others could see, as if the village needed to notice she had produced a son. In 1813 he died at age two. After that, she watched other women’s children with a tense face and turned away when babies cried. She grew quick to anger when someone mentioned sickness, then just as quick to soften, offering water or food to end a quarrel.

By 1817, cholera waves reached the Deccan. People spoke of sudden vomiting and death in a day. Travel slowed and market days thinned when rumors rose. Seethamma and Kistaiah worked the rented plot when rains allowed and took wage work when they didn’t. Seethamma winnowed, threshed, weeded, and carried bundles. When drought years came, jowar heads stayed thin and prices rose. She still tried to keep some grain back from every measure. She lied about what she had seen in the bin or what she had paid at market when it suited her, and she did it with an even voice.

In 1815, when she was thirty, a quarrel broke out over missing grain and her work. Kistaiah accused her of being lazy and careless. She shouted back, then tried to retreat. He beat her with his hands and a stick in front of others in the compound. She carried bruises under her blouse for days, worked anyway, and told Pochanna she had fallen. She later soothed Kistaiah with food and quiet words, not to forgive him but to keep him predictable.

Smallpox came through the wider region more than once in her lifetime. In each fever season she watched faces and counted coughs. She kept neem leaves at the doorway and made offerings at the goddess spot even when the household had little. She disliked the smell of stale toddy and avoided the men’s circle when drinking began. She still joked with one friend, a neighbor woman who traded in firewood. They laughed at the pomp of the village accountant and at the way his son tried to copy his walk.

In 1833, after harvest, Seethamma stored a small share of jowar in an earthen bin near her hut. In the night someone stole a sackful. She went straight to Somanna’s house at dawn and stared at his doorway until his wife came out. She made accusations without naming them. She found no proof. The loss forced the household to buy grain on credit, and interest bit deep. Seethamma began guarding stores obsessively, then forgot to mend the bin’s cracked rim until after another rain spoiled a layer of grain. Buchamma scolded her, and Seethamma smiled and agreed while planning how to shift blame.

In 1836, a severe fever season hit. Seethamma survived but came out with lasting weakness and pain in her hip and legs. She could not bend for long in the fields. Carrying water became slow, then dangerous. She shifted to lighter tasks: sorting grain, watching small children in the compound, collecting fuel close by, and doing short bursts of weeding before the pain forced her upright.

Bad rains followed into the early 1840s. Rent and seed debts piled up. In 1841, Kistaiah died. Creditors came quickly. They seized the household’s goats and took cooking vessels. Seethamma watched a pot she had used for years carried out to another yard. With her earning power reduced, she moved into a small attached hut and hearth beside the compound of Chinna Kistaiah, her husband’s nephew. She worked when her legs allowed. When they didn’t, she ate what was handed to her and kept her voice sweet.

On March 19, 1851, at age sixty-six, Seethamma stepped into scrub near the edge of the settlement to gather dry fuel. A snake struck her lower leg. She shouted, fell, and was carried back. The village healer cut and bound the spot and muttered prayers at the goddess shrine. She died the same day in the attached hut beside the compound.
