#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6
#     key_events:
#     - Born late 1784 soon after her older brother’s death; household frames her survival
#       as uncertain and increases protective goddess offerings.
#     - Experiences recurrent disease fear (smallpox/fever seasons) and learns early
#       to be quiet/pleasing to elders to avoid reprimand.
#     - Begins helping with small chores (watching goats, fetching light water pots)
#       in a land-poor household.
#     phase: Early childhood in a joint patrilocal compound
#   - age_range: 7-17
#     key_events:
#     - Subsidiary alliance era changes tax pressure and local authority; talk of dues/arrears
#       becomes normal household conversation.
#     - Learns fieldwork skills (weeding, harvesting, winnowing) and household production;
#       no schooling beyond recognizing a few marks at most.
#     - Develops strong ritual habit around grama devata for protection, especially
#       during fever outbreaks.
#     phase: Later childhood/adolescence under tightening Hyderabad rule
#   - age_range: 18-35
#     key_events:
#     - Marriage to Kistaiah (c. 1802) within the local hamlet cluster; she continues
#       heavy farm and domestic labor.
#     - Three live births (1804, 1807, 1811) followed by deaths (1804, 1808, 1813);
#       prolonged grief and hypervigilance consolidate.
#     - Domestic tensions rise after losses and during bad years; household relies on
#       wage labor and small tenancy.
#     phase: Married adulthood and repeated child loss
#   - age_range: 36-54
#     key_events:
#     - Cholera-wave years (post-1817) and recurring drought years disrupt labor and
#       food security; debts accumulate intermittently.
#     - Night theft of stored jowar after harvest forces borrowing and worsens relations
#       with neighbors (early-mid 1830s).
#     - Severe fever season leaves lasting mobility impairment (mid-late 1830s).
#     phase: Midlife precarity, epidemics, and theft
#   - age_range: 55-66

#     death_year: 1784
#     narrative_role: Dies close to Seethamma’s birth; adults treat Seethamma’s infancy
#       as precarious and ‘watched’ by the village goddess, shaping her mother’s rituals
#       and anxiety.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Short-term food relief but damaged trust with neighbors/kin; contributes
#       to social isolation and harsher treatment when she becomes dependent.
#     scene: She quietly skims a handful of grain during threshing or misreports the
#       measure to a lender/landlord’s man, then acts innocent when challenged; later
#       she spreads a pointed rumor to divert blame for missing stores.
#     timing: midlife (ages 35-55), especially around the 1830s debt/theft period
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (0th percentile) — exploitative/deceitful streak
#   - consequence: Greater exposure to theft/spoilage and worsening arrears; others
#       in the compound criticize her reliability.
#     scene: She postpones repairing the grain bin or fails to keep careful track of
#       seed/loan obligations, leading to avoidable losses; she is more reactive than
#       planful in household management.
#     timing: adulthood (ages 20-60), highlighted before the jowar theft and debt crisis
#     trait: Conscientiousness (17th percentile) — low follow-through/impulsivity
#   - consequence: Reduces open conflict and preserves minimal support networks, but
#       also keeps her trapped in abusive dynamics.
#     scene: After quarrels she brings water, speaks softly, and accepts blame to stop
#       escalation; she mediates between in-laws and her husband to keep work going.
#     timing: throughout married adulthood and widowhood
#     trait: Agreeableness (80th percentile) — compliant/soothing style
#   - consequence: Improves day-to-day coping and bargaining, but cannot overcome structural
#       poverty; sometimes fuels suspicion/rumor-making.
#     scene: She picks up new weeding/seed-mixing tricks, herbal/home remedies, and
#       remembers market price patterns; she listens closely to travelers’ talk of taxes
#       and outbreaks even though she is illiterate.
#     timing: adolescence through midlife (ages 12-50)
#     trait: Openness (67th percentile) + Intelligence (62nd percentile) — quick learning
#       and curiosity within constraints
#   - consequence: Chronic insomnia and tension worsen health, strain marriage, and
#       make her more reliant on ritual specialists; contributes to social withdrawal
#       later.
#     scene: After each child death she has intrusive memories, startles at infant cries,
#       avoids certain spots (the riverbank path/cremation ground route), and performs
#       repeated protective rituals; during fever seasons she becomes sleepless and
#       irritable.
#     timing: begins in early adulthood (ages 20-30) and persists into old age, flaring
#       during epidemics and hunger years
#     trait: Trauma-/stress-related disorder (PTSD/complicated grief)
# number_of_children: '3'
# number_of_siblings: '3'
# occupation: 'Agricultural laborer (field work: weeding, sowing, harvesting) alongside

# structured_incidents:
# - event: After harvest, while storing a small share of jowar in an earthen bin near
#     her hut, someone stole a sackful at night; she suspected a neighbor but could
#     not prove it and the loss forced the household to buy grain on credit.
#   reasoning: Living in poverty with insecure housing and relying on kin/patrons raises
#     exposure to petty theft, wage/produce cheating, or loss of small valuables, though
#     outright robbery was less common than small-scale pilfering.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: late 40s (c. 1832–1836)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: Following a run of poor rains, her husband’s rented plot yielded little and
#     the household fell behind on rent and seed debts; when her husband died, creditors
#     seized their few goats and cooking vessels, leaving her dependent on irregular
#     field wages and food from kin.
#   reasoning: Her adult standing worsened into precariousness/indebtedness, and widows
#     without surviving children were at high risk of debt spirals, food insecurity,
#     and loss of whatever small assets they had.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: mid-50s to early 60s (c. 1839–1846)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: As a young married woman, she was forced into sex by her husband after he
#     returned drunk on toddy, despite her resistance and illness, and she had no recourse
#     within the household.
#   reasoning: In a patriarchal rural setting with early marriage norms, coercive sex
#     within marriage and occasional assault were real risks; widowhood and dependence
#     could also expose her to exploitation, but not all violence victims experienced
#     sexual violence.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 20s (c. 1805–1810)
#   type: sexual_violence
# - event: During an argument over missing grain and her work in the fields, her husband
#     beat her with his hands and a stick in front of other household members, leaving
#     bruising and days of pain but no formal complaint was made.
#   reasoning: Given marriage followed by widowhood and later dependence on kin/patrons,
#     the most common violence channel for a rural poor woman is physical abuse by a
#     husband or other household members (in-laws/relatives) during conflicts over labor,
#     food, or accusations.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late 20s to early 30s (c. 1813–1818)
#   type: domestic_violence
# - event: After a severe fever season, she developed lasting weakness and pain in her
#     legs and hip that made carrying water and bending in the fields difficult, forcing
#     her to take lighter tasks and rely more on others for heavy work.
#   reasoning: Age-related vision loss, hearing loss, arthritis/mobility impairment,
#     or post-infection weakness were common; not all reached the threshold of 'disability,'
#     but in an older laboring woman it is a substantial possibility.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 50s (c. 1835–1838)

Seethamma was born on December 1, 1784, in a Telugu-speaking village in the dry Deccan country that later became part of Telangana. The area lay under the Nizam’s authority and local landlords and village officers, and it felt the pull of larger wars and, later, the British military presence at Hyderabad through taxes and demands carried down into villages.

She entered a joint household compound on the edge of fields that depended on the monsoon. Her father, Mallesham, rented land and paid with grain and labor. When the harvest was poor, he worked for others. Her mother, Nagammani, cooked, carried water, tended the small kitchen patch when it held moisture, and spent long days in the fields pulling weeds and gathering the cut stalks. Seethamma was the fourth child. The first sister, born in 1777, died in 1779. The second sister, born in 1779, died in 1783. The only brother, born in 1778, died in 1784, close to Seethamma’s birth. Adults spoke of that year in low voices and kept the women indoors when strangers passed, because soldiers and camp followers moved across the wider region during the Second Anglo-Mysore War and its spillover. Men hid grain measures and kept their sickles close. In the evenings Nagammani set a lamp before the village goddess and pressed turmeric into the stone, asking for a child to stay alive.

Seethamma grew up with that fear around her. When other children cried, she stiffened and listened, then went to check on the smallest cousin in the compound. She learned early to watch for fever spots on skin, to feel foreheads, to notice when a child stopped asking for food. Smallpox came through the region more than once. People marked doors with neem, and women kept children close and argued about whose turn it was to sweep the yard and keep the ash pile tidy. Seethamma did not go to school. By seven she carried a small pot from the well, steadied by one hand on her hip. By ten she could strip jowar heads from the stalk and winnow grain with a flat basket, turning her wrists to catch the wind.

When she was a girl, her grandfather Pedda Narasaiah still sat near the threshing floor and called boys to fetch him water. Seethamma liked the hour before full sun, when the air was cooler and the goats moved slowly. She teased the other girls about who walked like an old aunt and who still ran like a child. She liked roasted groundnuts when she could get them, and she held back a pinch for herself before handing the rest to an elder. When anger flared in the yard, she used a soft voice and quick errands to cool it—bringing water, fetching a rope, moving a baby away from shouting.

Around 1798 the talk in the village changed. Men coming from the market spoke of new arrangements in Hyderabad, British troops, and new kinds of pressure on the Nizam’s country. What reached the village was simple: more demands for payment, sharper attention from intermediaries, and less patience for arrears. Mallesham argued with a revenue man at the edge of the field and came home tight-jawed. Seethamma learned which words to avoid repeating, and she learned how to say yes without promising anything.

She married in 1802, at seventeen, to Kistaiah from the same cluster of hamlets. The marriage moved her only a short walk from her natal compound, but her life changed by rules. Her mother-in-law Buchamma told her when to rise and when to eat. Seethamma carried the larger water pot now. She worked the rented plot with Kistaiah and his kin when there was seed, and when there was none she went out with other women for day wages, bending over other people’s crops.

Her first child, a daughter, came in 1804 and died the same year, within days. Seethamma washed the tiny body and sat with the women as they sang and rubbed oil into their own arms as if it could keep death away. After that she startled at infant sounds. She woke in the night to check the empty corner where the baby had slept. In the mornings she went to the goddess shrine with Nagammani and Pochanna the village pujari, bringing a small offering—flowers when she had them, a little grain when she could spare it. She began repeating the same small acts: lamp, water, turmeric, and a vow spoken under her breath.

In 1807 she bore a second daughter. The child lived into 1808 and then died after sickness that began with loose stools and a hot body. Seethamma took the child to a healer who tied thread at the wrist and muttered over a bowl of water. It did not matter. Afterward Seethamma avoided looking at other women nursing. If she heard a child coughing at night, she got up and paced the yard, unable to sit still.

Kistaiah began drinking toddy more often. In 1806, when Seethamma was twenty-two, he returned late and forced sex on her while she was ill and pushing him away. In the morning she went to the well with a swollen face and said nothing when other women asked why she walked slowly. She made jokes instead, too quick and sharp, and laughed first so no one else could set the tone.

Their son was born in 1811. Seethamma guarded him with constant attention. She refused to let him sit on the ground near the cattle shed. She argued with Buchamma about what food he could eat. In 1813 he died at two, after fever. The days after were filled with rituals and visitors and then a silence that did not lift. Seethamma began to avoid the path near the burning place. When she had to pass it, she hurried and kept her eyes on the ground. At night she woke to the sound of a child calling, then realized it was a neighbor’s son and felt anger flare, followed by shame at the anger.

In 1815, in an argument about missing grain and Seethamma’s time in the fields, Kistaiah beat her with his hands and a stick in front of Buchamma. Bruises spread across her arms and back. She slept on her side and kept working, slower for a few days, then faster to make up. She did not complain to any authority. She spoke softly again, trying to keep the household from splitting. She also began taking small things when she could: a handful of grain from the threshing pile, a little extra oil from the jar. When questioned, she denied it and acted offended, then turned it into a joke about how thin she had become. Some days it kept her fed. It also made people watch her more closely.

After 1817 cholera waves moved through the wider region, and the village lived with fear of sudden diarrhea and death. Markets quieted at times. Travelers avoided certain routes. Seethamma heard stories at the well and repeated them, adding details that served her. She remembered who owed her a favor and pressed it when she needed a day’s grain.

The 1820s and 1830s brought years of thin rains and high prices, then a year of better crops, then another shortfall. Under Hyderabad’s revenue pressures, rent and debt collection tightened. Kistaiah argued more with the landlord’s men. Seethamma learned to hide a small measure of grain in a clay pot under rags.

In late 1834, after harvest, they stored their small share of jowar in an earthen bin near Seethamma’s hut. One night a sackful disappeared. In the morning Seethamma found disturbed earth and a mark where the sack had been dragged. She accused Somanna’s household in a half-sung, half-spoken line at the well so others could hear. No one confessed. The loss forced them to buy grain on credit, and the lender set hard terms. Seethamma’s sleep worsened. Any scrape outside the hut jerked her awake.

A severe fever season struck in 1836. Seethamma survived but came out with lasting weakness and pain in her legs and hip. Carrying water became a struggle. She shifted to lighter tasks—sorting grain, watching children, collecting fuel close to the village, and doing slower weeding at the edge of fields. She hated being watched when she limped. She snapped at a girl who offered to carry her pot, then later gave the girl a pinch of roasted gram and an apology.

Poor rains continued into the late 1830s. By 1840 the household had fallen behind on rent and seed debts. In 1841 Kistaiah died. Creditors came quickly. They seized the few goats and carried off cooking vessels. Seethamma argued, then stopped, seeing the men’s faces. Without children to anchor her, she moved into a small attached hut beside her husband’s kin. Chinna Kistaiah, a nephew, allowed her to keep a separate hearth in exchange for childcare and small work. She survived on irregular wages at harvest time and on food handed to her when she had been useful or quiet.

On March 19, 1851, Seethamma went out near the field edge to gather firewood after a morning of sorting grain. A snake struck her lower leg in the scrub. She shouted and fell. People carried her back to the compound, tied a cloth above the bite, and called for a healer. She died the same day.
