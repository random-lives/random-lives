#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6
#     key_events:
#     - Born late 1784 soon after her older brother’s death; household frames her survival
#       as uncertain and increases protective goddess offerings.
#     - Experiences recurrent disease fear (smallpox/fever seasons) and learns early
#       to be quiet/pleasing to elders to avoid reprimand.
#     - Begins helping with small chores (watching goats, fetching light water pots)
#       in a land-poor household.
#     phase: Early childhood in a joint patrilocal compound
#   - age_range: 7-17
#     key_events:
#     - Subsidiary alliance era changes tax pressure and local authority; talk of dues/arrears
#       becomes normal household conversation.
#     - Learns fieldwork skills (weeding, harvesting, winnowing) and household production;
#       no schooling beyond recognizing a few marks at most.
#     - Develops strong ritual habit around grama devata for protection, especially
#       during fever outbreaks.
#     phase: Later childhood/adolescence under tightening Hyderabad rule

#     key_events:
#     - Marriage to Kistaiah (c. 1802) within the local hamlet cluster; she continues
#       heavy farm and domestic labor.
#     - Three live births (1804, 1807, 1811) followed by deaths (1804, 1808, 1813);
#       prolonged grief and hypervigilance consolidate.
#     - Domestic tensions rise after losses and during bad years; household relies on
#       wage labor and small tenancy.
#     phase: Married adulthood and repeated child loss
#   - age_range: 36-54
#     key_events:
#     - Cholera-wave years (post-1817) and recurring drought years disrupt labor and
#       food security; debts accumulate intermittently.
#     - Night theft of stored jowar after harvest forces borrowing and worsens relations
#       with neighbors (early-mid 1830s).
#     - Severe fever season leaves lasting mobility impairment (mid-late 1830s).
#     phase: Midlife precarity, epidemics, and theft

#     death_age: 6
#     death_year: 1784
#     narrative_role: Dies close to Seethamma’s birth; adults treat Seethamma’s infancy
#       as precarious and ‘watched’ by the village goddess, shaping her mother’s rituals
#       and anxiety.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Short-term food relief but damaged trust with neighbors/kin; contributes
#       to social isolation and harsher treatment when she becomes dependent.
#     scene: She quietly skims a handful of grain during threshing or misreports the
#       measure to a lender/landlord’s man, then acts innocent when challenged; later
#       she spreads a pointed rumor to divert blame for missing stores.
#     timing: midlife (ages 35-55), especially around the 1830s debt/theft period
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (0th percentile) — exploitative/deceitful streak
#   - consequence: Greater exposure to theft/spoilage and worsening arrears; others
#       in the compound criticize her reliability.
#     scene: She postpones repairing the grain bin or fails to keep careful track of
#       seed/loan obligations, leading to avoidable losses; she is more reactive than
#       planful in household management.
#     timing: adulthood (ages 20-60), highlighted before the jowar theft and debt crisis
#     trait: Conscientiousness (17th percentile) — low follow-through/impulsivity
#   - consequence: Reduces open conflict and preserves minimal support networks, but
#       also keeps her trapped in abusive dynamics.
#     scene: After quarrels she brings water, speaks softly, and accepts blame to stop
#       escalation; she mediates between in-laws and her husband to keep work going.
#     timing: throughout married adulthood and widowhood
#     trait: Agreeableness (80th percentile) — compliant/soothing style
#   - consequence: Improves day-to-day coping and bargaining, but cannot overcome structural
#       poverty; sometimes fuels suspicion/rumor-making.
#     scene: She picks up new weeding/seed-mixing tricks, herbal/home remedies, and
#       remembers market price patterns; she listens closely to travelers’ talk of taxes
#       and outbreaks even though she is illiterate.
#     timing: adolescence through midlife (ages 12-50)
#     trait: Openness (67th percentile) + Intelligence (62nd percentile) — quick learning
#       and curiosity within constraints
#   - consequence: Chronic insomnia and tension worsen health, strain marriage, and
#       make her more reliant on ritual specialists; contributes to social withdrawal
#       later.
#     scene: After each child death she has intrusive memories, startles at infant cries,
#       avoids certain spots (the riverbank path/cremation ground route), and performs
#       repeated protective rituals; during fever seasons she becomes sleepless and
#       irritable.
#     timing: begins in early adulthood (ages 20-30) and persists into old age, flaring
#       during epidemics and hunger years
#     trait: Trauma-/stress-related disorder (PTSD/complicated grief)
# number_of_children: '3'
# number_of_siblings: '3'
# occupation: 'Agricultural laborer (field work: weeding, sowing, harvesting) alongside
#   heavy domestic work'

# structured_incidents:
# - event: After harvest, while storing a small share of jowar in an earthen bin near
#     her hut, someone stole a sackful at night; she suspected a neighbor but could
#     not prove it and the loss forced the household to buy grain on credit.
#   reasoning: Living in poverty with insecure housing and relying on kin/patrons raises
#     exposure to petty theft, wage/produce cheating, or loss of small valuables, though
#     outright robbery was less common than small-scale pilfering.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: late 40s (c. 1832–1836)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: Following a run of poor rains, her husband’s rented plot yielded little and
#     the household fell behind on rent and seed debts; when her husband died, creditors
#     seized their few goats and cooking vessels, leaving her dependent on irregular
#     field wages and food from kin.
#   reasoning: Her adult standing worsened into precariousness/indebtedness, and widows
#     without surviving children were at high risk of debt spirals, food insecurity,
#     and loss of whatever small assets they had.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: mid-50s to early 60s (c. 1839–1846)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: As a young married woman, she was forced into sex by her husband after he
#     returned drunk on toddy, despite her resistance and illness, and she had no recourse
#     within the household.
#   reasoning: In a patriarchal rural setting with early marriage norms, coercive sex
#     within marriage and occasional assault were real risks; widowhood and dependence
#     could also expose her to exploitation, but not all violence victims experienced
#     sexual violence.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 20s (c. 1805–1810)
#   type: sexual_violence
# - event: During an argument over missing grain and her work in the fields, her husband
#     beat her with his hands and a stick in front of other household members, leaving
#     bruising and days of pain but no formal complaint was made.
#   reasoning: Given marriage followed by widowhood and later dependence on kin/patrons,
#     the most common violence channel for a rural poor woman is physical abuse by a
#     husband or other household members (in-laws/relatives) during conflicts over labor,
#     food, or accusations.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late 20s to early 30s (c. 1813–1818)
#   type: domestic_violence
# - event: After a severe fever season, she developed lasting weakness and pain in her
#     legs and hip that made carrying water and bending in the fields difficult, forcing
#     her to take lighter tasks and rely more on others for heavy work.
#   reasoning: Age-related vision loss, hearing loss, arthritis/mobility impairment,
#     or post-infection weakness were common; not all reached the threshold of 'disability,'
#     but in an older laboring woman it is a substantial possibility.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 50s (c. 1835–1838)
#   type: acquired_disability

Seethamma was born on December 1, 1784, in a Telugu-speaking village in the dry Deccan country, under the Nizam’s authority and the local men who collected revenue and settled disputes. The village spoke Telugu, kept small shrines in courtyards, and watched the wider world through tax demands, troop movements, and the price of grain.

Her household sat in a joint compound with her father Mallesham under the eye of Pedda Narasaiah, the old man who decided which patch of rented ground they would try to work each season. Seethamma entered a family already thinned by sickness. Her oldest sister had died in 1779 at two years old. Another sister followed in 1783 at four. Her older brother, born in 1778, lasted to the middle of 1784 and then died at six, a few weeks before Seethamma arrived. The women in the compound spoke of his breathing and the heat of his skin whenever they saw a child with fever.

As a baby she was carried to the grama devata shrine at the edge of the settlement. Nagammani, her mother, tied neem leaves by the doorway and kept a small lamp near the cooking place. Seethamma grew up with those routines: smearing turmeric at the threshold, touching the ground before leaving at dawn, and placing a pinch of grain before the goddess when the sky held back rain.

When she was small, men with weapons and pack animals passed on the road during the spillover of war in the Deccan. A few times the village headman sent boys to watch the path and warn the settlement. Seethamma’s earliest memories held the sounds more than the reasons: hoofbeats, shouted orders, and then weeks when her father came home later and spoke in short sentences.

At seven she began field work in earnest. She learned how to pull weeds without breaking the young stalks, how to spread dung without wasting it, and how to carry water in smaller pots so her arms did not shake. She liked the early hours when the air still cooled the skin and the birds fussed in the thorny scrub. When women rested under a neem tree at midday, she listened. She remembered details and repeated them later with a sharpness that made the older women laugh. She also cut corners. If a task bored her, she left it half done and walked away, letting someone else discover it.

From 1798, talk of new arrangements with the British entered even the village lanes. Men argued over what the Nizam’s officials demanded now, and whether the village accountant’s figures could be trusted. Mallesham’s temper rose when the tax man came. Seethamma watched him swallow anger in front of elders and then take it out on the goats, kicking at them to make them move.

Smallpox ran through the region more than once during her childhood. In one season, several children in the hamlet carried scars afterward. Nagammani did not let Seethamma drink from certain pots or sit close to strangers. Seethamma learned to flinch at coughs and to stare hard at any rash on a child’s skin. Those habits stayed.

In 1802, at seventeen, she married Kistaiah, a tenant and sharecropper from the same cluster of hamlets. He worked a rented strip of land when he could secure it and took wage labor when the rent and seed money ran ahead of the harvest. Seethamma moved to his family’s side of the settlement, close enough that she still heard her natal compound at night when dogs barked. Her mother-in-law Buchamma set rules about grinding, water, and where Seethamma could rest. Seethamma soothed her with soft speech and quick obedience in public. When Buchamma turned away, Seethamma took small advantages, setting aside the better lentils for her own pot or claiming she had already finished a task when she had not.

Her first child, a daughter, came in 1804. The baby lived only days. The women washed cloths and spoke of the mother’s milk and the infant’s thin cry. Seethamma did not sleep afterward. She woke at small sounds and reached out for a child that was not there. She began to avoid the spot near the doorway where the baby had been laid, stepping around it without thinking.

In 1807 she gave birth to a second daughter. That child survived long enough to sit in a lap and grab at hair. In 1808, after a bout of fever and loose stools, the girl died. Seethamma walked to the shrine with offerings until her feet burned. She pressed her forehead to the stone and repeated the same requests again and again. When other women spoke of remedies, she collected them quickly, combining them in ways that made no sense to older hands, then defending herself when corrected.

A son arrived in 1811. Kistaiah’s mood lifted for a time. He spoke more, drank less for a few months, and carried the boy on his hip when he returned from the fields. Seethamma watched the child’s breathing at night. She woke at every change in sound. In 1813, when the boy turned two, he caught fever and did not recover. Kistaiah shouted at the healer and accused Buchamma of neglect. Seethamma sat with her back against the wall and shook. Afterward she stopped going near the cremation path for weeks, sending other women to fetch water from that direction.

In 1806, after a day of hard work and while she still carried the soreness of childbirth and grief, Kistaiah returned from drinking toddy and forced sex on her while she resisted and cried. She went to the riverbank before dawn the next day and washed until her skin stung. She did not tell anyone. In the compound she spoke gently, cooked, and worked the fields, then woke in the night with a start, her heart hammering at imagined footsteps.

Cholera waves reached the Deccan after 1817. Travelers avoided some roads, and the village heard of sudden deaths along the route to larger towns. Seethamma refused certain water sources during those years and scolded younger women for carelessness. When drought years came, the scolding turned into anger. She watched grain disappear into mouths and debts. She also learned the small tricks of survival: taking a little extra chaff to feed a neighbor’s animal in exchange for buttermilk, or claiming fewer measures than she had carried so someone else would take the blame for shortage.

In 1815, after an argument over missing grain and Seethamma’s field work, Kistaiah beat her with his hands and a stick. Buchamma watched, arms folded, and did not intervene. Bruises spread across Seethamma’s shoulder and back. She lay on her side for two days, then stood and returned to the field with slow movements. She spoke to Kistaiah with careful calm after that, watching his mouth and his hands when he drank.

By 1834, with her late forties gone, the household’s margin had thinned. After harvest she stored their small share of jowar in an earthen bin near her hut. One night a sackful disappeared. She found the disturbed lid at dawn. She suspected Somanna, a neighbor who had asked about their stores the previous week, but she had no witness. Kistaiah argued with Somanna at the edge of the lane, then backed down when Somanna’s cousins arrived. Seethamma bought grain on credit, putting her thumbprint on a mark she could not read, and the lender’s clerk smiled as he counted out measures.

In 1836 a severe fever season swept the village. Seethamma recovered, but afterward her legs and hip stayed weak and painful. Carrying water became an ordeal. She shifted to lighter tasks: sorting grain, watching children in the compound, stripping stalks, and gathering fuel in shorter trips. When she tried to bend for long weeding lines, pain forced her upright. She hid it at first, then began to ask for help, which came with complaints.

Bad rains followed in 1839 and 1840. Rent and seed debts piled up. The Nizam’s revenue pressure and local intermediaries’ demands tightened, and the landlord’s man grew blunt about arrears. Kistaiah left for wage work more often and returned with less. In 1841 he died after a short illness. Within days the creditor came with men and took their few goats and cooking vessels. Seethamma stood in the doorway and argued, voice steady, then tried a different approach, offering to work off part of the debt. The men laughed and carried the pots away.
