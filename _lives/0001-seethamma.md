#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6
#     key_events:
#     - Born late 1784 soon after her older brother’s death; household frames her survival
#       as uncertain and increases protective goddess offerings.
#     - Experiences recurrent disease fear (smallpox/fever seasons) and learns early
#       to be quiet/pleasing to elders to avoid reprimand.
#     - Begins helping with small chores (watching goats, fetching light water pots)
#       in a land-poor household.
#     phase: Early childhood in a joint patrilocal compound
#   - age_range: 7-17
#     key_events:
#     - Subsidiary alliance era changes tax pressure and local authority; talk of dues/arrears
#       becomes normal household conversation.
#     - Learns fieldwork skills (weeding, harvesting, winnowing) and household production;
#       no schooling beyond recognizing a few marks at most.
#     - Develops strong ritual habit around grama devata for protection, especially
#       during fever outbreaks.
#     phase: Later childhood/adolescence under tightening Hyderabad rule
#   - age_range: 18-35
#     key_events:
#     - Marriage to Kistaiah (c. 1802) within the local hamlet cluster; she continues
#       heavy farm and domestic labor.
#     - Three live births (1804, 1807, 1811) followed by deaths (1804, 1808, 1813);
#       prolonged grief and hypervigilance consolidate.
#     - Domestic tensions rise after losses and during bad years; household relies on
#       wage labor and small tenancy.
#     phase: Married adulthood and repeated child loss
#   - age_range: 36-54
#     key_events:
#     - Cholera-wave years (post-1817) and recurring drought years disrupt labor and
#       food security; debts accumulate intermittently.
#     - Night theft of stored jowar after harvest forces borrowing and worsens relations
#       with neighbors (early-mid 1830s).
#     - Severe fever season leaves lasting mobility impairment (mid-late 1830s).
#     phase: Midlife precarity, epidemics, and theft
#   - age_range: 55-66
#     key_events:
#     - Husband dies around 1841; creditors seize goats and key utensils; she becomes
#       reliant on irregular wages and kin/patron food.
#     - Lives in a small attached hut/hearth beside a kin or patron compound, taking
#       lighter work (sorting grain, childcare, leaf/fuel gathering).
#     - Dies in 1851 from an accident/violence/snakebite event (already fixed), after
#       years of pain/weakness.

#     death_age: 4
#     death_year: 1783

#     death_age: 6
#     death_year: 1784
#     narrative_role: Dies close to Seethamma’s birth; adults treat Seethamma’s infancy
#       as precarious and ‘watched’ by the village goddess, shaping her mother’s rituals
#       and anxiety.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Short-term food relief but damaged trust with neighbors/kin; contributes
#       to social isolation and harsher treatment when she becomes dependent.
#     scene: She quietly skims a handful of grain during threshing or misreports the
#       measure to a lender/landlord’s man, then acts innocent when challenged; later
#       she spreads a pointed rumor to divert blame for missing stores.
#     timing: midlife (ages 35-55), especially around the 1830s debt/theft period
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (0th percentile) — exploitative/deceitful streak
#   - consequence: Greater exposure to theft/spoilage and worsening arrears; others
#       in the compound criticize her reliability.
#     scene: She postpones repairing the grain bin or fails to keep careful track of
#       seed/loan obligations, leading to avoidable losses; she is more reactive than
#       planful in household management.
#     timing: adulthood (ages 20-60), highlighted before the jowar theft and debt crisis
#     trait: Conscientiousness (17th percentile) — low follow-through/impulsivity
#   - consequence: Reduces open conflict and preserves minimal support networks, but
#       also keeps her trapped in abusive dynamics.
#     scene: After quarrels she brings water, speaks softly, and accepts blame to stop
#       escalation; she mediates between in-laws and her husband to keep work going.
#     timing: throughout married adulthood and widowhood
#     trait: Agreeableness (80th percentile) — compliant/soothing style
#   - consequence: Improves day-to-day coping and bargaining, but cannot overcome structural
#       poverty; sometimes fuels suspicion/rumor-making.
#     scene: She picks up new weeding/seed-mixing tricks, herbal/home remedies, and
#       remembers market price patterns; she listens closely to travelers’ talk of taxes
#       and outbreaks even though she is illiterate.
#     timing: adolescence through midlife (ages 12-50)
#     trait: Openness (67th percentile) + Intelligence (62nd percentile) — quick learning
#       and curiosity within constraints
#   - consequence: Chronic insomnia and tension worsen health, strain marriage, and
#       make her more reliant on ritual specialists; contributes to social withdrawal
#       later.
#     scene: After each child death she has intrusive memories, startles at infant cries,
#       avoids certain spots (the riverbank path/cremation ground route), and performs
#       repeated protective rituals; during fever seasons she becomes sleepless and
#       irritable.
#     timing: begins in early adulthood (ages 20-30) and persists into old age, flaring
#       during epidemics and hunger years
#     trait: Trauma-/stress-related disorder (PTSD/complicated grief)
# number_of_children: '3'
# number_of_siblings: '3'
# occupation: 'Agricultural laborer (field work: weeding, sowing, harvesting) alongside
#   heavy domestic work'

# structured_incidents:
# - event: After harvest, while storing a small share of jowar in an earthen bin near
#     her hut, someone stole a sackful at night; she suspected a neighbor but could
#     not prove it and the loss forced the household to buy grain on credit.
#   reasoning: Living in poverty with insecure housing and relying on kin/patrons raises
#     exposure to petty theft, wage/produce cheating, or loss of small valuables, though
#     outright robbery was less common than small-scale pilfering.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: late 40s (c. 1832–1836)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: Following a run of poor rains, her husband’s rented plot yielded little and
#     the household fell behind on rent and seed debts; when her husband died, creditors
#     seized their few goats and cooking vessels, leaving her dependent on irregular
#     field wages and food from kin.
#   reasoning: Her adult standing worsened into precariousness/indebtedness, and widows
#     without surviving children were at high risk of debt spirals, food insecurity,
#     and loss of whatever small assets they had.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: mid-50s to early 60s (c. 1839–1846)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: As a young married woman, she was forced into sex by her husband after he
#     returned drunk on toddy, despite her resistance and illness, and she had no recourse
#     within the household.
#   reasoning: In a patriarchal rural setting with early marriage norms, coercive sex
#     within marriage and occasional assault were real risks; widowhood and dependence
#     could also expose her to exploitation, but not all violence victims experienced
#     sexual violence.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 20s (c. 1805–1810)
#   type: sexual_violence
# - event: During an argument over missing grain and her work in the fields, her husband
#     beat her with his hands and a stick in front of other household members, leaving
#     bruising and days of pain but no formal complaint was made.
#   reasoning: Given marriage followed by widowhood and later dependence on kin/patrons,
#     the most common violence channel for a rural poor woman is physical abuse by a
#     husband or other household members (in-laws/relatives) during conflicts over labor,
#     food, or accusations.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late 20s to early 30s (c. 1813–1818)
#   type: domestic_violence
# - event: After a severe fever season, she developed lasting weakness and pain in her
#     legs and hip that made carrying water and bending in the fields difficult, forcing
#     her to take lighter tasks and rely more on others for heavy work.
#   reasoning: Age-related vision loss, hearing loss, arthritis/mobility impairment,
#     or post-infection weakness were common; not all reached the threshold of 'disability,'
#     but in an older laboring woman it is a substantial possibility.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 50s (c. 1835–1838)
#   type: acquired_disability

Seethamma was born on 1 December 1784 in Remaddula, in the dry Deccan country where Telugu was spoken in the lanes and fields. The village sat under the Nizam’s authority, with local officials and headmen handling taxes and disputes, and with bigger forces—Mysore’s wars and then British power—pressing on the region through troop movements, revenue demands, and changing rules.

Her father, Mallesham, worked a small rented patch when he could and filled the gaps with wage labor on others’ fields. Her mother, Nagammani, carried water, gathered fuel, cooked for a joint household, and bent over the fields for weeding and harvest. Seethamma entered a family already thinned. An older sister born in 1777 had died at two, another sister born in 1779 had died at four, and her brother born in 1778 died in 1784, close to Seethamma’s own birth. In the compound, adults spoke of “bad years” and “bad air” more than of the dead themselves. Nagammani made offerings to the grama devata with extra care. A lamp at dusk, turmeric on a stone, a coconut when they could afford one. Seethamma grew up watching hands move through these routines.

When Seethamma was a toddler, travelers and stray soldiers passed through the wider countryside during the Second Anglo-Mysore War’s spillover. Men in the village complained about requisitions and about the way markets became thin when caravans avoided certain routes. She learned early to stay close to the compound when strangers appeared and to obey quick commands without questions.

She never went to school. By the time she could carry a small pot, she was sent for water with other girls, taught to balance, taught to wait. She learned to weed in lines, to cut fodder, to watch a pot from boiling over, and to keep ash dry for scrubbing. She liked sitting at the edge of the threshing ground at dusk when the day cooled, picking at roasted gram someone passed along. She laughed easily at quick teasing from other girls and learned how to answer back without starting a fight.

As she grew, fear sat close under daily talk. Smallpox came through the region in waves. When a child broke out in pustules, women kept distance and then worked fast—washing cloths, boiling water, smearing cool paste. Seethamma watched older women measure risk by smell, by heat on the skin, by a child’s cry. She also watched how quickly a household could slide when labor was lost.

When she was about fourteen, word spread that British influence had tightened over Hyderabad through the subsidiary arrangement. People in the village did not discuss treaties, but they felt the results. More insistence from officials. More talk of arrears. More pressure on those with weak claims on land. Mallesham’s worry showed in short tempers and in how often he left before sunrise to seek day work.

Seethamma married in 1802, at seventeen, to Kistaiah from the same cluster of hamlets. She did not leave her world; she shifted a short distance and began answering to a new set of elders. Her mother-in-law, Buchamma, kept the keys to whatever grain was stored and watched Seethamma’s hands for waste. Kistaiah rented a small plot and joined other men for wage work when the rains were poor. Seethamma moved between field and hearth. She carried bundles of stalks, spread dung cakes to dry, helped pound grain, and cut weeds until her fingers went raw.

Her first child, a daughter, was born in 1804 and died the same year, in the first days. Seethamma wrapped the tiny body in cloth while others spoke prayers. After that, she stopped sleeping deeply. She woke at small noises and sat up to check the doorway, the fire, the pot of water. When she saw other women’s infants, she stared too long, as if counting breaths. She avoided the edge of the cremation ground path and took longer routes without explaining why.

In 1807 she bore another daughter. The child lived into 1808 and then died after sickness with loose stools and fever. Seethamma went to the shrine of the village goddess with Nagammani and a local pujari, Pochanna. They offered what they could: neem leaves, a bit of jaggery, a promise. Seethamma followed every instruction for days, even when Buchamma mocked the expense. At home she tried remedies she had learned from other women, some sensible, some not. She was quick to pick up a new mixture, quick to repeat it as if repetition itself could force a result.

In the years after that loss, Kistaiah began drinking more toddy. One evening between 1805 and 1810, when Seethamma was in her early twenties and already feeling ill, he returned drunk and forced sex on her while she resisted. No one intervened. In the morning she moved carefully, kept her face blank, and went to the fields as if nothing had happened. Later, when other women joked about men and drink, she laughed with them, too loud, and then fell silent.

In 1811 she gave birth to a son. For two years she watched him with a vigilance that pulled her thin. She flinched when he coughed. She checked his skin for heat and woke him for water. She did not let other children hold him. In 1813, he died at two. After that, Seethamma stopped joining certain gatherings. She still went to the goddess shrine, but she went alone more often, at odd times, with a lamp cupped in her hand.

By the mid-1810s, drought years came and went, and each poor monsoon meant higher grain prices and harsher terms for tenants. In 1817 and after, cholera waves reached through the Deccan, closing routes and emptying some houses. Seethamma learned to watch who fell sick on the road and who returned from markets with stories of deaths in other villages.

Between 1813 and 1818, in her late twenties to early thirties, a fight broke out in the compound over missing grain and her work in the fields. Kistaiah accused her. Buchamma backed him. Kistaiah beat her with hands and a stick in front of others. She took it without screaming, then hid in the corner of the yard to wash and cover bruises. After that, she spoke more softly when money or grain was mentioned. She also began to keep small amounts aside when she could—pinches of grain during threshing, a little oil, bits of jaggery—items she could trade later without asking.

In the early 1830s, when Seethamma was in her late forties, the household kept a small share of jowar in an earthen bin near her hut after harvest. One night a sackful disappeared. In the morning she found disturbed earth and a loosened lid. She blamed Somanna, a neighbor with a sharp tongue, but she had no proof. The loss forced them to buy grain on credit. The lender measured with a heavy hand and wrote nothing down that Seethamma could read. She argued anyway, counting measures by eye and memory. That week she stopped sharing roasted snacks with Somanna’s wife at the well.

In the mid-to-late 1830s, a bad fever season struck. Seethamma survived, but afterward her legs and hip hurt and weakened. She could not bend long for weeding. Carrying full water pots became dangerous. She shifted to lighter tasks: sorting grain, collecting smaller bundles of fuel, minding a child for a neighbor in exchange for a meal. She resented needing help and sometimes pretended she could do more than she could, then paid for it with days of pain.

From 1839 into the mid-1840s, rains failed in runs. Rent and seed debts piled up. Officials and intermediaries pressed harder in these years, and the village’s poor paid first. In 1841, when Seethamma was fifty-six, Kistaiah died. Creditors arrived quickly. They seized the few goats and key cooking vessels. Seethamma argued and tried to hide a pot, then watched it taken anyway. Without an adult child to claim space for her, she moved into a small attached unit beside a kin or patron compound, under the eye of her husband’s nephew, Chinna Kistaiah. She earned what she could with irregular work and accepted food when it was offered. She kept going to the goddess shrine, sometimes with a little lamp, sometimes with nothing but a muttered request.
