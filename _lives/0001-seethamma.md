#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6
#     key_events:
#     - Born late 1784 soon after her older brother’s death; household frames her survival
#       as uncertain and increases protective goddess offerings.
#     - Experiences recurrent disease fear (smallpox/fever seasons) and learns early
#       to be quiet/pleasing to elders to avoid reprimand.
#     - Begins helping with small chores (watching goats, fetching light water pots)
#       in a land-poor household.
#     phase: Early childhood in a joint patrilocal compound
#   - age_range: 7-17
#     key_events:
#     - Subsidiary alliance era changes tax pressure and local authority; talk of dues/arrears
#       becomes normal household conversation.
#     - Learns fieldwork skills (weeding, harvesting, winnowing) and household production;
#       no schooling beyond recognizing a few marks at most.
#     - Develops strong ritual habit around grama devata for protection, especially
#       during fever outbreaks.
#     phase: Later childhood/adolescence under tightening Hyderabad rule
#   - age_range: 18-35
#     key_events:
#     - Marriage to Kistaiah (c. 1802) within the local hamlet cluster; she continues
#       heavy farm and domestic labor.
#     - Three live births (1804, 1807, 1811) followed by deaths (1804, 1808, 1813);
#       prolonged grief and hypervigilance consolidate.
#     - Domestic tensions rise after losses and during bad years; household relies on
#       wage labor and small tenancy.
#     phase: Married adulthood and repeated child loss
#   - age_range: 36-54
#     key_events:
#     - Cholera-wave years (post-1817) and recurring drought years disrupt labor and
#       food security; debts accumulate intermittently.
#     - Night theft of stored jowar after harvest forces borrowing and worsens relations
#       with neighbors (early-mid 1830s).
#     - Severe fever season leaves lasting mobility impairment (mid-late 1830s).
#     phase: Midlife precarity, epidemics, and theft
#   - age_range: 55-66
#     key_events:
#     - Husband dies around 1841; creditors seize goats and key utensils; she becomes
#       reliant on irregular wages and kin/patron food.
#     - Lives in a small attached hut/hearth beside a kin or patron compound, taking
#       lighter work (sorting grain, childcare, leaf/fuel gathering).
#     - Dies in 1851 from an accident/violence/snakebite event (already fixed), after
#       years of pain/weakness.

#     death_age: 4
#     death_year: 1783

#     death_year: 1784
#     narrative_role: Dies close to Seethamma’s birth; adults treat Seethamma’s infancy
#       as precarious and ‘watched’ by the village goddess, shaping her mother’s rituals
#       and anxiety.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Short-term food relief but damaged trust with neighbors/kin; contributes
#       to social isolation and harsher treatment when she becomes dependent.
#     scene: She quietly skims a handful of grain during threshing or misreports the
#       measure to a lender/landlord’s man, then acts innocent when challenged; later
#       she spreads a pointed rumor to divert blame for missing stores.
#     timing: midlife (ages 35-55), especially around the 1830s debt/theft period
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (0th percentile) — exploitative/deceitful streak
#   - consequence: Greater exposure to theft/spoilage and worsening arrears; others
#       in the compound criticize her reliability.
#     scene: She postpones repairing the grain bin or fails to keep careful track of
#       seed/loan obligations, leading to avoidable losses; she is more reactive than
#       planful in household management.
#     timing: adulthood (ages 20-60), highlighted before the jowar theft and debt crisis
#     trait: Conscientiousness (17th percentile) — low follow-through/impulsivity
#   - consequence: Reduces open conflict and preserves minimal support networks, but
#       also keeps her trapped in abusive dynamics.
#     scene: After quarrels she brings water, speaks softly, and accepts blame to stop
#       escalation; she mediates between in-laws and her husband to keep work going.
#     timing: throughout married adulthood and widowhood
#     trait: Agreeableness (80th percentile) — compliant/soothing style
#   - consequence: Improves day-to-day coping and bargaining, but cannot overcome structural
#       poverty; sometimes fuels suspicion/rumor-making.
#     scene: She picks up new weeding/seed-mixing tricks, herbal/home remedies, and
#       remembers market price patterns; she listens closely to travelers’ talk of taxes
#       and outbreaks even though she is illiterate.
#     timing: adolescence through midlife (ages 12-50)
#     trait: Openness (67th percentile) + Intelligence (62nd percentile) — quick learning
#       and curiosity within constraints
#   - consequence: Chronic insomnia and tension worsen health, strain marriage, and
#       make her more reliant on ritual specialists; contributes to social withdrawal
#       later.
#     scene: After each child death she has intrusive memories, startles at infant cries,
#       avoids certain spots (the riverbank path/cremation ground route), and performs
#       repeated protective rituals; during fever seasons she becomes sleepless and
#       irritable.
#     timing: begins in early adulthood (ages 20-30) and persists into old age, flaring
#       during epidemics and hunger years
#     trait: Trauma-/stress-related disorder (PTSD/complicated grief)
# number_of_children: '3'
# number_of_siblings: '3'
# occupation: 'Agricultural laborer (field work: weeding, sowing, harvesting) alongside
#   heavy domestic work'

# structured_incidents:
# - event: After harvest, while storing a small share of jowar in an earthen bin near
#     her hut, someone stole a sackful at night; she suspected a neighbor but could
#     not prove it and the loss forced the household to buy grain on credit.
#   reasoning: Living in poverty with insecure housing and relying on kin/patrons raises
#     exposure to petty theft, wage/produce cheating, or loss of small valuables, though
#     outright robbery was less common than small-scale pilfering.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: late 40s (c. 1832–1836)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: Following a run of poor rains, her husband’s rented plot yielded little and
#     the household fell behind on rent and seed debts; when her husband died, creditors
#     seized their few goats and cooking vessels, leaving her dependent on irregular
#     field wages and food from kin.
#   reasoning: Her adult standing worsened into precariousness/indebtedness, and widows
#     without surviving children were at high risk of debt spirals, food insecurity,
#     and loss of whatever small assets they had.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: mid-50s to early 60s (c. 1839–1846)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: As a young married woman, she was forced into sex by her husband after he
#     returned drunk on toddy, despite her resistance and illness, and she had no recourse
#     within the household.
#   reasoning: In a patriarchal rural setting with early marriage norms, coercive sex
#     within marriage and occasional assault were real risks; widowhood and dependence
#     could also expose her to exploitation, but not all violence victims experienced
#     sexual violence.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 20s (c. 1805–1810)
#   type: sexual_violence
# - event: During an argument over missing grain and her work in the fields, her husband
#     beat her with his hands and a stick in front of other household members, leaving
#     bruising and days of pain but no formal complaint was made.
#   reasoning: Given marriage followed by widowhood and later dependence on kin/patrons,
#     the most common violence channel for a rural poor woman is physical abuse by a
#     husband or other household members (in-laws/relatives) during conflicts over labor,
#     food, or accusations.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late 20s to early 30s (c. 1813–1818)
#   type: domestic_violence
# - event: After a severe fever season, she developed lasting weakness and pain in her
#     legs and hip that made carrying water and bending in the fields difficult, forcing
#     her to take lighter tasks and rely more on others for heavy work.
#   reasoning: Age-related vision loss, hearing loss, arthritis/mobility impairment,
#     or post-infection weakness were common; not all reached the threshold of 'disability,'
#     but in an older laboring woman it is a substantial possibility.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 50s (c. 1835–1838)
#   type: acquired_disability

Seethamma was born on 1 December 1784 in a Telugu-speaking village in the dry Deccan country, under the Nizam’s rule. Soldiers and camp followers had been moving through the wider region during the wars with Mysore, and people talked about requisitions and stolen cattle when they met at the weekly market. Her home sat in a joint compound of her father’s people, clustered huts and a shared yard where grain was spread for drying and dung cakes were stacked for fuel.

She arrived after three funerals. Her oldest sister had died as a toddler in 1779. Another sister followed in 1783. Her only brother died in 1784, and the women said his spirit lingered near the house. Seethamma’s mother, Nagammani, kept her close and quick to the shrine. On Fridays she smeared the threshold with cow dung, lit a small oil lamp, and set turmeric, red kumkum, and a pinch of cooked rice near the stone for Pochamma at the edge of the settlement. Seethamma learned those movements before she learned any letters. She grew up hearing the names of diseases spoken with care: pox, fever, flux. When smallpox ran through nearby hamlets, the household kept neem leaves by the doorway and avoided visitors.

Mallesham, her father, worked a rented patch of land and spent other days taking wages on better-off men’s fields. Seethamma joined the work early. By eight she carried a small water pot from the well, shooed birds from the jowar, and picked up dropped ears after harvest. She liked the shade at noon, when women sat with their feet in the dust and shared a little tamarind rice if someone had it. She laughed easily when older women teased her about her skinny arms and called her “little mother” for how she hovered over younger children in the compound.

In 1798, when Seethamma was thirteen, the talk in the village shifted toward new demands. The Nizam’s officials and their men spoke of arrangements with the British and of money owed. The village accountant’s palm-leaf records mattered more. Men came with sticks to collect arrears; the household whispered about whether they could keep their small goats. Seethamma listened closely at the edge of adult conversations, quick to remember who had been forced to give grain and who managed to delay.

She married in 1802, at seventeen, to a man from the same cluster of hamlets, Kistaiah. He was a tenant on a small plot and did wage labor as needed. Seethamma moved into his family’s side of the settlement, still close enough to her natal compound that she could recognize voices at the well. Her mother-in-law, Buchamma, watched her hands and her pace in the fields. Seethamma worked without complaint when others were watching and slipped away when she could. She liked sitting on the low stone by the cattle pen at dusk, chewing betel leaf if she could get it, listening to men argue over the price of salt and the coming rains.

Her first child, a daughter, was born in 1804 and died within days. Seethamma washed the small body, wrapped it, and handed it over without a wail in front of elders. At night she could not sleep. Each time a dog barked, she sat up, listening for an infant cry that did not come. She began visiting Pochanna, a local pujari and healer, bringing a few grains of rice and a coin when she had it. He tied a thread at her wrist and told her to keep an offering of turmeric and neem near the hearth.

Kistaiah’s temper sharpened after the loss. In 1806 he began drinking toddy more often, coming home loud, joking in the lane, then sullen in the dark. In 1807, after Seethamma’s second daughter was born, he forced himself on her one night when she was feverish and sore from work and nursing. She resisted, then stopped. The next morning she moved slowly, avoided looking at anyone, and went to the well before the yard filled with women. The child died in 1808 after a short sickness; Seethamma’s hands shook when she tried to spoon water into the baby’s mouth.

A son arrived in 1811. Seethamma guarded him in a way that irritated Buchamma. She kept him close even while weeding, laying him on a cloth under a thorny bush and checking his chest for breath too often. When the boy caught fever and diarrhea in 1813, she ran between the well and the hut with water, begged for a pinch of jaggery to mix in, and spent the night repeating the goddess’s name under her breath. The boy died at two. After that she avoided paths near the burning ground and did not like hearing children’s laughter from the far side of the lanes. When someone brought news of another infant death, she snapped that people were careless, then turned it into a softer sentence to keep the peace.

In 1814, during an argument over grain and her hours in the fields, Kistaiah beat her in the yard. He struck her with his hand and then with a stick while his mother shouted and neighbors watched from their doorways. She stayed upright, wiping her face with the end of her sari. Bruises spread across her arm and shoulder. She did not go to any official; she took her pain to Pochanna and asked for a protective charm, then returned to the same courtyard.

The years after 1817 brought new fear. People spoke of cholera, of sudden deaths after vomiting and cramps. Travelers avoided certain wells; some villages halted festivals for a season. Seethamma carried water in smaller loads, washed vessels carefully, and still lost sleep when sickness passed through. Drought years came and went. When the monsoon failed, wages fell and grain prices rose, and Kistaiah took more days of labor away from their plot. Seethamma’s mind ran on lists—who owed whom, which woman at the well would lend a measure of grain, whose husband would enforce repayment with insults.

She was not careful with small things. A crack in the grain bin remained unpatched because she kept putting it off, telling herself she would do it after one more day’s work. She hid small handfuls of grain in the edge of her sari when she thought nobody saw, then acted offended when Buchamma questioned a missing measure. Once, to shift attention away from her own carelessness, she hinted that Somanna, a neighbor, had been seen near their yard at night.

After harvest in 1833, someone stole a sackful of jowar from an earthen bin near her hut. The yard showed no clear footprints in the hard ground. Seethamma accused Somanna’s household in a roundabout way, speaking to women at the well so the story would travel. Nothing came of it, and the household bought grain on credit. Kistaiah’s shoulders stiffened whenever a lender passed.

In 1836, after a hard fever season, Seethamma’s legs and hip never returned to full strength. She limped when she carried water. Bending for long weeding rows left her dizzy and sweating. She shifted to lighter work: sorting grain, stripping stalks, watching other people’s children for a handful of food. The loss of strength meant less money, and the debts did not pause.

Bad rains returned in 1839 and 1840. Rent and seed debts piled up. Men who collected for the landholders pushed harder; the Nizam’s revenue demands filtered down through intermediaries. In 1841 Kistaiah died after a brief sickness. Creditors came soon after. They took the goats and even the brass cooking pot, leaving Seethamma with clay vessels and a few rags. She moved into a small attached hut by the compound of her husband’s nephew, Chinna Kistaiah, cooking on a separate hearth but eating often from their pot when she could not earn enough.

She rose before sunrise, swept her patch of ground, smeared the threshold, and walked to the Pochamma stone with turmeric and a pinch of rice. Some days she earned a little by picking cotton or carrying fodder. Some days she returned with nothing and spoke sweetly to the women in the main house until someone set aside a ladle of gruel. She avoided quarrels when she could, then cut with sharp words when she felt cornered, quickly covering it with a laugh.

On 19 March 1851, while walking along the scrubby edge of the fields to collect fuelwood, she stepped near a coiled snake and was bitten low on the leg.
