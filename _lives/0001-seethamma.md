#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6
#     key_events:
#     - Born late 1784 soon after her older brother’s death; household frames her survival
#       as uncertain and increases protective goddess offerings.
#     - Experiences recurrent disease fear (smallpox/fever seasons) and learns early
#       to be quiet/pleasing to elders to avoid reprimand.
#     - Begins helping with small chores (watching goats, fetching light water pots)
#       in a land-poor household.
#     phase: Early childhood in a joint patrilocal compound
#   - age_range: 7-17
#     key_events:
#     - Subsidiary alliance era changes tax pressure and local authority; talk of dues/arrears
#       becomes normal household conversation.
#     - Learns fieldwork skills (weeding, harvesting, winnowing) and household production;
#       no schooling beyond recognizing a few marks at most.
#     - Develops strong ritual habit around grama devata for protection, especially
#       during fever outbreaks.
#     phase: Later childhood/adolescence under tightening Hyderabad rule
#   - age_range: 18-35
#     key_events:
#     - Marriage to Kistaiah (c. 1802) within the local hamlet cluster; she continues
#       heavy farm and domestic labor.
#     - Three live births (1804, 1807, 1811) followed by deaths (1804, 1808, 1813);
#       prolonged grief and hypervigilance consolidate.
#     - Domestic tensions rise after losses and during bad years; household relies on
#       wage labor and small tenancy.
#     phase: Married adulthood and repeated child loss
#   - age_range: 36-54
#     key_events:
#     - Cholera-wave years (post-1817) and recurring drought years disrupt labor and
#       food security; debts accumulate intermittently.
#     - Night theft of stored jowar after harvest forces borrowing and worsens relations
#       with neighbors (early-mid 1830s).
#     - Severe fever season leaves lasting mobility impairment (mid-late 1830s).
#     phase: Midlife precarity, epidemics, and theft
#   - age_range: 55-66
#     key_events:
#     - Husband dies around 1841; creditors seize goats and key utensils; she becomes
#       reliant on irregular wages and kin/patron food.
#     - Lives in a small attached hut/hearth beside a kin or patron compound, taking
#       lighter work (sorting grain, childcare, leaf/fuel gathering).
#     - Dies in 1851 from an accident/violence/snakebite event (already fixed), after

#     death_age: 6
#     death_year: 1784
#     narrative_role: Dies close to Seethamma’s birth; adults treat Seethamma’s infancy
#       as precarious and ‘watched’ by the village goddess, shaping her mother’s rituals
#       and anxiety.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Short-term food relief but damaged trust with neighbors/kin; contributes
#       to social isolation and harsher treatment when she becomes dependent.
#     scene: She quietly skims a handful of grain during threshing or misreports the
#       measure to a lender/landlord’s man, then acts innocent when challenged; later
#       she spreads a pointed rumor to divert blame for missing stores.
#     timing: midlife (ages 35-55), especially around the 1830s debt/theft period
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (0th percentile) — exploitative/deceitful streak
#   - consequence: Greater exposure to theft/spoilage and worsening arrears; others
#       in the compound criticize her reliability.
#     scene: She postpones repairing the grain bin or fails to keep careful track of
#       seed/loan obligations, leading to avoidable losses; she is more reactive than
#       planful in household management.
#     timing: adulthood (ages 20-60), highlighted before the jowar theft and debt crisis
#     trait: Conscientiousness (17th percentile) — low follow-through/impulsivity
#   - consequence: Reduces open conflict and preserves minimal support networks, but
#       also keeps her trapped in abusive dynamics.
#     scene: After quarrels she brings water, speaks softly, and accepts blame to stop
#       escalation; she mediates between in-laws and her husband to keep work going.
#     timing: throughout married adulthood and widowhood
#     trait: Agreeableness (80th percentile) — compliant/soothing style
#   - consequence: Improves day-to-day coping and bargaining, but cannot overcome structural
#       poverty; sometimes fuels suspicion/rumor-making.
#     scene: She picks up new weeding/seed-mixing tricks, herbal/home remedies, and
#       remembers market price patterns; she listens closely to travelers’ talk of taxes
#       and outbreaks even though she is illiterate.
#     timing: adolescence through midlife (ages 12-50)
#     trait: Openness (67th percentile) + Intelligence (62nd percentile) — quick learning
#       and curiosity within constraints
#   - consequence: Chronic insomnia and tension worsen health, strain marriage, and
#       make her more reliant on ritual specialists; contributes to social withdrawal
#       later.
#     scene: After each child death she has intrusive memories, startles at infant cries,
#       avoids certain spots (the riverbank path/cremation ground route), and performs
#       repeated protective rituals; during fever seasons she becomes sleepless and
#       irritable.
#     timing: begins in early adulthood (ages 20-30) and persists into old age, flaring
#       during epidemics and hunger years
#     trait: Trauma-/stress-related disorder (PTSD/complicated grief)
# number_of_children: '3'
# number_of_siblings: '3'
# occupation: 'Agricultural laborer (field work: weeding, sowing, harvesting) alongside

# structured_incidents:
# - event: After harvest, while storing a small share of jowar in an earthen bin near
#     her hut, someone stole a sackful at night; she suspected a neighbor but could
#     not prove it and the loss forced the household to buy grain on credit.
#   reasoning: Living in poverty with insecure housing and relying on kin/patrons raises
#     exposure to petty theft, wage/produce cheating, or loss of small valuables, though
#     outright robbery was less common than small-scale pilfering.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: late 40s (c. 1832–1836)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: Following a run of poor rains, her husband’s rented plot yielded little and
#     the household fell behind on rent and seed debts; when her husband died, creditors
#     seized their few goats and cooking vessels, leaving her dependent on irregular
#     field wages and food from kin.
#   reasoning: Her adult standing worsened into precariousness/indebtedness, and widows
#     without surviving children were at high risk of debt spirals, food insecurity,
#     and loss of whatever small assets they had.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: mid-50s to early 60s (c. 1839–1846)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: As a young married woman, she was forced into sex by her husband after he
#     returned drunk on toddy, despite her resistance and illness, and she had no recourse
#     within the household.
#   reasoning: In a patriarchal rural setting with early marriage norms, coercive sex
#     within marriage and occasional assault were real risks; widowhood and dependence
#     could also expose her to exploitation, but not all violence victims experienced
#     sexual violence.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 20s (c. 1805–1810)
#   type: sexual_violence
# - event: During an argument over missing grain and her work in the fields, her husband
#     beat her with his hands and a stick in front of other household members, leaving
#     bruising and days of pain but no formal complaint was made.
#   reasoning: Given marriage followed by widowhood and later dependence on kin/patrons,
#     the most common violence channel for a rural poor woman is physical abuse by a
#     husband or other household members (in-laws/relatives) during conflicts over labor,
#     food, or accusations.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late 20s to early 30s (c. 1813–1818)
#   type: domestic_violence
# - event: After a severe fever season, she developed lasting weakness and pain in her
#     legs and hip that made carrying water and bending in the fields difficult, forcing
#     her to take lighter tasks and rely more on others for heavy work.
#   reasoning: Age-related vision loss, hearing loss, arthritis/mobility impairment,
#     or post-infection weakness were common; not all reached the threshold of 'disability,'
#     but in an older laboring woman it is a substantial possibility.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 50s (c. 1835–1838)

Seethamma was born on 1 December 1784 in a small Telugu-speaking village in the dry Deccan country, under the Nizam’s authority and the local men who collected revenue and decided disputes. Soldiers and camp followers moved through the wider region during the war with Mysore, and her elders spoke of requisitions and fear on the roads. Her household lived in a joint compound with her father Mallesham, her mother Nagammani, and the older generation under Pedda Narasaiah’s control. They held no good land of their own. The men worked a rented strip and took wage work when the rains failed.

Before Seethamma could speak, the compound carried grief as part of daily talk. An elder sister had been born in 1777 and died two years later. Another girl, born in 1779, lasted to age four. Her only brother, born in 1778, died in 1784, weeks before Seethamma’s birth. The women handled those losses by routine. They washed, they wailed, they walked the body out, then returned to the courtyard to grind grain. Nagammani’s fear did not leave. She placed turmeric and neem at the doorway and kept a small lamp for the village goddess near the wall niche, and she brought Seethamma to the grama devata shrine with a pinch of rice as soon as the baby could be carried.

Seethamma grew into a thin, quick child with watchful eyes. She spoke only Telugu, the village speech, and learned the boundary paths by following the goats and younger cousins. In smallpox seasons her mother kept her close, rubbing oil and watching for spots. When strangers came to the village—messengers, wandering traders, a band of soldiers cutting across fields—Seethamma listened to the older men. She repeated scraps of talk later, mixing the words up to make the women laugh. She liked the taste of roasted peanuts sold in a leaf cone at the weekly market, and she timed her errands so she could watch the potter’s wheel spin before being sent away.

In 1798, when Seethamma was thirteen, the village heard new names more often: the Company’s officers in Hyderabad, the subsidiary troops, and the tighter demands of the state. The practical change came through paper and sticks: more visits from the revenue men, more talk of arrears, and less patience from those who could fine or seize. Pedda Narasaiah kept the family steady by sending the young men out for wage work after harvest and by accepting a smaller share from the rented plot. Seethamma worked alongside her mother in the fields—pulling weeds, carrying bundles of stalks, and winnowing with a flat basket when the wind came right. She never learned letters. When someone scratched a mark on a palm-leaf tally or pressed a thumb in ink, she watched closely, memorizing faces instead of words.

Her marriage took place in 1802, when she was seventeen. The groom was Kistaiah, a poor tenant cultivator from the same cluster of hamlets. She did not travel far; she moved to a house a short walk away, still within reach of her mother’s well path. The work did not change. She rose before first light, swept the yard, and walked with a brass pot to the tank for water. She cooked thin gruel, then went to the fields with a sickle and a cloth for her head. In the evenings she sat near the threshold, rubbing oil into her hands and ankles and feeding the lamp at the goddess shrine with a few drops.

Her first child came in 1804, a girl who died within days. The older women spoke sharply to keep her from falling apart. Seethamma did not sleep. She startled at the sound of any baby crying in the neighborhood, and she avoided the corner of the yard where the birth had happened. When her second daughter was born in 1807, she carried the child often, even while weeding, and kept her away from other children’s hands. The girl died in 1808 after days of loose stools and fever. Seethamma went to Pochanna, the pujari at the grama devata shrine, and followed his instructions exactly: a turmeric thread, a small offering, a night spent near the shrine wall. She also took the child to an herbal healer for bitter decoctions. After the funeral she began waking in the dark, touching her own arms as if checking that she was still there.

In 1806, after the first loss and before the second child’s birth, Kistaiah returned one night smelling of toddy. Seethamma was sick with a cough and refused him. He forced sex on her anyway. The next morning she moved slowly, careful in her body, and said nothing to her mother-in-law Buchamma. She learned how to keep Kistaiah from turning on her by speaking softly and by giving him food quickly when he came in hungry. She also learned how to lie with a calm face. When money went missing, she blamed a visiting cousin and watched the accusation land elsewhere.

Her son was born in 1811. For two years she treated him like a fragile object. She kept him close and refused to let other women carry him far. She did not laugh when others teased her for it. The boy died in 1813, after a fever that came with the late rains. Seethamma’s grief turned into routine panic. If a neighbor’s child coughed, she pulled away. During monsoon evenings she sat awake, listening for any unusual sound from the lane.

The household grew harsher. In 1816, after a quarrel about missing grain and Seethamma’s absence from one day’s fieldwork, Kistaiah beat her with his hands and then with a stick. Bruises darkened along her ribs and upper arm. Buchamma watched and told her to stop provoking him. Seethamma went to the well anyway the next morning, moving stiffly, and joked with another woman there—Saidamma, who worked the same fields—about how men counted grain with their mouths. They laughed quietly, then separated when an elder approached.

Cholera came into the region after 1817. People avoided travel and spoke in whispers about sudden deaths along the roads. The village also saw recurring fevers and the old fear of smallpox. In bad rain years the price of grain rose fast. Kistaiah rented the same plot when he could, and when he could not he joined groups walking out for labor on tanks and roads. Seethamma kept their small stores. She also took what she could. She pinched extra handfuls during threshing, hid them under a clay pot, and denied it when confronted. The habit kept her alive and made her unwelcome in some courtyards.

In 1834, after harvest, she stored a small share of jowar in an earthen bin near her hut. Someone stole a sackful at night. She counted again and again, hoping she was mistaken, then walked to Somanna’s house and stood at the edge of his yard until his wife came out. She spoke sweetly but pointedly. Somanna laughed and offered nothing. Seethamma could not prove anything, and the loss forced the household to buy grain on credit. That winter she avoided Somanna’s family at the well, changing her path and muttering under her breath.

In 1836 a fever season left her with lasting weakness and pain in her hip and legs. She no longer carried the largest water pots. Bending for weeding made her dizzy. She took lighter work—sorting stalks, guarding bundles, cleaning grain in the yard—while younger women did the heavy cutting. The change made her status in the compound smaller. She became sharper with her tongue when she felt cornered, then smoothed things over with small gifts of fuel and a ready smile.

Drought years returned, and debts piled up. By 1841 the rented plot yielded little. Rent and seed loans went unpaid. That same year Kistaiah died. Creditors arrived within days. They seized the family’s goats and took cooking vessels from the shelf, lifting them as if they belonged to nobody. Seethamma moved into a small attached hut beside her husband’s nephew, Chinna Kistaiah, and his wife. She earned food by doing what her body allowed—watching toddlers, sweeping, rolling fuel cakes, and walking short distances to collect thorny branches.

On 19 March 1851, Seethamma went at midday toward a scrubby patch beyond the houses to gather fuel. A snake struck her lower leg. She fell and shouted. People ran, tied a cloth above the bite, and carried her back to the compound. She died there before nightfall, at sixty-six.
