#     name: Rumo
#     narrative_role: Often away on hunts or forest collecting; warm but inconsistent
#       presence. Teaches Tali tracks, safe paths, and taboo places; his absences and
#       risk-taking feed her anxiety. Alive at her death, but frequently gone.
#     role: father (hunter/forager specialist)
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Sena
#     narrative_role: 'Primary stable caregiver; strict about chores and food storage.
#       Relies on Tali as her right hand. Relationship: affectionate but duty-heavy;
#       mother’s worry is mirrored and amplified in Tali.'
#     role: mother (subsistence cultivator/household manager)
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Dena
#     narrative_role: Enters after a household disruption (likely paternal remarriage
#       or reconstitution following separation). Competent but emotionally distant;
#       reinforces hierarchy and increases pressure on Tali to be exemplary. Source
#       of tension and occasional harsh discipline.
#     role: stepmother (in household by late childhood/adolescence)
#   - death_year: -339
#     name: Lumo
#     narrative_role: A stabilizing adult in early years who helps with childcare and
#       rituals; dies in a bad-fever year. Her death removes a buffer between Tali and
#       household stress.
#     role: paternal aunt or senior female cousin (early childhood helper)
#   children: []
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 9
#     connection: Following Mina’s death and a bad-rain year, Tali experiences a severe
#       fever/respiratory illness but survives; afterwards she develops stronger health-related
#       vigilance and avoidance of sick-houses.
#     incident: serious_health_incident
#   - age: 11
#     connection: A landslide/flood season damages paths and small plots; combined with
#       poverty, the household faces near-destitution and undertakes the regional move
#       (-338) to reattach to paternal kin/support.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 13
#     connection: In the new settlement, tension with stepmother and household discipline
#       escalates; one episode of harsh physical punishment (and/or coercive grabbing
#       by an older male at a work site) becomes a core memory feeding hypervigilance.
#     incident: victim_violence
#   - age: 16
#     connection: During a communal work day/market-adjacent gathering, cloth or a small
#       tool bundle goes missing; household mistrust rises and Tali becomes more controlling
#       about storage and counting.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 15
#     connection: During a lean period, Tali takes extra gathered forest food or a small
#       share of stored grain beyond what she was allotted, rationalizing it as preventing
#       waste; increases guilt and anxious rumination.
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   - age: 12
#     connection: Cares for her mother during a prolonged post-illness weakness and
#       manages cooking/water for weeks; cements her role as the household’s reliable
#       organizer.
#     incident: major_caregiving
#   - age: 16
#     connection: 'Recognized by elders for competence: leads girls in harvest processing
#       and is trusted with offerings/food distribution at a seasonal rite, elevating
#       her local reputation despite low birth status.'
#     incident: major_achievement
#   - age: 14
#     connection: A nearby valley experiences a raid/punitive patrol; she witnesses
#       displaced families arriving and hears accounts of violence, increasing night
#       vigilance and fear of strangers.
#     incident: warfare_impact
#   - age: 16
#     connection: Probability acknowledged but not required to occur; if it occurs,
#       most plausibly coercive or ambiguous premarital contact during travel or communal
#       labor. (Narrative can keep it implied or absent depending on later draw.)
#     incident: nonstandard_sexual_history
#   - age: 0
#     connection: Not planned; baseline expectation is continuity of local animistic
#       practice.
#     incident: religious_change
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-4
#     key_events:
#     - 'Learns household rhythms: carrying kindling, sorting edible greens, keeping
#       away from steep gullies during rains.'
#     - First strong memory of monsoon storms and slope failures; adults reinforce taboos
#       about certain ravines and spirit places.
#     - Younger sister Mina is born (-346), shifting Tali into an early helper role.
#     phase: Infancy and early childhood
#   - age_range: 5-9
#     key_events:
#     - Mina falls ill in a community fever season and dies at age 5 (Tali age 7; year
#       -341).
#     - Newborn brother Kelo dies soon after birth (Tali age ~6; year -343), deepening
#       maternal strain and household fear of sickness.
#     - A damaging rainy-season landslide/flood event disrupts paths and small fields;
#       the household leans more on foraging and careful storage.
#     phase: Middle childhood
#   - age_range: 10-14
#     key_events:
#     - 'Regional move within 10–50 km (approx. year -338; age 11): household re-forms
#       with paternal kin; Tali adjusts to new paths, new neighbors, and new spirit-offering
#       routines.'
#     - Begins to be noticed for beauty and competence; older women recruit her for
#       heavier tasks and more visible roles at seasonal rites.
#     - 'Anxiety becomes more explicit: sleep disrupted during storm season; frequent
#       checking of stored grain and embers; avoidance of certain forest corridors.'
#     phase: Later childhood / early adolescence
#   - age_range: 15-17
#     key_events:
#     - 'Moderate rise in local standing (ages 15-16; -334 to -333): attached to a locally
#       prominent household network while still living in a nuclear paternal/stepmother
#       unit—she is lent/requested for communal work and ritual preparation.'
#     - Increased exposure to market days/visiting groups (still local), heightening
#       both opportunities and vulnerability; remains never married.

#     death_year: -343
#     name: Kelo
#     narrative_role: Newborn brother who dies within days/weeks; remembered through
#       adult talk and ritual mentions. His brief life shapes the mother’s weariness
#       and the household’s sense of fragility.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Adults increasingly rely on her, contributing to her moderate rise
#       in local standing but also increasing pressure and self-blame when anything
#       goes wrong.
#     scene: As a pre-teen, she invents a simple counting-and-knot system for stored
#       grain/roots and remembers who borrowed what; she anticipates storm-season needs
#       and pre-stages fuel and water.
#     timing: ages 10-14
#     trait: High intelligence (90th) + high conscientiousness (78th)
#   - consequence: Chronic fatigue, irritability, avoidance of certain tasks/paths;
#       heightened reputation as ‘careful’ but also ‘too easily frightened’.
#     scene: 'Nighttime checking: wakes to listen for coughing, re-stokes embers repeatedly,

#       Mina’s; occasional panic-like surges during thunderstorms or when someone coughs.'
#     timing: begins ages 7-9; intensifies ages 12-17
#     trait: High neuroticism (73rd) manifesting as anxiety-spectrum disorder
#   - consequence: Helps her adapt after migration and contributes to being valued by
#       a prominent household, but can be read as restlessness.

#       to explain taboo boundaries rather than just obeying blindly.
#     timing: ages 12-17
#     trait: Moderately high openness (69th)
#   - consequence: Improves social opportunities and protection via prominent patrons,
#       but increases risk of coercion/harassment and intensifies her vigilance.
#     scene: Older women comment on her looks and manage her visibility at gatherings;

Tali was born in a high valley of the Guizhou plateau forests, where steep fields clung to slopes and paths ran along ridges. Her people spoke a local Tibeto-Burman tongue and lived under their own elders, but the lowlands to the north and west had new masters; Chu and Qin agents pressed and pulled at the fringes, and traders came up river-valleys with salt and iron. In Tali’s hamlet, power sat in households and kin groups, and in the places where offerings were set for the spirits of gullies, old trees, and rock ledges.

Her father, Rumo, carried bows and snares and left before daybreak for the forest. He returned with squirrel, pheasant, or a thin deer, and sometimes only with stories of tracks and a bundle of resinous wood. Sena, her mother, kept the small plots—millet on one terrace, beans in a patch nearer the house—and made sure the jars were covered and the fire never went out. Tali learned early to keep small things straight. She tied knots in a cord to mark how many baskets of grain remained and which jar held last year’s dried roots. When her mother set her to sorting edible greens from bitter leaves, she did it fast and without missing much.

A heavy rainy season came when she was four. Mud slid down a cut slope and tore a footpath away. Adults carried stones to shore up a terrace and told children to stay clear of the gully that “ate ground.” Tali watched water run brown and listened to her mother’s talk at night about food.

Mina arrived when Tali was three. By five, Tali could carry the baby on her hip while keeping one hand free for a basket strap. She liked the work at dusk, when the air cooled and the insects thinned. She sang short call-and-answer lines to make Mina laugh, and Mina answered with soft noises and a grin.

Kelo was born when Tali was six. He lived only a few days. Sena wrapped him in cloth and held him while Lumo, Rumo’s older sister, placed a small bowl of cooked millet and a strip of dried meat at the edge of the forest, where the household left propitiatory food for the local spirit that controlled sickness. After that, Sena’s shoulders stayed tight. Tali began waking at night to listen for coughing.

At seven, Mina fell ill during a season when several households reported fever. Mina’s breathing turned loud in the dark. Tali sat beside the sleeping mat counting her sister’s breaths and then checking the pot for water again and again. Mina died before the next new moon. Afterward, Tali avoided the house where Mina had been carried for help, and she kept away from other children when they sneezed.

The next year Tali caught a serious illness of her own. She spent days shivering and then sweating, unable to keep food down. Sena made thin porridge and pressed warm stones wrapped in cloth against her belly. Tali survived, but she stopped trusting her own body. She checked her skin for heat each night and insisted on sleeping closer to the hearth.

Lumo died when Tali was ten, after a bad fever year. Without her aunt, the household’s arguments sharpened. Rumo stayed away longer; Sena’s temper shortened. When the rains hit hard again and a slide cut off the nearest ridge path, the family’s small stores failed. Sena borrowed grain and owed labor in return.

At eleven, Tali walked with her parents to a different valley, within a day’s travel, to reattach to paternal kin who had a more secure house site. Dena, a woman from that kin group, entered the household as stepmother before the next planting. She ran the house with a hard voice, quick hands, and fixed rules. Tali learned the new paths, the new spring where water tasted of stone, and the new spot for offerings: a flat rock under a tree where the household left rice, egg, and a twist of fiber cord to keep the slope stable.

When Tali was twelve, Sena fell sick for weeks after a chest illness. Tali cooked, hauled water, and kept the fire fed while Dena took field decisions. She counted out grain for each meal and hid a small extra handful in a jar mouth for emergencies. At thirteen, Dena struck her hard with a stick for breaking a bowl while washing it. Tali kept her face still, then shook for an hour behind the house and checked the latch twice that night.

Her beauty drew attention once she filled out in her mid-teens. At communal work days, men watched her hands and her face. Tali stayed near older women, and when she walked she kept her eyes moving: slope, path, treeline, dogs. She also made herself useful. She organized girls at harvest to strip stalks and sort seed, and she remembered whose basket was whose. At fifteen she took extra forest food during a lean week, slipping it into the cooking pot when Dena’s back was turned. The guilt returned every night for days, with the same question repeated in her head until she slept.

At sixteen, cloth went missing during a gathering near a small market. Dena accused a neighbor’s girl; the neighbor accused Tali. Tali laid out every household item on a mat, counted them, and refused to speak until the counting finished. Jori, an elder woman tied to a prominent household network, saw how Tali kept order. She took Tali for several days at a time to help prepare offerings for a seasonal rite: cooked rice, millet cakes, and a chicken whose blood was dabbed on a stake at the edge of the fields. That work raised Tali’s standing. It also brought more eyes on her.

A raid hit a nearby valley when she was fourteen, and families arrived on foot with bundles and bruises. From then on, every unfamiliar footstep at night woke her. She slept with a stone near her mat and listened for dogs.

In early autumn of her seventeenth year, Tali returned from the fields with a sore throat and chills. The next day she could not work. Over several days her cough worsened and she developed a high fever. Sena and Dena boiled bitter leaves and fed her sips of water; Rumo came back from the forest and stayed at the hearth. Tali died on the fourteenth day of the tenth month.

They washed her body, wrapped it in cloth, and carried it to a hillside burial place used by the kin group. A bowl of grain and a small piece of dried meat were set beside her, and a fiber cord was tied to a nearby branch as a household offering to the local slope spirit.
