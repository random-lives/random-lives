# ethnicity: Han (Central Plains / Zhongyuan; Ming subject)
# father_occupation: Absent/deceased/unknown during her early childhood
# historical_context:
# - event: Late-Ming fiscal strain and expanding surtaxes/levies (e.g., ‘single whip’
#     silver taxes under stress, extra exactions to fund frontier wars) increasing local
#     burdens and market uncertainty
#   timing: childhood through adulthood, especially ages 15–35 (1620s–1641)
# - event: Banditry and rebel activity expanding in Henan in the late 1630s (including
#     forces later associated with Li Zicheng), increasing insecurity on roads and threatening
#     towns and market networks
#   timing: ages 30–35 (1635–1641)
# - event: Epidemic waves in North China during the 1630s–early 1640s (often recorded
#     as ‘great epidemics’), affecting urban populations through periodic high mortality
#     and disrupted commerce
#   timing: ages 28–35 (1633–1641)
# - event: Growth of lay Buddhist and syncretic religious societies in late Ming towns
#     (devotional associations, temple fundraising, merit-making networks) shaping community
#     life and obligations
#   timing: adulthood, ages 18–35 (1623–1641)
# household_social_status: Lower-commoner stable household (artisans, wage earners with
#   steady work, small vendors)
# household_structure_at_birth: Stem family with paternal grandparents present (husband’s
#   parents + father + mother + children)
# household_structure_at_death: 'Natal household as an unmarried adult: living with
#   her mother (and possibly a father-absent status), plus any remaining elder kin'
# language: Local Sinitic vernacular + some spoken Guanhua + literate in Classical Chinese
# literacy: Can read and write (functional literacy; can write letters/accounts/copy
#   texts)
# marital_status: Never married
# mental_disorder: No clear modern mental disorder (within typical range; stress/distress
#   not meeting criteria)
# migration: Stayed in the same locality (Luoyang/Yanshi area), no major move
# mother_occupation: Household management primarily (childcare, cooking, cleaning) with
#   limited paid work
# narrative_plan:
#   children: []
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 18
#     connection: Occurs when she is newly trusted with supplier errands due to literacy
#       and outgoing manner; leads to intensified devotion to Guanyin, increased guardedness
#       about going alone, and contributes to delayed/avoided marriage negotiations
#       due to fear of rumor.
#     incident: sexual_violence
#   - age: 23
#     connection: Workshop accident shifts her from physical tasks to accounts/coordination;
#       also increases household reliance on apprentices/servants for heavy work and
#       deepens her role as the 'brain' of the shop.
#     incident: serious_accident
#   - age: 27
#     connection: Recurrent winter cough/fever becomes persistent; interacts with late-Ming
#       epidemic waves and economic stress, reducing stamina and narrowing her daily
#       radius to home/shop/temple.
#     incident: chronic_illness
#   - age: 29
#     connection: Happens during grain-price spike and tense market conditions; reinforces
#       the sense of insecurity in the city and prompts changes like keeping less cash
#       visible and sending a male helper to handle confrontational customers.
#     incident: physical_assault
#   - age: 32
#     connection: Post-fever partial deafness increases dependence on written communication—tally
#       slips, ledgers—and on a trusted apprentice; heightens social strain but she
#       maintains role through literacy and conscientious routines.
#     incident: acquired_disability
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6 (1605-1611)
#     key_events:
#     - Raised in Luoyang/Yanshi natal compound with mother and paternal grandparents;
#       father absent/deceased/unknown so elders and mother structure the home.
#     - 'Frequent protective rituals after two infant deaths: incense to Guanyin, child-protecting
#       charms, careful avoidance of ''inauspicious'' visitors.'
#     - 'Early signs of verbal quickness: learns characters by watching accounts and
#       copying prayer slips.'
#     phase: Early childhood in a stem household
#   - age_range: 7-15 (1612-1620)
#     key_events:
#     - 'Becomes useful in the family shop/workshop: running messages, counting strings
#       of cash, copying simple receipts; literacy strengthens (Classical phrases for
#       temple petitions/ledgers).'
#     - Develops regular lay Buddhist practice (Guanyin devotion, chanting, small donations)
#       encouraged by mother and temple women’s circles.
#     - Marriage talk begins; she is evaluated for matches but household hesitates (father
#       absent; desire to keep her labor; concerns about dowry/security).
#     phase: Later childhood and early adolescence
#   - age_range: 16-22 (1621-1627)
#     key_events:
#     - Takes on more public-facing errands for suppliers; her high sociability makes
#       her a natural intermediary with customers and neighboring shops.
#     - A damaging coercive sexual incident creates fear of gossip; she and her mother
#       manage it quietly through temple vows and guarded routines.
#     - Despite social expectations, she remains unmarried; family’s standing begins
#       to improve through shop expansion and better connections.
#     phase: Late adolescence and early adulthood
#   - age_range: 23-30 (1628-1635)
#     key_events:
#     - Serious scald accident in the workshop; prolonged recovery changes her work
#       role toward bookkeeping and supervision rather than heavy carrying.
#     - Winter respiratory illness becomes recurrent and then chronic; she continues
#       working but with seasonal limitations.
#     - Tax/levy pressures and market volatility affect the shop; she helps navigate
#       credit, suppliers, and temple-network mutual aid.
#     phase: Established working adulthood amid late-Ming strain
#   - age_range: 31-35 (1636-1641)
#     key_events:
#     - Regional disorder grows (bandit/rebel activity); travel becomes riskier and
#       prices spike, increasing conflict in the marketplace.
#     - A high fever leaves her with partial one-ear hearing loss; she compensates by
#       relying on written notes and trusted intermediaries.
#     - Dies in 1641 from gastrointestinal infection amid broader epidemic/famine stress;
#       household performs Buddhist merit rites and careful mourning.

#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds trust and repeat customers, helps the family rise toward gentry-adjacent
#       standing; downside is reluctance to confront wrongdoing directly after the coercive
#       incident.
#     scene: She mediates disputes between customers and the shop, offering face-saving
#       compromises (extra measure, delayed payment plan) and smoothing quarrels between
#       elder kin in the compound.
#     timing: Most visible ages 12-30; especially in shop-front scenes ages 16-30
#     trait: Agreeableness (96th percentile)
#   - consequence: Expands the family network and credit access; also increases exposure
#       to public spaces, indirectly setting up risk for the supplier-shop coercion
#       and later market conflict.
#     scene: Becomes the household’s main public link—chatting with neighboring stalls,
#       temple sisters, and suppliers; energizes crowded festival days and organizes
#       small temple fundraising among women.
#     timing: Ages 10-35 (peaks ages 16-28)
#     trait: Extraversion (93rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Makes her indispensable despite being unmarried; enables status improvement
#       and resilience after injury/hearing loss through written systems.
#     scene: Keeps accounts accurately, catches inconsistencies in weights/strings of
#       cash, drafts polite Classical Chinese notes for suppliers/temple donations,
#       and learns basic legal/ritual formulas from borrowed texts.
#     timing: Emerges ages 7-15; becomes central ages 18-35
#     trait: High intelligence (93rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Stabilizes the shop under volatility; may contribute to overwork
#       and worsened fatigue once chronic illness begins.
#     scene: Maintains orderly ledgers, inventory tallies, and a strict routine of locking,
#       counting, and reconciling; during crises she rations cloth and cash carefully.
#     timing: Ages 15-35
#     trait: Conscientiousness (68th percentile)
#   - consequence: Protects the household from some scams/overextension during unstable
#       years, but may slow adaptation to shifting markets.
#     scene: Prefers proven methods—traditional dyes, established suppliers, familiar
#       devotional practices; skeptical of novel religious claims or risky new ventures
#       proposed by outsiders.
#     timing: Ages 18-35
#     trait: Low openness (21st percentile)
#   - consequence: Promotes caution and planning, but increases strain and social withdrawal
#       at times, especially after hearing loss.
#     scene: After sickness seasons or rumors, she becomes vigilant—double-checks locks,
#       worries about bad omens, sleeps lightly; seeks reassurance through chanting
#       and temple visits.
#     timing: Heightened after age 18 incident; again after chronic illness onset (ages
#       27-35)
#     trait: Moderately high neuroticism (66th percentile)
# number_of_children: '0'
# number_of_siblings: '2'
# occupation: Unpaid family helper in a small shop/workshop (family enterprise; may
#   keep simple accounts)
# religion: Popular practice plus regular Buddhist devotion (Guanyin/chanting, merit-making,
#   temple affiliation as laywoman)
# sibling_ages_at_death:
# - 0
# - 0
# sibling_sexes:
# - F
# - F
# structured_incidents:
# - event: While carrying bolts of cloth and account tallies to a nearby supplier’s
#     courtyard shop, she was cornered by the supplier’s adult male relative and coerced
#     into unwanted sexual acts, with threats that reporting it would ruin her family’s
#     reputation.
#   reasoning: For an unmarried woman in an urban setting, sexual coercion/assault risk
#     existed (harassment, coercion by local toughs or acquaintances), but living in
#     a gentry-adjacent natal household likely reduced exposure compared with servants,
#     migrants, or women living alone.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 17–19
#   type: sexual_violence
# - event: During a tense market day when grain prices spiked, a customer accused her
#     household of short measure and a fight broke out; she was struck and kicked by
#     the man and his companion as she tried to protect the cash box.
#   reasoning: Urban disorder and market/workshop interactions could produce non-domestic
#     violence (street assault, robbery-related beating), especially in the late Ming
#     crisis years, though her social standing offered partial protection.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 28–30
#   type: physical_assault
# - event: In the family workshop she slipped while carrying a heavy jar of dye/boiling
#     water and suffered a severe scald on her leg and hip, leaving her unable to walk
#     properly for several weeks.
#   reasoning: Accidents (falls, burns, work-related injuries) occurred, but for a woman
#     mostly in household/workshop settings, the rate of prolonged incapacitating injury
#     is moderate rather than dominant.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 23–24
#   type: serious_accident
# - event: After repeated bouts of winter cough and fever, she developed a persistent,
#     wasting lung illness with nightly coughing and fatigue that flared each cold season
#     and limited her work.
#   reasoning: A long-lasting condition (e.g., recurrent respiratory disease, chronic
#     gastrointestinal issues, anemia/weakness after infections) was fairly common by
#     the mid-30s in an era of high infectious burden and limited treatment.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 26–35
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: Following a high fever episode, her hearing in one ear was permanently reduced,
#     making it hard to follow rapid speech in the shop and forcing her to rely more
#     on written notes.
#   reasoning: Some serious illnesses or accidents led to lasting impairments (vision
#     loss from infection, mobility limitation from injury), but these were less common
#     than chronic-but-nondisabling illness.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 31–33
#   type: acquired_disability

郭翠莲 was born on August 28, 1605, in Yanshi near Luoyang in Henan, under the Ming dynasty. Her family spoke the local Central Plains speech at home, and the city’s public life ran on market rules, magistrate authority, and temple calendars. The taxes were counted in silver and demanded in paperwork, and even ordinary households felt the pressure of distant wars and officials’ levies.

She entered a household that held together by force of elders. Her paternal grandparents lived in the same compound, and her mother, Guo-shi, moved quietly but decisively through the rooms and courtyard. Two baby girls had already died in the same house. The first came in 1601 and the second in 1603; both died before their first month ended. When Cui莲 survived, her grandmother insisted on careful routines. Charms hung near the bed. Incense went to Guanyin. A small bowl of clean water sat by the door on certain days because an older neighbor said it helped.

Her father did not sit at the family table. No one spoke of him as if he might return. The grandparents treated the silence as settled fact, and the mother answered questions with a short, firm line and changed the subject. The household depended on women’s labor and on the small shop and workshop that faced the street. They handled cloth, thread, and dye, and they took in mending and piecework. Cui莲 grew up hearing the scrape of scissors on wooden boards, the slosh of wash tubs, and the counting of strings of copper cash.

By seven she watched the tallies. Her mother let her copy single characters on scrap paper, then on old account sheets turned sideways. Cui莲 learned quickly and asked for more. When her grandmother recited a household contract formula for a neighbor’s dispute, Cui莲 copied it and kept the slip under a jar lid, then brought it out weeks later when she heard the same phrase again. She liked the order of it. She liked knowing what people meant when they used official-sounding words.

She became the child who went to the gate. When vendors called, she answered fast and with a clear voice. When temple women came with a donation list, Cui莲 took the brush and wrote the household’s name neatly. She enjoyed the noise of festival days and stood near the street to watch the lion dance and the lantern sellers. She carried home sesame cakes, broke them into pieces, and teased her mother by pretending she had eaten them all.

In 1616 her grandfather died. The funeral moved through the courtyard with hired mourners, paper money, and bowls of rice set out for the spirit. Cui莲 wrote the list of gifts from neighbors while her mother checked each line, then sent her to thank the donors with a careful bow. After that, the grandmother held authority but moved less. Cui莲’s mother became the visible head of the inner household. Cui莲 followed her in the shop, learning to greet customers and to keep her face calm when someone complained.

By 1621 Cui莲 handled errands beyond the lane. She walked to suppliers with bolts of cloth balanced on her shoulder and a small packet of account tallies tucked inside her sleeve. She spoke easily, asked after families, remembered who preferred which weave. People accepted her presence because she spoke politely, smiled, and used the right forms. She also listened. She carried news back to the shop: a shopkeeper’s son had been pressed for a levy; a dyer’s apprentice had fled; a temple was collecting for roof repairs.

In 1623 she began attending a women’s chanting circle at a local Buddhist temple with a laywoman named Huizhen. They sat in a side hall, lit incense, and chanted Guanyin’s name. Cui莲 donated small coins and, when Huizhen asked, copied a short vow text in clean characters for another woman who could not write. She liked the temple’s order: the sound of chanting, the list of donors, the steady work of sweeping and arranging bowls.

In 1624, at nineteen, she went alone into a supplier’s courtyard shop run by Cheng Zhanggui. She brought cloth and tallies. Cheng’s adult relative, Cheng Erlang, pulled her into a side room where bolts were stacked. He forced sexual acts on her and told her that if she spoke, he would say she had enticed him and would ruin her family’s name. Cui莲 walked home slowly and washed herself until her skin reddened. That evening she wrote a short line on a scrap—only a date and two characters for “shame”—then burned it over the stove. She said nothing to neighbors. She told her mother in a low voice after the gate was shut. Her mother did not cry. She changed where Cui莲 went, sent a boy apprentice for certain errands, and took Cui莲 to the temple the next day to make a vow and a donation. Cui莲 stopped lingering at the street during festivals.

Marriage talks returned, then fell away. Cui莲 answered matchmakers with careful courtesy and never insulted anyone. She also made herself essential at home. She kept the ledgers. She wrote notes in Classical Chinese for suppliers. She trained the apprentice boy, Xiao’an, to recognize the household’s seals and to count the cash strings without shaving coins. Her grandmother died in 1627, and the mourning period tightened the household’s circle further.

In 1629 Cui莲 carried a heavy jar of hot dye water across the workshop floor. The planks were damp. She slipped and the jar tipped, scalding her thigh and hip. Her mother and Xiao’an tore her skirt away and poured cool water, then smeared ointment and bandaged the burns. Cui莲 lay on a kang bed for weeks, teeth clenched when she shifted. When she could stand again, she avoided heavy carrying and stayed nearer the account table. She moved papers and people instead of jars.

The 1630s brought tighter levies and harsher bargaining. Customers complained more. Suppliers demanded faster payment. Cui莲 kept calm voices in the shop. When two women argued over cloth width, she measured twice, gave a small extra strip, and sent them both away with polite words so they did not shout in the street. She liked the moment just after dawn when the street was quiet. She swept the threshold herself, then drank thin millet gruel with pickled vegetables before opening the shutters.

In 1632 she began coughing each winter. Fever followed, then weeks of fatigue. The cough returned every cold season and stayed longer each year. She still went to the shop, but she sat more. She wrote with a steady hand even when her chest hurt. She kept a cloth at her sleeve and turned her head away from customers when she could not hold back the cough.

In 1634, when grain prices jumped and tempers snapped, a man named Zhao Wu accused the shop of short measure. Cui莲 opened the cash box to show the tally and stepped between him and Xiao’an. Zhao Wu hit her. Another man kicked her when she fell. She stood again with help and ordered Xiao’an to shut the shutters. Her mother went to the neighborhood headman and demanded he record the assault. Cui莲 wrote the statement herself, line by line, in formal phrases she had learned from petitions.

In 1637 bandit and rebel activity in Henan made roads dangerous. Fewer rural traders came into town. The shop relied more on known contacts and temple networks. Huizhen’s chanting circle collected grain for families in trouble, and Cui莲 kept the list. She also kept watch for rumors and warned her mother when strangers asked too many questions about cash and stock.

In 1638 she caught a high fever during an epidemic wave. After it passed, her hearing in one ear dulled. She leaned closer to customers and missed quick speech in the noisy market. She adapted by watching lips, asking people to repeat, and using written notes. Xiao’an became her runner and her ears, repeating what others said while Cui莲 checked the numbers.

In April 1641 dysentery spread through the city. Cui莲 developed severe diarrhea and cramping. Her mother boiled water and rice, and Huizhen brought a small packet of medicine and a fresh incense stick for Guanyin. Cui莲 continued to write short notes until her hand shook too hard to hold the brush. She died on April 25, 1641, at thirty-five, in the natal household where she had been born.
