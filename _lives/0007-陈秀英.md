陈秀英 was born on January 4, 1813, in a farming village outside Baoding in Zhili Province under the Qing. Her family spoke the local Northern Mandarin and lived under the county yamen’s taxes and grain rules, with village temples and lineage obligations shaping the calendar.

Her father, 陈广田, managed the household’s fields as an owner-cultivator and hired extra hands at planting and harvest. Her mother, 李氏, ran the courtyard and the indoor work: boiling millet, keeping accounts of grain jars, spinning and weaving cloth, and watching the children. Five older siblings filled the rooms and yard. The eldest child had been a boy born in 1799 who died the same year. The next son, 陈长生, born in 1801, was already tall enough in 1813 to carry water and lead a donkey. 陈守仁, born in 1804, followed him through chores, quick to snatch at tools and wander off when scolded. Their sister 陈四姐, born in 1807, swept, fed chickens, and hushed the youngest brother 陈五弟, born in 1810, when he cried.

In summer 1813, the household stored grain and dried stalks near the cooking area. On August 20, 1813, while 李氏 worked and the older children moved in and out of the yard, 陈秀英 was left on the heated brick bed. She rolled into bedding near a charcoal brazier used to warm the room. The accident killed her that day.
