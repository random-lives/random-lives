# Debug information (not displayed on page):
# Age at death: 0
# Agreeableness (% rank): 11
# Birth date: January 17, 163768 BC
# Birth year: 163768 BC
# Climate now: Today the Sea of Galilee–Lower Jordan is a warm to hot semi-arid corridor
#   with strong summer heat, mild winters, and most rainfall in the cool season. River
#   flow and wetlands are heavily altered by dams, pumping, and irrigation, and the
#   lower river is much smaller and more saline/polluted in many stretches than it was
#   naturally.
# Climate then: Around 163,768 BC (Middle Pleistocene), the Levant was in a generally
#   cooler and, compared with interglacial peaks, more arid phase, though the Jordan
#   Rift still concentrated water and productivity. Lake levels and wetlands likely
#   fluctuated with multi-year to multi-millennial shifts in rainfall, expanding during
#   wetter intervals and contracting during drier ones. Vegetation in the valley would
#   have favored grasses and hardy shrubs with pockets of denser growth near perennial
#   water and springs.
# Conscientiousness (% rank): 18
# Cultural tradition: undifferentiated
# Death date: February 17, 163768 BC
# Environment: A deep rift-valley landscape centered on the freshwater Sea of Galilee
#   and the Lower Jordan River, with narrow riverine wetlands, reed beds and marshy
#   margins in places, and steppe-to-open-woodland slopes rising quickly to drier uplands.
#   People would have moved between lake/river resources (fish, waterfowl, reeds, grazing)
#   and nearby alluvial terraces and fans suitable for camps and small-scale foraging.

He had no spoken name that carried beyond the hearth. The small band that moved between the Sea of Galilee and the lower Jordan lived by fishing, gathering reeds and seeds, and taking gazelle when the hills opened after winter rains. Authority sat in older men and women and in the force of kin ties, not in any wider polity.

His mother, Tira, had already raised one boy, Dagan, born three summers earlier. She nursed him through bouts of cough and stomach sickness and carried him on long walks between lakeshore camps and the alluvial terraces. When she was heavy again, her mate Harun kept close to the water and the reed beds, setting traps and watching for other groups along the river corridor.

Harun died in the cold season before the new baby came. A fall on a stony slope broke his ribs; he lay a day and a night, then stopped moving. Tira’s brother, Salk, took Harun’s digging stick and net weights and came to Tira’s shelter. He slept at the edge of the camp and carried water for her.

The baby was born at the lake margin while geese fed in the shallows. Tira put him to the breast that day. The milk came thin and late. She ate what Salk and the others brought—fish, bitter greens, a little roasted grain—but she did not keep up with the group’s movements, and she missed meals when Dagan wandered and needed pulling back.

By the fourth week the baby’s mouth stayed dry after nursing, and his skin stayed loose over his ribs. One morning, before the fire was rebuilt, he lay still on the bedding and did not respond when Tira rubbed him with warm water.
