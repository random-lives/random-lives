# Debug information (not displayed on page):
# Age at death: 0
# Agreeableness (% rank): 11
# Birth date: January 17, 163768 BC
# Birth year: 163768 BC
# Climate now: Today the Sea of Galilee–Lower Jordan is a warm to hot semi-arid corridor
#   with strong summer heat, mild winters, and most rainfall in the cool season. River
#   flow and wetlands are heavily altered by dams, pumping, and irrigation, and the
#   lower river is much smaller and more saline/polluted in many stretches than it was
#   naturally.
# Climate then: Around 163,768 BC (Middle Pleistocene), the Levant was in a generally
#   cooler and, compared with interglacial peaks, more arid phase, though the Jordan
#   Rift still concentrated water and productivity. Lake levels and wetlands likely
#   fluctuated with multi-year to multi-millennial shifts in rainfall, expanding during
#   wetter intervals and contracting during drier ones. Vegetation in the valley would
#   have favored grasses and hardy shrubs with pockets of denser growth near perennial
#   water and springs.
# Conscientiousness (% rank): 18
# Cultural tradition: undifferentiated
# Death date: February 17, 163768 BC
# Environment: A deep rift-valley landscape centered on the freshwater Sea of Galilee
#   and the Lower Jordan River, with narrow riverine wetlands, reed beds and marshy
#   margins in places, and steppe-to-open-woodland slopes rising quickly to drier uplands.
#   People would have moved between lake/river resources (fish, waterfowl, reeds, grazing)
#   and nearby alluvial terraces and fans suitable for camps and small-scale foraging.

The band camped on an alluvial terrace above the reeds of the Lower Jordan, where freshwater and fish held even in the drier years. No chiefs governed the valley; families clustered around skilled hunters and older women who knew the springs, and they treated the river and the lake edge as places with watchful animal-spirits that had to be handled carefully.

His mother, Sira, already had one son, Tamm, born three winters earlier. She gave birth again in midwinter, close to the lake where the ground stayed soft and damp. The baby boy lived through his first days, small and quiet in her arms. His father, Karem, carried loads from the marsh and set nets in the shallows. He went out with two men to take gazelle on the steppe slope and did not return; they came back with torn skin and said a cat had taken him in the scrub.

After that, Sira’s milk did not come well. She tried to keep the infant to her breast and chewed bulbs and soft seeds to wet his mouth. Tamm fetched water in a skin from a seep above the camp, and an aunt laid warm stones near the sleeping place at night. The baby’s belly stayed slack. His mouth dried. On the thirty-first day he stopped taking milk.

Sira and her sister wrapped him in a reed mat and placed him in a shallow pit in sandy soil above the floodline. They set a handful of fish bones and a smooth lake pebble beside him, pressed the sand down, and covered the spot with cut reeds.
