# Debug information (not displayed on page):
# Age at death: 0
# Agreeableness (% rank): 11
# Birth date: January 17, 163768 BC
# Birth year: 163768 BC
# Climate now: Today the Sea of Galilee–Lower Jordan is a warm to hot semi-arid corridor
#   with strong summer heat, mild winters, and most rainfall in the cool season. River
#   flow and wetlands are heavily altered by dams, pumping, and irrigation, and the
#   lower river is much smaller and more saline/polluted in many stretches than it was
#   naturally.
# Climate then: Around 163,768 BC (Middle Pleistocene), the Levant was in a generally
#   cooler and, compared with interglacial peaks, more arid phase, though the Jordan
#   Rift still concentrated water and productivity. Lake levels and wetlands likely
#   fluctuated with multi-year to multi-millennial shifts in rainfall, expanding during
#   wetter intervals and contracting during drier ones. Vegetation in the valley would
#   have favored grasses and hardy shrubs with pockets of denser growth near perennial
#   water and springs.
# Conscientiousness (% rank): 18
# Cultural tradition: undifferentiated
# Death date: February 17, 163768 BC
# Environment: A deep rift-valley landscape centered on the freshwater Sea of Galilee
#   and the Lower Jordan River, with narrow riverine wetlands, reed beds and marshy
#   margins in places, and steppe-to-open-woodland slopes rising quickly to drier uplands.
#   People would have moved between lake/river resources (fish, waterfowl, reeds, grazing)
#   and nearby alluvial terraces and fans suitable for camps and small-scale foraging.

He was born without a fixed name, in a small band moving between the reed beds of the Lower Jordan and the drier slopes above the lake. There was no chief or temple in this valley; decisions came from elders and capable hunters, and the band’s rules were kept by talk, pressure, and the threat of being left behind. Their speech belonged to no language now recoverable.

His mother, Sira, already had one child living, a boy of three named Aru. Aru stayed close while the women cut sedge and gathered small seeds on the terraces. His father, Kalan, carried fish traps of woven reed and helped drive gazelle when the band ranged out from the water.

Kalan died when his second son was still in the first weeks of life. A sudden storm pushed hard down the rift. The river rose fast. Kalan went into the flooded edge to free a trap line and did not come back out. Men brought him in at dusk, slick with mud and weed.

Sira kept the infant against her skin and tried to feed him through the hot part of the day and the cold nights. Milk did not come steadily. She drank when she could, but the band's water was shared and carried, and her hands had to work. The baby cried, then grew quiet. On his thirtieth day, he died in Sira's arms at the camp on the alluvial fan above the marsh. They buried him in a shallow scrape near the edge of camp with a few flat stones over the place.

Two years later Sira bore another son, Taren. Three years after that she had a fourth boy, who died in his first days. Aru lived into old age, and Taren outlived them all.
