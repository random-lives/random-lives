# Debug information (not displayed on page):
# Age at death: 0
# Agreeableness (% rank): 11
# Birth date: January 17, 163768 BC
# Birth year: 163768 BC
# Climate now: Today the Sea of Galilee–Lower Jordan is a warm to hot semi-arid corridor
#   with strong summer heat, mild winters, and most rainfall in the cool season. River
#   flow and wetlands are heavily altered by dams, pumping, and irrigation, and the
#   lower river is much smaller and more saline/polluted in many stretches than it was
#   naturally.
# Climate then: Around 163,768 BC (Middle Pleistocene), the Levant was in a generally
#   cooler and, compared with interglacial peaks, more arid phase, though the Jordan
#   Rift still concentrated water and productivity. Lake levels and wetlands likely
#   fluctuated with multi-year to multi-millennial shifts in rainfall, expanding during
#   wetter intervals and contracting during drier ones. Vegetation in the valley would
#   have favored grasses and hardy shrubs with pockets of denser growth near perennial
#   water and springs.
# Conscientiousness (% rank): 18
# Cultural tradition: undifferentiated
# Death date: February 17, 163768 BC
# Environment: A deep rift-valley landscape centered on the freshwater Sea of Galilee
#   and the Lower Jordan River, with narrow riverine wetlands, reed beds and marshy
#   margins in places, and steppe-to-open-woodland slopes rising quickly to drier uplands.
#   People would have moved between lake/river resources (fish, waterfowl, reeds, grazing)
#   and nearby alluvial terraces and fans suitable for camps and small-scale foraging.

No chiefs or states governed the Jordan Rift then. A small band moved between the reed beds at the lake’s edge and the drier slopes above, tied to a few related families and to other bands met at water and fish runs. They spoke a local tongue with no written trace, and this boy died before a formal name settled on him.

His mother had already carried one son to childhood. That older boy, three winters old, followed her to the shallows where she checked woven traps and pulled mussels from mud. His father ranged farther, taking turns with other men along the terraces and into the steppe for gazelle and smaller game, and he came back with thorn scratches on his legs and a sling over his shoulder.

Near the cool-season rains, she gave birth in camp on an alluvial fan above the marsh. The baby was her second child, a boy, and he fed often. She kept him close under a hide wrap while she gathered bulbs and seeds near the water and brought reeds back for matting. After several days, his father left with others before dawn and did not return. The band brought his body back by late day, laid out on a reed mat, neck broken from a fall on rock.

With fewer hands, her milk thinned. The baby cried, latched, and pulled, then slept long and woke dry-mouthed. On his thirty-first day, at midday, he stopped taking the breast and died on her lap. Two years later she bore another son, and three years after that an infant who also died.
