# Debug information (not displayed on page):
# Age at death: 0
# Agreeableness (% rank): 11
# Birth date: January 17, 163768 BC
# Birth year: 163768 BC
# Climate now: Today the Sea of Galilee–Lower Jordan is a warm to hot semi-arid corridor
#   with strong summer heat, mild winters, and most rainfall in the cool season. River
#   flow and wetlands are heavily altered by dams, pumping, and irrigation, and the
#   lower river is much smaller and more saline/polluted in many stretches than it was
#   naturally.
# Climate then: Around 163,768 BC (Middle Pleistocene), the Levant was in a generally
#   cooler and, compared with interglacial peaks, more arid phase, though the Jordan
#   Rift still concentrated water and productivity. Lake levels and wetlands likely
#   fluctuated with multi-year to multi-millennial shifts in rainfall, expanding during
#   wetter intervals and contracting during drier ones. Vegetation in the valley would
#   have favored grasses and hardy shrubs with pockets of denser growth near perennial
#   water and springs.
# Conscientiousness (% rank): 18
# Cultural tradition: undifferentiated
# Death date: February 17, 163768 BC
# Environment: A deep rift-valley landscape centered on the freshwater Sea of Galilee
#   and the Lower Jordan River, with narrow riverine wetlands, reed beds and marshy
#   margins in places, and steppe-to-open-woodland slopes rising quickly to drier uplands.
#   People would have moved between lake/river resources (fish, waterfowl, reeds, grazing)
#   and nearby alluvial terraces and fans suitable for camps and small-scale foraging.

A male infant was born on January 17, 163768 BC on an alluvial terrace above the Lower Jordan River, where a small band kept winter camp near reed beds and a spring-fed side channel. No polity governed the valley. The group answered to older hunters and the women who controlled food sharing and shelter space, and they moved between the lakeshore and the drier slopes as water and game shifted.

His mother, Tira, already had one son, Karem, born in 163770 BC. Karem slept close to her and carried reeds to the hearth. The child’s father, Nahal, had brought fish and waterfowl through the cool season and had argued sharply with others over meat cuts. After the birth he left camp with two men to check snares in the uplands. A fall on rock killed him before he returned, and his body came back on a travois of branches.

Tira’s milk came thin and late. She kept the infant tucked against her skin and drank from the river, but her mouth stayed dry and her urine turned dark. Other women gave her sips from skin bags and pressed mashed wetland tubers to her lips. The infant took little and cried in short bursts, then lay still for long stretches.

On February 17, 163768 BC, in the morning, he died in the shelter while Tira sat upright and tried to feed him.

Karem lived into adulthood and died in 163708 BC. A younger son, Sulem, was born in 163765 BC and lived until 163675 BC. Another boy, Jor, was born in 163762 BC and died the same year.
