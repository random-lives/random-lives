# narrative_plan:
#   children: []
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 2
#     connection: Begins after toddlerhood; recurs each warm season, aligning with mosquito
#       pressure in the Arno/Valdarno landscape and shaping how closely she is supervised
#       and carried during work days.
#     incident: chronic_illness
#   - age: 3
#     connection: Occurs while following the older surviving sister near the family
#       plot; injury makes her more vulnerable during subsequent fever bouts because
#       she is less mobile and spends more time indoors/being carried.
#     incident: serious_accident
#   - age: 4
#     connection: Recurrence after the accident; coincides with increased household
#       stress around the pregnancy/birth of the youngest sibling (633).
#     incident: chronic_illness
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-2
#     key_events:
#     - Baptism soon after birth; mother resumes field/domestic labor while older surviving
#       sister (born 626) helps.
#     - Household routines shaped by tenant obligations under Lombard administration
#       (rent/labor days) and church feast days.
#     - Family mourning is still fresh from the 1-year-old sister who dies around 629.
#     phase: Infancy
#   - age_range: 2-4
#     key_events:
#     - First recurring late-summer fevers begin (malaria-like), with periods of weakness
#       between bouts.
#     - Birth of younger brother (631) changes childcare dynamics; Anna alternates between
#       play and being kept close due to sickness.
#     - Serious leg injury from ditch fall (632) leads to weeks of immobility and being
#       carried while the family works.
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 4-5
#     key_events:
#     - Fevers recur more severely in warm season; family seeks prayers/blessings and
#       home care (cooling, broths, rest).
#     - Youngest sister is born (633), increasing exposure to household infections and
#       straining mother’s time.
#     - Terminal malaria-like fever episode peaks in late summer 634 leading to death
#       on 3 Sept 634.

#     her unable to walk properly for several weeks and needing to be carried.
#   reasoning: Rural small children did have notable accident risk (falls, burns, animal-related
#     injuries), but serious long-incapacitating accidents are less common than severe
#     infections in this setting and age group.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 3–4 (spring–summer 632 AD)
#   type: serious_accident
# - event: Over multiple warm seasons she suffered bouts of recurring fever with chills
#     and exhaustion consistent with marsh-fever (malaria), leaving her weak and intermittently
#     unable to help with small household tasks or play.
#   reasoning: A substantial share of surviving children carried chronic burdens (recurrent
#     fevers/malaria, intestinal parasites, chronic cough, anemia/malnutrition) that
#     could limit activity for months or years.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 2–5 (c. 631–634 AD, worst in late summers)

Anna was born on February 21, 629, in a scattered farmstead above the Arno valley, on land held from a landlord under the Lombard kingdom. Her parents, Martinus and Lucia, spoke the local Romance speech that had grown from Latin, prayed in the village church, and measured the year by rents, labor days, and feast days. Lucia carried Anna to the priest for baptism and then went back to the fields and the yard work. Cecilia, the sister born in 626, watched the smaller children when Lucia hoed and gleaned. In the same year Anna learned to walk, the little sister born in 628 died, and Lucia kept the child’s swaddling cloth folded in a chest with a small cross-token from the church.

In 631 Lucia bore a son, Paulus. The baby’s crying filled the house at night, and Anna, quick to run and quick to speak, pushed herself into every task. She grabbed at the spindle when Lucia spun. She took food from the bowl before it was given. When she was scolded she answered back in short, loud bursts and then ran out to the yard.

Late in the summer of 631, Anna began the fevers that came with the mosquito season. One day she played by the doorway, the next she lay on a pallet under a wool cloth while Lucia pressed cool water on her arms and Martinus returned from the animals at dusk. The priest, Presbyter Iohannes, came once with prayers and a blessing, and Lucia hung a small worn cord with a cross-knot near Anna’s sleeping place.

In 632, when the grain stood high, Anna followed Cecilia along the edge of a field where water ran in a stone-lined ditch. She slipped, dropped hard, and twisted her leg. She did not walk for weeks. Cecilia carried her on her hip while Lucia cut weeds and gathered fuel, and Martinus kept the herds closer to home.

Lucia gave birth again in 633, a girl named Maria. Anna’s fevers returned in late summer 633 and again in 634, with shaking chills and long exhaustion. On September 3, 634, after days on the pallet while Lucia and Cecilia fed her thin broth and water, Anna died at five years old. Presbyter Iohannes said the burial prayers and the family brought her to the churchyard.
