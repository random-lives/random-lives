Anna was born in February 629 in the hills above the Arno valley, in a scatter of farms under the Lombard kingdom. Royal officers and local lords took dues through estate agents. Her family spoke the local Romance speech that had grown out of Latin. They prayed in the village church and marked days by saints’ feasts and the priest’s visits.

Her father, Marcus, spent most days with sheep and goats, pushing them along rough paths between scrubby woodland and grazed edges of fields. Her mother, Livia, worked where she was needed—hoeing, binding sheaves, hauling water, and coming back to the house to grind grain and settle quarrels. Anna was the sixth child born; five older sisters had already filled the yard with noise. Only a few stayed long. One sister died in infancy, another before she could speak in full sentences. The older ones carried the youngest on their hips and tried to keep them from the animals.

Anna ran toward any movement. When the flock came back, she followed the older girls to the edge of the plot and called out to her father, loud and sharp. At three she trailed behind them along a stone-lined ditch cut to drain water off the field. Her foot caught on the edge stones. She went down hard into the shallow channel and twisted her leg. For weeks she moved only when someone lifted her. Livia carried her to the shade by the doorway and set her down with a cup of watered wine and bread softened in broth.

Fevers had already started. Each warm season brought days of chills and shaking, then sweating, then a flat tiredness that kept her from play. When talk reached the farm of sickness in a nearby town—another wave of the old plague—Marcus kept the children close and avoided crowded markets.

In late summer of 634, the fevers returned and did not break. Anna died on September 3, five years old, in the house where she had been born.
