Anna was born on February 21, 629, in a tenant household on the hills above the Arno valley, in the Lombard kingdom. Her family spoke the local Romance speech descended from Latin and went to the village church for baptism and the great feasts. Her father, Marcus, herded sheep and goats for a landlord’s estate and brought part of the increase and wool as due. Her mother, Lucia, hoed and harvested when she had to, and kept the hearth, the garden strip, and the children in order.

Seven older siblings filled the house yard. Five sisters had come first, then a brother, then another sister. The older girls carried water and gathered kindling; the boy, Paulus, followed Marcus when he could. Anna attached herself to Paulus and trailed after him with quick steps and loud demands. She grabbed at what the older children held and pushed back when they tried to steer her away from animals or tools.

When she was two, the warm months brought shaking fevers. Lucia wrapped her in a blanket and laid her on a rush mat near the doorway to catch air. A priest came once to pray and make the sign of the cross over her. The fevers broke and returned. Some summers the markets in the nearby towns fell quiet because sickness had spread again, and fewer traders came up the road.

In the spring of 632, Anna followed her sisters to the edge of the family plot where water ran in a stone-lined ditch. She slipped, landed hard, and twisted her leg. For weeks Lucia carried her on a hip to the garden, to the threshing place, and to Mass. Anna struck out at the arms that held her and demanded to be set down before she could stand.

Late in August 634 the fevers returned with chills. She stopped taking food. On September 3, 634, Anna died in the house, with Lucia washing her face and Marcus back from the grazing grounds. She was five years old.
