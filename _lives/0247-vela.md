# Debug information (not displayed on page):
# Age at death: 49
# Agreeableness (% rank): 20
# Birth date: August 2, 10410 BC
# Birth year: 10410 BC
# Climate now: Today the same region has a warm-temperate to Mediterranean climate with
#   hot summers and mild, wetter winters. The lowlands are heavily modified by agriculture
#   and urbanization, with regulated rivers, drained wetlands, and a coastline closer
#   inland than it was in 10410 BC due to higher sea level.
# Climate then: The climate was cool and generally dry compared with today, in a late-glacial
#   setting with strong seasonality and frequent cold spells. Vegetation was mostly
#   open woodland and parkland rather than dense Mediterranean forest, with productive
#   wetlands and river margins concentrating game, fish, birds, and edible plants. Lower
#   sea levels expanded coastal habitats and shifted estuaries and resource zones seaward.
# Conscientiousness (% rank): 57
# Cultural tradition: Late Epigravettian
# Death date: December 11, 10361 BC
# Environment: A mosaic of river floodplains, marshy backwaters, and braided channels
#   along the lower Tiber and Arno, grading into pine-juniper woodland patches, open
#   steppe-like grasslands, and low hill country. The coastline lay farther west than
#   today, with wider coastal plains and dune-lagoon systems because sea level was much
#   lower.

#     phase: early childhood
#   - age_range: 8-17
#     key_events:
#     - Develops a reputation as quick-eyed for edible shoots, tubers, and bird eggs;
#       also as sharp-tongued and easily spooked by threats (storms, strangers, illness).
#     - Maternal grandmother dies (age ~14), prompting a stricter emphasis on winter
#       preparation and camp placement.
#     - Premarital relationship with Nalo during a summer coastal-plain lagoon gathering
#       (age 15–16).
#     phase: later childhood & adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-29
#     key_events:
#     - Pregnancy outside a formalized partnership; gives birth to Oni with mother and
#       sister’s support (conceives at 21, birth at 22).
#     - Forms a primary partnership with Tima, while also maintaining a concurrent relationship
#       with Dena (ages 22–29), causing recurring disputes and reputational strain.
#     - 'Victim of property crime at a winter aggregation: her fiber bag with tools
#       and dried tubers is stolen (age 27, late winter), forcing dependence on borrowed
#       tools.'

#     - Caregives for Sena during a prolonged chest illness spanning two seasons (age
#       31–32), using wetland foods and aromatic plants.
#     - Father Kari dies (Vela ~37), shifting responsibilities toward Vela and increasing
#       her anxiety and defensiveness.
#     - Oni enters late adolescence/early adulthood; Vela’s conflicts lessen somewhat
#       as her role becomes more skill-based and practical.
#     phase: midlife
#   - age_range: 40-49
#     key_events:
#     - Sustained caregiving for her mother Luma as mobility declines (ages 40–46),
#       managing camp logistics and easier foraging routes.
#     - Mother dies (Vela ~46), followed by increasing episodes of weakness and cold-season
#       hunger sensitivity.
#     - Oni dies at 26 (when Vela is ~48), after which Vela’s frailty accelerates; she

#   - name: Tima
#     narrative_role: 'Primary adult partner through her early 20s into late 20s; a
#       capable fisher/bird hunter in the marsh margins. Relationship is workable but
#       volatile: frequent arguments (Vela’s suspicion and bluntness), yet practical
#       cooperation around food and camp tasks.'
#     relationship_end_year: -10380
#     relationship_start_year: -10388
#   - name: Dena
#     narrative_role: Secondary concurrent partner overlapping Tima, especially during
#       aggregations; the relationship is partly desire, partly alliance. Creates ongoing
#       tension and jealousy in the camp, with periodic confrontations but tolerated
#       due to kin ties and shared provisioning.

#     name: Sena
#     narrative_role: Older sister and primary same-sex peer/ally; competent and steady
#       where Vela is prickly and anxious. Their bond is practical (shared gathering,

#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: -10412
#     name: Arno
#     narrative_role: Infant brother who died soon after birth; remembered indirectly
#       through mother’s grief and later as a cautionary story about winter sickness
#       and bad air in damp camps.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Irritability, suspicion, and occasional social friction; also makes
#       her vigilant about sickness and camp hazards, sometimes preventing mistakes.
#     scene: Repeated checking of bedding dryness and fire, waking at night to listen
#       for strangers/animals, catastrophic worry during cold spells and after minor
#       injuries.
#     timing: appears from later childhood; peaks after father’s death and again after
#       son’s death (midlife to final years).
#     trait: Neuroticism (very high)
#   - consequence: Reputation for being difficult; contributes to relationship instability
#       and to being targeted/unsupported when her tools are stolen.
#     scene: Blunt criticism of others’ foraging choices, quick escalation in disputes
#       over tool lending and paternity talk, reluctance to soothe conflicts she thinks
#       are 'deserved.'
#     timing: most visible in adolescence and early adulthood (ages 13–29), then moderated
#       by caregiving responsibilities.
#     trait: Agreeableness (very low)
#   - consequence: Develops recognized plant knowledge; becomes useful during Sena’s
#       illness and in advising on seasonal gathering.
#     scene: Experiments with new plant preparations (leaching bitter roots, mixing
#       aromatics), curiosity about distant resource patches and other bands’ habits
#       during aggregations.
#     timing: adolescence through midlife.
#     trait: Openness (high)
#   - consequence: Contributes to unconventional partnership arrangements and anxiety
#       about being replaced; reinforces abrasive interpersonal style.
#     scene: Others make unkind jokes or treat her as less desirable for a 'prestige'
#       pairing; she leans into competence and boldness rather than charm.
#     timing: late adolescence and early adulthood, especially at aggregations where
#       mate choice is more visible.
#     trait: Physical attractiveness (very low)
# number_of_children: '1'
# number_of_siblings: '2'
# parents_status: both parents together
# partnership_history: multiple concurrent partners
# sibling_ages_at_death:
# - 79
# - 0
# sibling_sexes:
# - F
# - M
# social_standing: ordinary member
# special_skills: skilled gatherer/plant knowledge
# structured_incidents:
# - event: During a cold-season aggregation near the lower Tiber marshes, someone from
#     another hearth-group took her woven fiber bag containing a flint scraper, bone
#     awl, and a small bundle of dried wetland tubers while she was out digging and
#     checking traps; it was never returned and she had to borrow tools until replacements
#     were made.
#   reasoning: Most property was communal/low-accumulation, but personal items and food
#     could be stolen, especially amid seasonal scarcity; opportunities exist but are
#     lower than in settled, wealthier societies.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 27 (late winter)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: She spent weeks caring for an older sister with a lingering chest illness
#     after repeated cold, damp nights on the floodplain—keeping the fire fed, bringing
#     broth-like stews of waterfowl and shellfish, and gathering aromatic plants to
#     ease breathing while the sister was too weak to forage.
#   reasoning: In small late-glacial forager bands, injuries and infections were common
#     and care was largely provided by close kin; as a middle-aged woman with strong
#     plant knowledge, she would be a likely caregiver during prolonged illness or disability
#     episodes.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 31–32 (one sustained period across two seasons)
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: 'As her mother’s mobility declined with joint pain and weakness, she became
#     the main helper in camp: carrying water from side channels, collecting easy-to-reach
#     reed rhizomes and greens, and arranging sleeping places closer to the fire and
#     away from the wet ground during moves between river-margin camps.'
#   reasoning: She lived to 49, which increases the chance at least one parent survived
#     into old age needing support, but many parents would have died earlier; primary
#     caregiving depends on proximity and sibship (she had only one surviving sibling).
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 40–46 (recurring pattern, intensifying in the last year)
#   type: elderly_parents
# - event: In her mid-teens, during a summer stay on the coastal plain near dune-lagoon
#     wetlands, she began a consensual sexual relationship with a slightly older youth
#     from a neighboring band she met at shared fishing and bird-hunting spots, before
#     any stable pair-bond was recognized by the group.
#   reasoning: Many forager societies tolerate adolescent/young-adult sexual activity
#     before stable partnership, and her later concurrent-partner pattern suggests relatively
#     permissive or flexible norms for her personally.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 15–16 (single short period)
#   type: premarital_sex
# - event: While living in a primary partnership, she also maintained an ongoing sexual
#     relationship with another man in the camp—more openly during seasonal aggregations—creating
#     tension and periodic disputes but tolerated because of overlapping kin ties and
#     shared provisioning.
#   reasoning: Given her confirmed history of multiple concurrent partners, sex outside
#     a primary pair-bond (even if informally recognized) is very likely at least once.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 22–29 (recurring pattern)
#   type: extramarital_sex
# - event: She conceived during a time when her partnerships were unsettled and not
#     publicly formalized; the child’s paternity was treated as ambiguous, and she relied
#     heavily on her mother’s and sister’s help through late pregnancy while continuing
#     lighter gathering along the river margins.
#   reasoning: Formal 'marriage' is often less rigidly defined in forager contexts,
#     but pregnancy occurring outside an established partnership is still plausible,
#     especially with concurrent partners.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 21 (pregnancy and birth through age 22)
#   type: pregnancy_outside_marriage

Vela was born into a Late Epigravettian band that moved between the lower Tiber and Arno floodplains, the dune-lagoon coast, and low hills when weather or game pushed them. No chiefs directed them. Families clustered into hearth groups, argued, traded favors, and split and rejoined with the seasons. Their ritual life centered on animals, water places, and the dead; they kept small bundles of red ochre, beads, and teeth, and they spoke to kin who had died as if the kin could still hear.

Her mother, Luma, carried her through wet reedbeds and over sand ridges while the sea lay far out on the coastal plain. Her father, Kari, came and went with hunting parties and with days of fishing the braided channels. Vela’s older sister, Sena, was already a helper when Vela was small—steady hands at the fire, quick at scraping hides, patient with children. Between them there had been a brother, Arno, born two years before Vela. He died as an infant, and the story of it stayed in the family: a cold spell, damp bedding, a cough that never settled. Luma said it plainly whenever someone wanted to camp too close to standing water.

Vela grew tall and strong, long-legged, able to carry loads of reeds and roots. People did not look to her for sweetness. When she was frustrated, she spoke like a tool striking stone—sharp, quick, and loud enough that other hearths turned their heads. Kari tried to correct her, and she snapped back at him when she was ten, then hid behind a willow tangle by a side channel until her anger passed. She returned with her hands stained from digging and a clump of reed rhizomes to drop at the fire, as if it settled the dispute.

Luma and Sena taught her plants first. She learned where the ground held edible tubers, which greens came early in spring, and which bitter leaves calmed an upset belly when steeped in hot water. She liked the work that took her away from the center of camp. On anxious days she checked and rechecked her carrying strap, retied knots, then retied them again. When strangers appeared—another band arriving to share a fishing place—she stood close, jaw tight, scanning hands and faces.

At fourteen, her maternal grandmother Riva died after a hard winter. Vela watched the older women rub fat into Riva’s cracked hands and bind her feet with strips of hide to keep swelling down. After the burial, Luma shortened their moves and chose higher ground more often. Vela followed those choices and complained anyway, because she wanted the river fish even when the river meant damp cold.

When she was fifteen, the band spent a warm season on the coastal plain near dune-lagoon wetlands. People gathered in larger numbers there. Nets went into shallow water, and boys chased birds into lines of waiting adults. Vela took up with a youth named Nalo, a little older than she was, quick to laugh and quick to touch. They slept near the edge of camp where the wind came off the dunes. Sena teased her once, and Vela cursed at her, then later shared a piece of roasted eel in apology. When the season ended and groups separated, Nalo left with his kin inland. Vela watched him go without calling after him.

At twenty-one, her partnerships were unsettled and public talk circled her like flies. She had sex with more than one man, and she did not hide it well. She conceived that year. Luma kept her close, sent Sena with her for gathering, and made sure she ate first when meat came in. Vela kept working along the river margins, taking lighter loads, digging the easier patches of rhizomes and carrying bundles of greens. She gave birth at twenty-two with her mother and sister crouched beside her, and the baby lived. They named him Oni.

In the years after Oni’s birth, Vela took a primary partner, Tima, a marsh hunter who set bird snares and moved quietly through reedbeds. She also kept an ongoing relationship with Dena, a man attached to another hearth group in the camp, and the overlap became open during seasonal aggregations. The arrangement brought food and attention, and it brought shouting. Tima accused her of disrespect in front of others; Vela answered with the ugliest words she had. Once, Mara—an older woman skilled with hides—pushed between them and assigned Tima to mend nets while she ordered Vela to fetch water. Vela did it, shoulders rigid, then returned and dumped the water down hard enough to splash their feet. Later she fed Oni chewed bits of roasted waterfowl and stared past everyone at the dark line of trees.

Vela’s child was small enough to carry when she went out to dig. She tied him against her hip with a sling and bent to the work, listening for the thin cry that meant hunger or cold. Sena helped more than Tima did. Vela took pride in the plants she brought back: the clean white cores of sedge, the sweet shoots, the bundles of bitter herbs that made the stews taste sharp and kept people from complaining of stomach pain.

At twenty-seven, during a cold-season aggregation near the lower Tiber marshes, she left her woven fiber bag at the edge of the digging ground while she checked traps. When she returned it was gone—her flint scraper, her bone awl, and a small bundle of dried tubers saved for travel. She went straight to the nearest hearth and accused a young man from another group. He denied it. Vela demanded to search his pack, and the argument drew a ring of watchers. No one handed the bag back. Mara forced an end by ordering people to move on before the light faded. Vela had to borrow tools until replacements were made, and she watched other hands more closely after that.

Her relationships shifted as Oni grew. The fights with Tima wore at them. Dena drifted to a different camp line. By twenty-nine the talk quieted because there was less to say; Vela kept her work, her child, and her distance.

At thirty-one, Sena fell ill after a stretch of cold, damp nights on the floodplain. The cough stayed. Sena’s breath rasped, and she could not walk far without stopping. Vela took over her tasks for two seasons. She fed the fire through the night, brought broth made from waterfowl and shellfish, and gathered aromatic plants from drier patches to steep in hot water so Sena could breathe easier. Sena, feverish and irritable, snapped at her once. Vela snapped back, then sat outside the shelter for an hour, picking grit from a bundle of roots with shaking hands, angry at her sister for being sick and angry at herself for thinking it.

When Vela was thirty-seven, her father Kari died. He went out with others, returned with a cut that turned bad, and within days he was gone. Vela argued at the burial about where to place him, insisting on higher ground. She spoke to his body before they covered it: instructions about keeping Oni safe, scolding that sounded like a conversation they had never finished.

In her forties, her mother’s joints stiffened and pain took away her stride. Luma could not cross slick mud without help. Vela became the main helper in camp, carrying water from side channels, collecting easy-to-reach reed rhizomes and greens, and arranging sleeping places closer to the fire and away from wet ground. She pushed others hard when they complained about moving slowly for Luma. Once she told Zana, a peer who liked to gossip, to shut her mouth or carry the old woman herself. Zana laughed, and Vela laughed once too, surprised by it, then returned to tightening the carrying strap.

Luma died when Vela was forty-six. After that, Vela slept worse. She chewed certain bitter leaves in the mornings because she said they kept her stomach settled. She still liked the first quiet hour after dawn, when the marsh birds were loud and people had not started arguing.

Oni reached adulthood and became competent along the river edge, working with a younger man, Kena. Oni died at twenty-six when Vela was forty-eight. After that loss, she stopped pushing herself to the best patches and took what was nearest. Hunger hit her harder in the cold season, and joint pain and weakness kept her close to the fires.

Vela died at forty-nine during a period of decline in early winter, when food was thin and the nights were long. Her kin placed her in the ground on a sandy rise above the floodplain, dusted red ochre over her, and set a small flint piece and a handful of wetland seeds beside her before covering her with soil and brush.
