# - event: 1911 Xinhai Revolution and the transition from Qing to Republic in Xinjiang,
#     bringing administrative uncertainty, changing officials, and disrupted tax/justice
#     routines
#   timing: late 20s (1911–1913)
# - event: Yang Zengxin’s consolidation of Xinjiang (relative order but strong policing,

#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Stability and fewer risky ventures, but he is slower to adapt during
#       the 1930s turmoil and relies heavily on kin guidance.
#     scene: He prefers familiar routes, customary bargains, and established elders’
#       judgments; he distrusts new political slogans and avoids experimenting with
#       new herding/farming methods unless pressured.
#     timing: visible from adolescence through midlife (1898–1930)
#     trait: Low Openness (17th percentile)
#   - consequence: Improves access to wage work and militia placement; also increases
#       exposure to disputes and violence in public spaces.
#     scene: At bazaars and camps he is the talker and connector—negotiating small jobs,
#       mediating minor disputes, and building rapport with Chinese-speaking officials
#       or traders.
#     timing: strong in young adulthood and midlife (1904–1930)
#     trait: High Extraversion (81st percentile)
#   - consequence: Maintains 'ordinary respected' standing despite being a laborer;
#       becomes a default helper in caregiving and community obligations.
#     scene: He keeps careful verbal accounts, returns borrowed tack/tools promptly,
#       and refuses obvious scams or cheating weights even when others do it; he is
#       trusted with escorting goods.
#     timing: young adulthood onward (1906–1943)
#     trait: Very high Honesty-Humility (91st percentile)
#   - consequence: Prepares diligently and avoids some dangers, but contributes to irritability
#       that can flare during wage disputes.
#     scene: Under uncertainty (tax demands, rumors of fighting) he becomes tense and
#       vigilant, sleeps poorly, and repeatedly checks animals/gear before travel.
#     timing: especially during political instability (1911–1913; 1931–1934)
#     trait: Moderately high Neuroticism (56th percentile)
#   - consequence: Loss of independence, increased household burden, and transfer of
#       practical authority to his adult son; culminates in stroke death.
#     scene: After the winter fever he misplaces familiar objects, repeats the same
#       story, gets lost on short routes, and sometimes cannot follow multi-step instructions;
#       family restricts him from traveling alone.
#     timing: late life (1936–1943)
#     trait: Neurocognitive disorder/delirium sequelae (must be visible)
# number_of_children: '5'

# structured_incidents:
# - event: While working for wages around market towns in northern Xinjiang, he stopped
#     observing Kazakh Muslim practice and began attending a small Russian-speaking
#     Orthodox prayer circle, taking a Christian name for dealings with its members.
#   reasoning: We already have an atypical religious trajectory selected (non-Muslim
#     upbringing or significant conversion/apostasy), which implies a major religious
#     change at least once.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: mid-20s to early 30s (c. 1909–1915)
#   type: religious_change
# - event: On a trip to a weekly bazaar to look for carting work, he was beaten by armed
#     men who accused him of carrying messages for a rival faction and took his belt
#     knife and part of his pay.
#   reasoning: Frontier rural life plus travel/market contact and periods of unrest
#     made beatings/robbery-related assaults and serious fights fairly common over a
#     lifetime.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late 40s (c. 1931–1933)
#   type: physical_assault
# - event: During an argument over unpaid wages at a herding camp, he struck another
#     hired hand with a whip handle and joined a brief brawl before elders separated
#     the men.
#   reasoning: Given that perpetrator violence is confirmed, the most common subtype
#     is participation in serious fights/assaults (often alcohol-, dispute-, or war-related)
#     rather than homicide or sexual violence.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early to mid-30s (c. 1918–1922)
#   type: physical_assault_perp
# - event: After a severe winter fever he never fully recovered his memory and judgment,
#     becoming intermittently confused and needing others to supervise his work and
#     travel.
#   reasoning: A later-life neurocognitive condition implies an ongoing limitation for
#     years; additionally chronic respiratory or joint problems were common in hard
#     rural labor lives.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 50s until death (c. 1936–1943)
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: He spent months helping care for a close co-resident relative who became
#     bedbound after a sudden paralysis, arranging food, fuel, and help from neighbors
#     when the household was short of labor.
#   reasoning: Three-generation co-residence and limited institutional care make prolonged
#     home care for a sick spouse, child, or sibling plausible, especially with adult
#     children present.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late 40s to early 50s (c. 1933–1937)
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: He served part-time in a local militia detachment, standing night guard and
#     escorting livestock and grain requisitions along the road between settlements
#     when fighting threatened the area.
#   reasoning: Some rural men were drawn into militia/security roles during unrest,
#     but as a laborer (not a formal soldier) it is somewhat more likely he experienced
#     war as a civilian than as long-term enlisted service.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late 30s to early 40s (c. 1923–1928)
#   type: military_service
# - event: During a period of factional fighting, his family fled with their essentials
#     to relatives’ winter quarters and returned weeks later to find corrals damaged
#     and stores partly looted.
#   reasoning: Northern Xinjiang in the 1910s–1930s saw armed conflict, requisitioning,
#     flight, and localized occupation; a migrant within the region had substantial
#     chance of displacement or direct threat.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late 40s (c. 1932–1934)
#   type: civilian_war_exposure

Orazbay uly Serik was born on October 27, 1884, on the north side of the Tianshan near Hutubi in Dzungaria, where Qing officials governed through county yamen and local intermediaries and where Kazakh camps, farms, and market towns met each other along the same roads. His family spoke Kazakh at home and used rough northern Chinese for trading and official encounters. His father, Serik, herded sheep and horses and moved seasonally between grazing and winter shelter. Orazbay grew up in a joint household that included close kin under one cooking pot, with arguments settled by older men and most work decided by need rather than preference.

He was the second child, the first son. His older sister, Asylzat, was two years ahead of him. After Orazbay came a line of younger siblings: a sister in 1886, a brother Tolegen in 1888, another sister in 1890, a short-lived brother in 1892, and two more sisters in 1894 and 1897. Their mother, Nurgul, ran the household side of herding life—milking, boiling, drying curds, and keeping felt and clothing in repair. Orazbay learned early that the family’s work depended on women’s routines as much as men’s riding. In 1894 his two-year-old brother died after a brief illness during cold weather. The adults spoke about keeping children warm, about not letting them drink bad water, and about how quickly a small body could be lost. Orazbay carried that forward; he watched the younger ones with a sharp, anxious attention that made him quick to call for help.

As a boy he followed the men with the small stock, and he liked the days when someone had to go toward the market road. He talked easily, asked questions, and remembered who sold what and which yamen runner liked to be greeted first. When he was taught to recognize and copy Arabic-script lines from a small religious booklet, he practiced at night, tracing letters by lamplight, then folding the paper carefully as if it were a tool. He did not enjoy arguments about new ideas. If someone proposed a different route or a new bargain, he tested it against what elders had done before and pushed back if it felt unsteady.

When he was twenty-one, Asylzat died at twenty-four. That year also became the year he married. His wife was Ainagul, from a nearby kin network, and their marriage joined two households that already traded help at lambing and during hard winters. Orazbay treated the marriage as a working partnership. He liked small pleasures he could count on: a bowl of hot tea with milk after returning from the road, and the sound of someone in the camp singing while felt was being beaten and dried. He teased Ainagul when she corrected his counting, and she replied by sending him back out to check a knot twice.

Their first child, a son, was born a year after the marriage. A daughter followed three years later, and then another son two years after that. In those years Orazbay began taking more wage work around market towns and along the road toward Ürümqi. He drove carts when he could get the job, helped with herds that were not his own, and carried messages for employers who wanted someone who could speak a little Chinese and keep a straight account. He handled money carefully and returned borrowed gear quickly, even when others did not. He argued about fair weights and refused obvious cheating, which sometimes cost him an easy profit and sometimes earned him another day's work.

Around twenty-five he started spending time near a small Russian-speaking Orthodox prayer circle on the edge of town, first because work pulled him there and then because the group offered predictable help: a meal after a long day, a chance to sit inside, a place where a man could be addressed with calm respect. A lay leader they called Father Mikhail read from books Orazbay could not follow, but Orazbay listened and learned phrases. He stopped joining Muslim practice with his kin and began attending those gatherings instead. For dealings with the Russians he used the name Andrei. It served as a tool: it opened doors, reduced suspicion, and made it easier to ask for a favor without bowing and scraping. It also made some relatives wary. He did not seek arguments over it; he avoided long discussions and changed the topic to work.

The Qing fell when he was twenty-seven. For the next few years the names of officials changed and so did the tone of the yamen. Taxes and travel demands shifted, and rumors ran ahead of facts. Orazbay checked his tack repeatedly before leaving camp, and he kept his knife sharp. He did not enjoy the talk of new politics. He went where the work was and watched who carried rifles.

Ainagul delivered a daughter who lived only briefly when Orazbay was thirty. Two years later one of his younger sisters died at twenty-seven. Under the tightening control associated with Yang Zengxin's rule, Orazbay worked at a herding camp where a group of hired men waited for wages that came late. One afternoon at thirty-four the argument over pay turned into pushing and then striking. Orazbay grabbed a whip handle and hit Boranbay, another hired hand, across the shoulder and head. Several men piled in. Elders arrived fast, shouting and pulling them apart. Orazbay paid with a public apology and a small compensation agreed in front of witnesses. He returned to work with a stiff jaw and no interest in revisiting the matter.

His eldest son died at sixteen when Orazbay was thirty-nine. He buried the boy with the help of kin and then became harder to move with persuasion. The same year he took part-time militia duty. His literacy and his ability to speak some Chinese made him useful on escort work. For the next five years he stood night guard with a local detachment, walked the edges of camp with a rifle, and rode beside carts carrying grain or livestock requisitions along the road between settlements. He learned which commanders accepted gifts, which demanded strict obedience, and which could be talked down with careful words. He liked the order of guard shifts and the simple pride of being trusted to keep a watch list.

The family did not become wealthy. They stayed ordinary and stable. Ainagul and the children managed the home side; Orazbay moved between hired herding, carting, and militia tasks. Their youngest surviving daughter was born when he was thirty-three, and by the late 1920s she could fetch water and watch younger cousins. Their son Mukhtar, born when Orazbay was twenty-eight, grew into a steady worker and began to look like the next household head.

Trouble sharpened again in the early 1930s. Armed factions fought and banditry rose with the wider conflicts that reached Xinjiang. At forty-seven the family fled with what they could carry to relatives' winter quarters, relying on his surviving sister for shelter and introductions. They returned weeks later to find corrals broken and stores partly looted. The damage meant months of patching and borrowing.

The following year Orazbay rode to a weekly bazaar to look for carting work. Armed men seized him on the road, accusing him of carrying messages for rivals. They beat him with fists and sticks and took his belt knife and part of his pay. He came home with torn clothing and swollen ribs and insisted on walking into the yard without help. Ainagul cleaned him anyway, angry and efficient.

By fifty a close co-resident relative suffered a sudden paralysis and became bedbound. The household had fewer hands than before, and Orazbay took on the practical tasks: arranging fuel, finding someone to sit with the sick person while Ainagul worked, and asking neighbors for help without making it sound like begging. He visited often, bringing tea and speaking in a steady voice even when his own nerves ran tight. His adult children, especially the daughters, rotated through care, and Orazbay kept track of who had done what so the burden stayed shared.

In the winter when he was fifty-two he caught a severe fever. When it passed, something in him stayed altered. He repeated the same story in the same words, misplaced tools, and once walked a familiar short route and turned the wrong way, ending up cold and embarrassed at a neighbor's fence. Ainagul stopped letting him travel alone. Mukhtar, now grown, took over bargaining and payments. Orazbay still wanted to go out, to talk, to take the road, but he needed supervision and grew irritated when corrected.

As the war in the wider world tightened borders and changed market supplies, cloth, tea, and metal tools became harder to obtain, and prices jumped. The family relied more on what they could mend and make. Orazbay sat near the doorway, watching the yard and greeting visitors with the same warmth, then losing the thread of the conversation. Some days he wrote a few Arabic-script lines, slowly, to prove to himself he still could.

At fifty-eight he collapsed with a stroke in the three-generation household where his wife and Mukhtar's family lived under the same roof. He died that day.
