# - event: 1911 Xinhai Revolution and the transition from Qing to Republic in Xinjiang,
#     bringing administrative uncertainty, changing officials, and disrupted tax/justice
#     routines
#   timing: late 20s (1911–1913)
# - event: Yang Zengxin’s consolidation of Xinjiang (relative order but strong policing,

#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Stability and fewer risky ventures, but he is slower to adapt during
#       the 1930s turmoil and relies heavily on kin guidance.
#     scene: He prefers familiar routes, customary bargains, and established elders’
#       judgments; he distrusts new political slogans and avoids experimenting with
#       new herding/farming methods unless pressured.
#     timing: visible from adolescence through midlife (1898–1930)
#     trait: Low Openness (17th percentile)
#   - consequence: Improves access to wage work and militia placement; also increases
#       exposure to disputes and violence in public spaces.
#     scene: At bazaars and camps he is the talker and connector—negotiating small jobs,
#       mediating minor disputes, and building rapport with Chinese-speaking officials
#       or traders.
#     timing: strong in young adulthood and midlife (1904–1930)
#     trait: High Extraversion (81st percentile)
#   - consequence: Maintains 'ordinary respected' standing despite being a laborer;
#       becomes a default helper in caregiving and community obligations.
#     scene: He keeps careful verbal accounts, returns borrowed tack/tools promptly,
#       and refuses obvious scams or cheating weights even when others do it; he is
#       trusted with escorting goods.
#     timing: young adulthood onward (1906–1943)
#     trait: Very high Honesty-Humility (91st percentile)
#   - consequence: Prepares diligently and avoids some dangers, but contributes to irritability
#       that can flare during wage disputes.
#     scene: Under uncertainty (tax demands, rumors of fighting) he becomes tense and
#       vigilant, sleeps poorly, and repeatedly checks animals/gear before travel.
#     timing: especially during political instability (1911–1913; 1931–1934)
#     trait: Moderately high Neuroticism (56th percentile)
#   - consequence: Loss of independence, increased household burden, and transfer of
#       practical authority to his adult son; culminates in stroke death.
#     scene: After the winter fever he misplaces familiar objects, repeats the same
#       story, gets lost on short routes, and sometimes cannot follow multi-step instructions;
#       family restricts him from traveling alone.
#     timing: late life (1936–1943)
#     trait: Neurocognitive disorder/delirium sequelae (must be visible)
# number_of_children: '5'

# structured_incidents:
# - event: While working for wages around market towns in northern Xinjiang, he stopped
#     observing Kazakh Muslim practice and began attending a small Russian-speaking
#     Orthodox prayer circle, taking a Christian name for dealings with its members.
#   reasoning: We already have an atypical religious trajectory selected (non-Muslim
#     upbringing or significant conversion/apostasy), which implies a major religious
#     change at least once.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: mid-20s to early 30s (c. 1909–1915)
#   type: religious_change
# - event: On a trip to a weekly bazaar to look for carting work, he was beaten by armed
#     men who accused him of carrying messages for a rival faction and took his belt
#     knife and part of his pay.
#   reasoning: Frontier rural life plus travel/market contact and periods of unrest
#     made beatings/robbery-related assaults and serious fights fairly common over a
#     lifetime.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late 40s (c. 1931–1933)
#   type: physical_assault
# - event: During an argument over unpaid wages at a herding camp, he struck another
#     hired hand with a whip handle and joined a brief brawl before elders separated
#     the men.
#   reasoning: Given that perpetrator violence is confirmed, the most common subtype
#     is participation in serious fights/assaults (often alcohol-, dispute-, or war-related)
#     rather than homicide or sexual violence.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early to mid-30s (c. 1918–1922)
#   type: physical_assault_perp
# - event: After a severe winter fever he never fully recovered his memory and judgment,
#     becoming intermittently confused and needing others to supervise his work and
#     travel.
#   reasoning: A later-life neurocognitive condition implies an ongoing limitation for
#     years; additionally chronic respiratory or joint problems were common in hard
#     rural labor lives.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 50s until death (c. 1936–1943)
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: He spent months helping care for a close co-resident relative who became
#     bedbound after a sudden paralysis, arranging food, fuel, and help from neighbors
#     when the household was short of labor.
#   reasoning: Three-generation co-residence and limited institutional care make prolonged
#     home care for a sick spouse, child, or sibling plausible, especially with adult
#     children present.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late 40s to early 50s (c. 1933–1937)
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: He served part-time in a local militia detachment, standing night guard and
#     escorting livestock and grain requisitions along the road between settlements
#     when fighting threatened the area.
#   reasoning: Some rural men were drawn into militia/security roles during unrest,
#     but as a laborer (not a formal soldier) it is somewhat more likely he experienced
#     war as a civilian than as long-term enlisted service.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late 30s to early 40s (c. 1923–1928)
#   type: military_service
# - event: During a period of factional fighting, his family fled with their essentials
#     to relatives’ winter quarters and returned weeks later to find corrals damaged
#     and stores partly looted.
#   reasoning: Northern Xinjiang in the 1910s–1930s saw armed conflict, requisitioning,
#     flight, and localized occupation; a migrant within the region had substantial
#     chance of displacement or direct threat.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late 40s (c. 1932–1934)
#   type: civilian_war_exposure

Orazbay uly Serik was born on October 27, 1884, in the dry open country near Hutubi on the north side of the Tianshan. The Qing ruled Xinjiang through officials and local intermediaries, and Kazakh clans moved their herds through grazing circuits that crossed county lines and paperwork. His family spoke Kazakh at home and used a rough Northern Chinese with traders and yamen clerks when they had to.

He entered a crowded joint household. His father, Serik, kept sheep and a few horses and expected every child to work early. His mother, Nurgul, ran the domestic side: milking, boiling, sewing, and feeding whoever was in the cooking circle that day. Orazbay grew up with an older sister, Asylzat, then himself, then a string of younger siblings. The family counted losses plainly. In 1894, when Orazbay was nine, his little brother died at two after a brief sickness that left the child quiet and cold. After that winter, his mother stored fuel more carefully, and his father forced the boys to check the animals twice each night in the worst weather.

Orazbay talked easily. When caravans or herding camps gathered, he drifted toward the men who told stories and argued prices. He liked the salt tea his mother brewed thick and dark and took pride in bringing it to visitors without spilling. As a teenager he rode to market with older men, listening, repeating phrases in Chinese under his breath, and learning which officials wanted quick answers and which wanted silence. He learned to read and write simple Arabic script from an elder relative who copied prayers and short notes; Orazbay kept a small scrap of paper in his boot with a few lines he had practiced.

In 1906, Asylzat died at twenty-four. The household tightened. That same year Orazbay married Ainagul, a woman from kin connected through grazing rights. He built a separate hearth but stayed close enough that his mother could call for help and his father could demand it. Ainagul worked like his mother had: milking, drying curds, making felt, keeping a tight store of flour and tea. In 1907 their first child, a son, was born. Orazbay became louder about money and supplies, pressing for paid work when the household herd could not meet every need.

By 1909 he took wage jobs near the market towns, carting loads, herding for other men, and doing odd tasks that needed a quick tongue. He did not enjoy novelty, but he enjoyed steady routines: waking before others, checking a harness knot, counting coins twice, then walking into the bazaar with a straight back. In town he met Russian-speaking men linked to a small Orthodox prayer circle. He began showing up in the evenings, standing in the back, listening, and learning a few phrases. He stopped joining Muslim observance at home and avoided arguments about it by leaving early for work. For dealings with that circle he used the name Andrei. He kept it separate: Andrei in town, Orazbay at home. Ainagul noticed and asked directly. He answered directly too, then returned to his tea and bread without trying to persuade her.

A daughter was born in 1910. That year his younger brother Tolegen died at twenty-two, a strong young man gone quickly. Orazbay carried more of the load afterward and grew more impatient with anyone who did not finish a task. When news of the 1911 Revolution traveled to Xinjiang, it came as orders and rumors: new officials, new stamps, different demands at checkpoints. In 1912 Yang Zengxin consolidated his rule, and policing tightened. Guards asked more questions on the roads. Orazbay, who could answer in Chinese without stumbling, found that he was used as the spokesman when a group of men hauled goods together. He stuck to familiar routes and familiar companions, keeping his eyes down when uniformed men passed, then talking again once they were gone.

In 1912 Ainagul bore a second son, Mukhtar. In 1915 a baby girl died at birth, and Ainagul went quiet for days. Orazbay washed his hands more often after that, scalding them in hot water until his skin cracked. In 1917 his younger sister died at twenty-seven. That year Ainagul had another daughter, and the house filled again with the sounds of children and the hard work of keeping them fed.

In 1919, at a herding camp where Orazbay worked for wages, the pay came late. The man who owed it laughed and promised tomorrow. Another hired hand, Boranbay, pushed for payment. The argument turned into grabbing and shoving. Orazbay struck Boranbay with a whip handle and joined the brawl until elders dragged them apart. The elders forced compensation in livestock and demanded an apology. Orazbay gave it without theatrics. He went home angry at himself for losing control, and he became stricter about written notes and witnesses when money was involved.

In 1923 his oldest son died at sixteen after a short illness that started with a cough and ended with the boy too weak to stand. Orazbay dug the grave with his hands raw from the spade handle. That year he agreed to serve in a local militia detachment that guarded roads and escorted requisitions. He stood night watch with an old rifle and a heavy coat that smelled of smoke. He walked alongside carts of grain, listening for hooves in the dark. He drank tea with the guard captain, a Chinese-speaking man named Zhang Shouyi, and traded small favors: a warning about a checkpoint, a note about which road was safe.

By 1928, with Yang Zengxin dead and new power struggles rising, Orazbay stepped back from regular militia duty. He returned to hired labor and carting. He remained ordinary in standing: not poor enough to beg, not rich enough to hire. He took satisfaction in small things: a well-tied load, a horse that stood calmly, the sound of his wife and daughters laughing with his sisters during visits. He teased Mukhtar when the boy tried to act older than he was, then handed him a real task and watched closely until it was done.

In 1932 the fighting and banditry tied to the wider Xinjiang conflicts reached their area in waves. One week the bazaar ran; the next week it emptied. That year Orazbay and Ainagul fled with essentials to a relative’s winter quarters, joining his surviving sister, the one born in 1886, and her family. They returned weeks later to find corrals broken and stores partly looted. In 1933, traveling to a weekly bazaar to look for carting work, Orazbay was stopped by armed men who accused him of carrying messages for a rival faction. They beat him, took his belt knife, and stripped part of his pay from his pouch. He came home with bruised ribs and a cut lip, speaking little for days.

In 1935 a close co-resident relative—an older man from the joint family—suffered sudden paralysis and became bedbound. Orazbay arranged fuel, fetched water, and went house to house asking for help when the household fell short. Ainagul managed the meals; Orazbay managed the favors, the borrowing, and the turn-taking. He wrote short notes in Arabic script to keep track of who had brought flour and who had promised a sheep. He did not let the list turn into a public accusation; he used it to repay quietly.

In the winter of 1936 he fell ill with a fever that left him sweating and delirious. He survived, but the man who stood up afterward did not hold the same mind. He repeated questions, forgot where he set tools, and once walked a familiar short route and ended up at the wrong encampment. Ainagul stopped letting him go alone. Mukhtar, now an adult, began to take the lead. In 1939, when wartime pressures tightened borders and goods became scarce, Mukhtar handled the bargaining for cloth and metal. Orazbay sat near the stove, turning prayer papers in his hands, sometimes calling himself Andrei without noticing.

On March 12, 1943, in a three-generation household with Mukhtar and his family under the same roof, Orazbay collapsed with a stroke and died that day.
