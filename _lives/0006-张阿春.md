Zhang Achun was born in midwinter in 808, in the low wet country south of the Yangzi, where paddies sat between wooded ridges and narrow dikes. Her family held good land and collected rent grain from tenant plots. Her father kept a teaching room off the main hall. Boys came to recite; he corrected their strokes, then stayed up copying out classics for the examinations that could bring an appointment. Her mother ran the stores and servants and kept the household rites on their days.

The birth did not happen at home. Achun’s mother went to a small shrine compound a few li away, a place the Zhangs supplied with grain and repairs. A midwife lived there. When the pains turned hard, a healer from an upland hamlet was called in and the shrine steward hovered in the yard, watching the servants and counting what was used.

Inside, women moved between the local speech and the upland tongue. When the steward stepped close, they answered him in short phrases and then turned their faces away and spoke over his head. At the bedside they burned incense and bowed toward the family tablets, and they tied a strip of cloth to the old tree by the gate and asked the ground spirit to keep the threshold clear.

Before dawn on January 14, the child came at last. The labor had dragged and the room smelled of sweat and smoke. When the midwife drew her out, she did not cry. Her skin stayed dark and her breath came thin and uneven. They rubbed her hard with warm cloths and pressed her back and feet to bring her around. A servant ran to fetch her father from the main house.

For four days the baby lived, quiet and difficult to rouse. She took little, slept without settling, and startled only when a hand touched her chest. On January 18, in the same room at the shrine compound, her breathing thinned and stopped while the incense hung low under the rafters.
