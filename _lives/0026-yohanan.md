Yohanan was born in the limestone hill country inland from Antioch, where small villages sat between stony terraces and patches of deeper soil. His family lived in a one-room house of cut stone with a yard shared by baskets, a tether post, and the donkey. Beyond the wall lay the land worked for the estate: grain on the flatter ground, olives and vines where the earth ran thin.

Aramaic filled the house. The family belonged to a local notable through the estate’s steward, who counted what was owed and what had been worked, and who took his share when the grain was threshed. Yohanan’s father earned most of their standing by moving other people’s goods. He walked the tracks to market towns beside a loaded animal, carrying sacks of barley or skins of oil, and came home with dust ground into his legs.

That summer the road changed. Patrols moved through more often, and men at the road posts stopped carts and pack trains to look for proof of ownership and payment. They pressed fingers into wax and stared at knots and stoppers, then demanded coin or a portion from the load before letting anyone pass. One evening Yohanan’s father returned late after an argument over a jar that had been opened and resealed. He set the load down hard, spoke little, and ate in silence.

Yohanan’s mother spun and worked the loom when she could. When the overseer called, she joined the other women in the fields to weed, glean, and carry sheaves. She tied an amulet into the infant’s swaddling and, at the village shrine, left oil and a pinch of incense with a vow for his health. Two sons were already gone from the house, one buried at eight years and one at two. No one recited their names over the cradle, but she watched Yohanan’s skin and breathing each time she woke.

In mid-July the heat held through the night. Water stood too long in the clay jar and took on a sharp taste. Yohanan began to pass thin stool. He stopped taking the breast, then could not keep his mouth wet. His cry weakened until it was only a strained sound. His hands and feet cooled and his limbs slackened.

On July 20, 135, before the sun cleared the courtyard wall, he stopped moving.
