#     death_age: 27
#     death_year: -1605
#     narrative_role: Only son; his labor is crucial to Səm’s security. His death triggers
#       deeper economic vulnerability and worsens depressive symptoms.
#     sex: M
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 25
#     connection: Occurs during early married years amid poor rains; raid intensifies
#       household scarcity and fuels marital conflict and later suspicion toward outsiders.
#     incident: civilian_war_exposure
#   - age: 34
#     connection: Caregiving for an affine increases her workload and resentment toward
#       husband’s kin; contributes to emotional exhaustion and depressive persistence.
#     incident: sick_relative
#   - age: 42
#     connection: Theft during lean season directly worsens household food security;
#       her accusatory, low-agreeableness response damages relations with neighbors/affines.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 48
#     connection: Follows years of winter smoke exposure and repeated respiratory infections;
#       reduced capacity pushes her toward dependence and makes abandonment more likely
#       to become permanent.
#     incident: chronic_illness
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-7
#     key_events:
#     - Born in a widowed/abandoned-parent household; mother runs a small subsistence
#       holding with help from older sister.
#     - Early exposure to hunger seasons and storage losses; learns food processing,
#       gleaning, and watching stores.
#     - Temper shows early in sibling conflicts and in refusal to accept scolding from
#       elders.
#     phase: Early childhood (father-absent, poor natal home)
#   - age_range: 8-17
#     key_events:
#     - Takes on heavier farm and service labor as mother ages; household remains poor.
#     - Arranged betrothal negotiations with a nearby settlement; she resists but has
#       little leverage.
#     - 'Shows high curiosity/openness: interest in unfamiliar tools/ritual talk/travelers’
#       stories, despite limited schooling.'
#     phase: Later childhood & adolescence (work socialization, marriage arrangement)
#   - age_range: 18-30
#     key_events:
#     - Moves to husband’s settlement (~5–20 km) and integrates into affinal household
#       labor; relationship marked by quarrels and stubbornness.
#     - 'Civilian war exposure: raid prompts flight with kin to reeds/woodland; return
#       to damaged fields and stolen stores.'
#     - Birth and raising of only son; periods of poor rains increase reliance on service
#       labor.
#     phase: Early adult married life (patrilocal move, conflict, raid)
#   - age_range: 31-45
#     key_events:
#     - 'Major caregiving: prolonged nursing of an affine with wasting fever until death
#       (household stress and ritual obligations).'
#     - Older sister dies (Səm loses a natal ally; grief adds to depressive episodes).
#     - 'Victim of property crime: storehouse theft during a late-winter lean period;
#       increases mistrust and household conflict.'
#     phase: Midlife (caregiving obligations, sister’s death, theft, deepening strain)
#   - age_range: 46-62
#     key_events:
#     - Chronic chest illness begins (recurrent winter cough progressing to breathlessness),
#       limiting heavy labor.
#     - Only son dies at 27; social protection and food security deteriorate further.
#     - De facto separation/abandonment solidifies; she ends life as a dependent in
#       an extended-kin household, dying after an acute respiratory infection.

#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Reputation for harsh speech; weaker reciprocal aid in later hardship
#       and greater tolerance for her eventual marginalization/separation.
#     scene: Public quarrel over grain measures or labor allocation; she openly accuses
#       a neighbor/affine of cheating and refuses the usual conciliatory gift/gesture.
#     timing: midlife (ages 35-45), especially around the storehouse theft at ~42
#     trait: Very low agreeableness (1st percentile)
#   - consequence: Sometimes improves household output or coping strategies, but also
#       draws criticism for being 'restless' or not following custom.
#     scene: She seeks out travelers/ritual specialists for explanations of unusual
#       omens and experiments with unfamiliar weaving patterns or new ways to store
#       grain against damp/rodents.
#     timing: adolescence through early adulthood (ages 12-30)
#     trait: High openness (91st percentile)
#   - consequence: Occasional preventable losses (spoilage, missed planting windows)
#       that compound poverty and household conflict.
#     scene: She procrastinates on routine maintenance (patching roofs, resealing storage
#       jars) until pressured, then works in intense bursts; chores slip during depressive
#       lows.
#     timing: throughout adulthood, more visible after age 40
#     trait: Low conscientiousness (27th percentile)
#   - consequence: Reduced work capacity and social participation; increases dependence
#       on kin and heightens marital/affinal tensions that culminate in de facto abandonment.
#     scene: Weeks-long periods of slowed movement, withdrawal from communal talk, sleep
#       disruption, and a sense of hopelessness, especially after sister’s death and
#       later after her son’s death.
#     timing: recurrent from early adulthood; pronounced episodes ages 33-36, 42-45,
#       and after son’s death (post -1605)
#     trait: Depressive disorder (recurrent/persistent, impairing)
#   - consequence: Gets worse terms in exchanges and obligations, reinforcing poverty;
#       contributes to suspiciousness and accusatory conflicts.
#     scene: She struggles with complex bargaining/reciprocity accounting and is more
#       easily outmaneuvered in disputes over shares, though she is competent at repetitive
#       practical tasks.
#     timing: early adulthood into midlife (ages 18-45)
#     trait: Lower intelligence (27th percentile) in an oral, practical setting

# - event: During a late-winter lean period, someone slipped into the yard storehouse
#     at night and stole a small basket of millet and a coil of spun hemp thread she
#     had been saving to barter, leaving the latch forced.
#   reasoning: Small-scale theft of stored grain, tools, or cloth was common in agrarian
#     villages and during lean seasons; as a poor dependent she had limited ability
#     to protect belongings but also fewer valuables to target.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 41–43
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: After repeated winters of coughing, she developed a long-lasting chest illness
#     with breathlessness and fatigue that flared badly in cold months and limited how
#     long she could work in the fields or carry loads.
#   reasoning: Long-term conditions (chronic respiratory disease from smoke, joint degeneration,
#     recurrent infections, gynecological issues) were frequent in older agrarian adults
#     and fit her survival to 62 with ongoing limitation.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: onset age 46–49; persisted to death
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: She spent months tending an affine (a relative by marriage) with a wasting
#     fever—preparing thin millet gruel, keeping the hearth going, cleaning bedding,
#     and fetching water—until the person died.
#   reasoning: In kin households without institutional care, women commonly nursed relatives
#     through long illnesses; her later life in extended-kin residence suggests reciprocal
#     obligations that often include such care.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 33–35
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: When armed men from a nearby polity raided the area for grain and captives,
#     she fled with kin to reed beds and woodland for several days, returning to find
#     fields trampled and stored millet taken.
#   reasoning: Local raids/feuding and Shang-era coercion could force temporary flight,
#     requisitioning, or living near armed activity; this is the most typical way a
#     rural woman would experience warfare directly.
#   tier: 2

Səm was born in 1650 BC in the low, flat country of southwest Shandong, where millet fields ran out from small hamlets and the Yellow River’s broad plain shaped everyone’s work. Local lineages controlled land and labor, and the larger Shang world pressed in through tribute demands, raids, and the movement of bronze goods and ritual practices. Səm spoke the local Sinitic tongue and grew up with household offerings to ancestors and small rites to the earth and water at planting and harvest.

Her father was absent from the household from the day she was born. Her mother, Məj, ran the cooking fire and the storage jars and took whatever fieldwork she could manage. Səm’s sister, Ləw, born in 1653 BC, was already a strong, sharp child who could carry water and watch a pot without letting it boil dry. When Səm was small, she spent long mornings at the edge of the fields picking up dropped millet heads and pulling weeds. In the late summer, when locusts came in scattered waves and stripped patches of green, the two girls moved through the stubble collecting what remained, their hands sticky with chaff.

Səm’s temper showed early. When other children took fruit from the hedges or tried to push past her at the water place, she shoved back and shouted until older women separated them. Her mother dragged her home by the wrist more than once, and Səm pulled away hard enough to leave red marks. She did not soften for neighbors. She did not lower her voice. People learned to leave her alone and to keep their own children away from her.

At the same time she watched everything. When an older man came from another settlement with news about a new ditch cut for water control, she sat close enough to listen while she twisted hemp fibers. She stared at bronze tools when she saw them, turning them in her mind, then asked sharp questions that made adults snap at her to stop talking. She remembered details and tried small changes. She lined a storage jar with dried leaves to keep damp from climbing into the grain, then argued when her mother said the leaves were wasted.

By 1635 BC, Səm was fifteen and already doing service labor for other households when the crops failed. That summer the rains thinned out. Millet heads formed small and light. Məj sent her daughter to weed and harvest for a wealthier household in exchange for a sack of grain and a strip of cloth. Səm returned with cracked hands and a foul mood, and she counted the grain measure twice in front of the giver, loud enough for everyone to hear.

In 1634 BC, at sixteen, she married a man named Kraʔ from a settlement a short walk away. The match was arranged by older kin, and Səm left her mother’s house with a bundle of clothing and a few tools. She moved into Kraʔ’s household and worked under his mother’s eye. Səm did the grinding and carried manure to the plots. She spun hemp thread and kept it in coils, tight and clean, because thread traded well in lean months. She liked the early morning before others rose, when she could sit by the doorway with a cup of warm millet drink and twist fiber without hearing anyone’s orders. She also liked the first crisp days after harvest, when she could roast millet cakes on the edge of the fire and eat them outside with salt, watching smoke drift from other roofs.

In 1632 BC, her son Nəm was born. Səm labored at home with women from the household, then rose the next day and insisted on doing small tasks, refusing to stay on the sleeping mat. Her mother-in-law scolded her, and Səm snapped back. After that, the household settled into a pattern: work, arguments, quick silences, work again. Kraʔ wanted peace in his yard and tried to avoid her sharpness. Səm pressed him instead. She demanded more grain for her own pot, demanded that he confront neighbors who cut across their field edge, demanded that he stop laughing with other men while she carried water.

In 1625 BC, when Səm was twenty-five, armed men from a nearby polity struck the area. Word came at dusk, and the yard filled with shouting. Səm grabbed Nəm and a small bag of grain. Kraʔ’s kin drove pigs out of their pen and pushed them toward the reeds. Səm ran with the others into low woodland and stayed there for days. They drank from muddy water and ate sparingly. When they returned, the standing millet was trampled. The store had been opened and emptied. A neighbor’s house had burned. Səm walked through her own yard, took in the broken fence and the scattered ash, and began yelling names, accusing people in the open. Kraʔ dragged her away before older men answered back.

The next years were tight. A run of poor rains returned in 1621 BC, and grain grew expensive. Səm worked other people’s fields, bent over from dawn until the sun was high, then came home to grind and cook. She began to have stretches when she sat too long by the fire, hands idle, staring into the ash. When Kraʔ told her to move, she moved, but slowly, as if her body fought each step. She did not explain herself. She pushed Nəm hard instead, scolding him for every mistake, then falling silent for days.

In 1616 BC, at thirty-four, Səm took on months of caregiving for Kraʔ’s affine, a man named Tse, who lay with a wasting fever. She boiled thin millet gruel and fed him with a spoon carved from wood. She cleaned vomit from mats and kept the hearth going through cold nights. She walked to fetch water even when her legs shook with fatigue. When Tse spoke nonsense in the dark, she answered him sharply, then later sat outside the door, shoulders slumped, listening to dogs and distant coughing. Tse died in the same year, and the household performed rites and offerings. Səm did the work and did not accept thanks.

In 1619 BC, news came that her sister Ləw was dead. Ləw had lived in another household by then, and the message arrived through kin. Səm went to the funeral, brought a coil of thread, and watched the burial without tears. She returned and did not speak for days. Then she erupted into arguments over small things: the placement of a jar, a missing knife, a child’s footprints near the storage area. Kraʔ began sleeping away from her more often.

In 1608 BC, when Səm was forty-two, someone slipped into the yard storehouse during a late-winter lean period. In the morning she found the latch forced. A small basket of millet was gone. So was a coil of spun hemp thread she had kept for barter. She marched to the neighbors and accused a young man she disliked, naming him in front of his mother. The household elders intervened, and she refused their attempt to settle the matter quietly. The theft was never admitted. After that, doors were barred earlier, and people spoke to her with guarded faces.

By 1610 BC, Kraʔ had left the household in all but name. He spent nights elsewhere and stopped bringing grain to her pot. Səm continued working—fields when she could, service labor when she had to—leaning on her son as he grew into a strong worker. In 1605 BC, Nəm died at twenty-seven, struck down after a short illness that moved through the settlement in the cold season. Səm performed the rites demanded of her and then stopped caring for many things. She missed a planting window in the next cycle, and the household blamed her. She answered with curses and slammed a jar hard enough to crack it.

In 1602 BC, repeated winters of coughing turned into a lasting chest sickness. She coughed in the mornings until her ribs hurt. She grew breathless carrying water and had to rest halfway. Cold air made her cough worse. She still worked, but in bursts, and then sat hunched near the doorway, watching others move. She argued even when she could not catch her breath, cutting words short to cough and spit.

In 1595 BC, she left Kraʔ’s yard for good and moved into the household of Kwaʔ, a more distant affine who took her in because kin obligations could not be ignored. She worked what she could: sorting chaff, minding small children, stripping hemp, tending the fire. Some evenings, she told the younger women odd stories she had collected over the years—how a man from far away shaped a new kind of tool, how reeds could hide a whole family if they stayed quiet. They laughed at her blunt phrasing, and once, surprisingly, she laughed too, a short bark, then stopped and looked away.

In the spring of 1588 BC, a respiratory illness moved through the household. Səm’s cough turned wet and constant. She could not keep up with even small tasks. Kwaʔ’s wife set warm water near her and placed gruel by her hand. On April 29, 1588 BC, Səm died in that house, sixty-two years old. Her kin prepared the body, made offerings, and buried her in the ground outside the settlement.
