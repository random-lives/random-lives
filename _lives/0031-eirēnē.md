Eirēnē was born in the upland farms above the plain of Smyrna, in the Roman province of Asia, where Greek speech and village cults shaped daily life under imperial taxation and city markets. Her father, Menedēmos, held a small plot of grain and legumes, with a few vines close to the house and a kitchen garden her mother, Philonis, kept watered. A clay lamp burned at the hearth niche, and Philonis set pinches of barley and a splash of wine there for Hestia before the day’s grinding and baking.

Two boys had come before. Philōn had lived only long enough to be wrapped and laid out. The oldest, Dionysios, was already a grown man with a beard and rough hands. He took the donkey out to the fields at dawn and brought news back from the track that ran toward Smyrna’s market.

Philonis nursed Eirēnē through the spring and into the heat. When the time came to mix gruel, she mashed grain with water kept in a jar sunk into the cool earth. The child crawled on the packed floor while Philonis spun wool; Dionysios lifted her once, then set her down and returned to the threshing.

Dionysios died during the same year, and Menedēmos brought the farm in with hired help and a neighbor, Agathōn. In the winter after that, Eirēnē’s belly loosened and she passed watery stool through the day. Philonis tried boiled water and a little salted broth. The child died the next morning.

They washed her, rubbed her with oil, and wrapped her in cloth. Menedēmos carried her to a small grave near the settlement’s edge and set a few grains and a coin beside her before covering the earth.
