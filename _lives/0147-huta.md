#     detail: While her mother strains warm milk into a cloth, Huta squats nearby and
#       points, carefully repeating the household words for goat, lamb, and dog. She
#       tries to imitate the adult motions—holding a small bowl steady—then looks up

#     moment: Naming the animals and insisting on ‘helping’
#   - age: about 2 years
#     detail: On a hot day she toddles toward the water storage jar, drawn by the sound
#       of sloshing. She taps the clay with her fingers and leans in too far; a caretaker
#       catches her by the tunic. She startles, then steadies quickly and returns to
#       watching, unusually calm after the fright.

Huta was born in a small farmstead in the dry flats of Bactria, north of Balkh, when the land still sat under Hellenistic rule and its taxes, road patrols, and market towns. Her parents, Vardana and Roxana, spoke an Eastern Iranian tongue at home and kept the household rites: a clean hearth, measured offerings, and prayers to Ahura Mazda and Mithra with help from Atura, a priest who traveled between scattered villages.

Vardana divided his days between a patch of grain and legumes and the family’s sheep and goats. Roxana handled the milk. The work kept Huta close to the pens and the dairy cloth. When she could stand steadily, she followed her mother to the shaded side of the house where the morning milk was poured through a cloth into a bowl. Huta squatted beside it and pointed, repeating the words she heard each day—goat, lamb, dog—then reached out to hold the bowl with both hands. She watched her own grip, adjusted it, and waited until Roxana glanced down before she let go.

After Huta’s second winter, Roxana carried a new baby, Artuna, and nursed her while moving between the hearth and the milk jars. Huta brought small things without being asked: a clean cloth, a stick to prod the dung-cakes so they dried evenly. She kept her place beside the water jar too. On a hot afternoon she walked to it, drawn by the slosh, and leaned in to touch the damp rim. Roxana caught her tunic and pulled her back. Huta startled once, then crouched and tapped the clay again, watching the water move.

Three days after her second birthday, Huta developed sudden diarrhea. By the next morning her mouth was dry and she could not keep water down. Atura came, recited prayers, and Roxana set out a small offering of milk and grain by the hearth, but the child died before sunset. Vardana wrapped her in cloth and buried her in the ground beyond the house, placing a pinch of grain beside her and covering the spot with stones.
