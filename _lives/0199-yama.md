#     name: Ruma
#     narrative_role: Primary caregiver and skilled mixed forager (traps, occasional
#       fishing); affectionate but often exhausted. She buffers Yama from the father’s
#       harshness when she can, teaches her practical camp management, and dies when
#       Yama is a grown woman with children (loss that heightens Yama’s anxiety and
#       pushes her into a more central organizing role).
#     role: mother

#     name: Hanu
#     narrative_role: Generalist hunter-fisher-forager; respected outwardly and tied
#       to the household’s influence, but volatile during scarcity. He is the most likely
#       source of the recurring childhood beatings/withholding; in adulthood the relationship
#       becomes formal and careful—Yama manages him socially, avoids provoking him,
#       and uses kin ties to protect her own children.

#     name: Tala
#     narrative_role: First child; her short life is dominated by illness and care.
#       Yama’s early motherhood is shaped by constant vigilance, remedies, and sleepless
#       nights; Tala’s death becomes an enduring grief trigger.

#     name: Tomi
#     narrative_role: Son who survives to late adolescence/young adulthood; trained
#       in fishing and river travel. He is protective of Yama, sometimes impatient with
#       her anxious caution; his death (after Yama’s own death) foreshadows the family’s

#     name: Nari
#     narrative_role: Newborn son who dies at birth or within days; his death is tightly
#       linked to Yama’s fatal postpartum complication and is a central hinge-point
#       for the household.
#     sex: M
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 4
#     connection: Begins during a run of lean seasons and difficult moves; reinforces
#       Yama’s lifelong hypervigilance and people-pleasing, and explains her later tendency
#       to manage conflict indirectly rather than confront it.
#     incident: childhood_abuse
#   - age: 9
#     connection: Tapers as she becomes competent/useful and better able to anticipate
#       the father’s triggers; she shifts from being punished to being a mediator who
#       tries to keep her brother quiet and safe.
#     incident: childhood_abuse
#   - age: 27
#     connection: Links to her adult role in resource negotiation; the incident increases
#       her anxiety about inter-group meetings and pushes her toward more elaborate
#       reconciliation rituals and controlled distribution of food gifts.
#     incident: physical_assault
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-5
#     key_events:
#     - Born in late summer (-6805) into a well-regarded nuclear household within a
#       coastal-linked forager network; frequent seasonal moves between river corridors
#       and richer collecting areas.
#     - Learns early to be socially attentive—watching adults’ moods and anticipating
#       needs; begins helping with carrying kindling and watching younger children in
#       camp.
#     - Scarcity seasons begin to mark her childhood with fear of making noise or slowing
#       the group during travel.
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 6-15
#     key_events:
#     - Becomes a talkative, socially central child (storytelling, singing, keeping
#       peers together) while also being highly anxious and vigilant about danger and
#       disapproval.
#     - Takes on a 'second mother' role with her younger brother Kenu during moves and
#       when adults argue; learns practical routines (food division, tool checking,
#       water/fuel management).
#     - Around mid-teens, begins participating in longer foraging trips and inter-camp
#       visits where pair-bonds often begin forming.
#     phase: Later childhood and adolescence
#   - age_range: 16-26
#     key_events:
#     - Enters pair-bond with Senu (~-6789), likely moving within the same local territory;
#       becomes known for smoothing disputes and organizing cooperative tasks.
#     - First birth (~-6787) followed by caregiving-intensive years and the death of
#       her first child Tala (~-6785), shaping a lasting pattern of grief and heightened
#       protective behavior.
#     - Two more births (~-6784 Tomi; ~-6781 Mina). Yama’s household gains a reputation
#       for dependable sharing and hosting visiting kin.
#     phase: Early adulthood
#   - age_range: 27-38
#     key_events:
#     - Age 27 physical assault at a tense riverside negotiation with a neighboring
#       camp; afterward, Yama works to prevent escalation through gift-giving and careful
#       diplomacy while privately remaining shaken.
#     - Death of her mother Ruma (~-6778) leads Yama to absorb more caregiving and organizational
#       duties; she becomes a key distributor of food and coordinator of childcare in
#       her camp cluster.
#     - Father Hanu dies (~-6772), removing a feared presence but also a provider; alliances
#       and sharing obligations intensify. Final pregnancy culminates in a fatal childbirth/postpartum
#       complication in -6767 alongside the death of the newborn.
#     phase: Mid-adulthood
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Kiri
#     prominence: intermittent from Yama’s teens; central in ages 27-38
#     relationship: Older woman/shamanic healer in Yama’s camp network; oversees divination
#       and postpartum rituals, provides counsel after the age-27 assault and during
#       later pregnancies.
#   - name: Pira
#     prominence: peaks at age 27 and resurfaces during later inter-camp meetings (ages
#       28-32)
#     relationship: Woman from the neighboring camp involved in the age-27 assault (the
#       one who strikes Yama); later becomes a tense counterpart in negotiations and
#       reconciliation exchanges.
#   - name: Lina
#     prominence: ages 12-38
#     relationship: Yama’s close age-mate and cooperative foraging partner; helps with
#       childcare and shares processing work, sometimes gently challenging Yama’s anxious
#       caution.
#   partners:
#   - name: Senu
#     narrative_role: Co-resident long-term partner (socially recognized pair-bond).
#       Generally reliable and cooperative, but not dominant; he values Yama’s social
#       skill and organizational labor. Their bond is tested by child deaths and inter-group
#       tension; he is present during the final birth and becomes a widower responsible
#       for surviving children.
#     relationship_end_year: -6767
#     relationship_start_year: -6789
#   siblings:
#   - birth_year: -6803
#     death_age: 61
#     death_year: -6742
#     name: Kenu
#     narrative_role: Younger brother who grows up in Yama’s shadow; as children he
#       is sometimes shielded by her during their father’s rages, and as adults he becomes
#       a steady ally in camp politics and a helper/provider for her children after
#       crises.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds broad alliance ties that raise her adult standing and make
#       her a default organizer; also increases exposure to conflict and to the age-27
#       assault setting.
#     scene: 'She naturally gathers people: calling for cooperative shellfish collecting,
#       leading songs while traveling, and acting as the first to greet visitors and
#       set a friendly tone at shared hearths.'
#     timing: visible from ages 6-38, especially during inter-camp visits and communal
#       work
#     trait: Extraversion (very high)
#   - consequence: Earns trust and influence in food distribution/childcare coordination;
#       also makes her vulnerable to being pushed around by harsher personalities and
#       to internalizing resentment/fear.
#     scene: She gives away prized shares, offers apologies quickly, and steps between
#       disputants—often taking blame onto herself to stop escalation.
#     timing: ages 10-38, strongest after she becomes a mother
#     trait: Agreeableness (very high)
#   - consequence: Drives meticulous risk-avoidance behaviors and over-preparation;
#       can strain relationships (others see her as 'too worried'), but also prevents
#       accidents and improves readiness.
#     scene: 'Constant scanning for danger and social disapproval: waking at night to
#       check the fire and children, rehearsing worst-case outcomes before travel, flinching
#       at raised voices (especially male anger).'
#     timing: begins ages 4-9 during abuse; persists through adulthood with peaks after
#       child illness/deaths and after the age-27 assault
#     trait: Neuroticism (very high) without clear disorder
#   - consequence: Stabilizes camp routines and reduces risky experimentation; may create
#       friction with more novelty-seeking peers/visitors.
#     scene: Prefers tried-and-true routes, familiar remedies, and inherited ways of
#       dividing food; skeptical of novel tools/ritual innovations unless endorsed by
#       respected elders.
#     timing: mostly adulthood (ages 16-38) when decisions matter
#     trait: Openness (low)
#   - consequence: Improves her effectiveness as a camp manager and mediator; can seed
#       quiet suspicion among rivals if noticed.
#     scene: While generous face-to-face, she is capable of strategic self-presentation—downplaying
#       her household’s stores, subtly steering gifts to secure alliances, and using
#       flattery to influence decisions.
#     timing: ages 18-38
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (low-moderate)
#   - consequence: Leads her to rely on social cooperation and experienced mentors;
#       reinforces her preference for tradition and her strength in people-management
#       rather than technical innovation.
#     scene: 'Slow with abstract planning and unfamiliar problem-solving (e.g., new
#       net layouts), but competent in learned routines: counting out shares by habit,
#       remembering who owes whom, and organizing work by social roles.'
#     timing: childhood learning and early adulthood skill acquisition (ages 8-25)
#     trait: Intelligence (low)
#   - consequence: Contributes to her avoidance of direct fights and to reliance on
#       coalition-building; increases vulnerability in the age-27 assault scenario.
#     scene: Given heavy loads last, teased when young, and sometimes physically overpowered
#       in disputes; compensates by staying close to allies and using voice/social presence
#       rather than force.
#     timing: most visible ages 6-38, especially in confrontations and travel
#     trait: Very short stature
# number_of_children: '4'
# number_of_siblings: '1'
# occupation: All-around forager and camp manager (organizing daily work, childcare
#   coordination, food distribution within kin network)
# religion: Shamanic healing/divination rites led by a ritual specialist (trance, drumming/dance,
#   spirit negotiation for illness/misfortune)
# sibling_ages_at_death:
# - 61
# sibling_sexes:
# - M
# structured_incidents:
# - event: 'This was a recurring pattern: during seasons of scarcity and frequent camp
#     moves, one caretaker—most plausibly her father—used harsh beatings and occasional
#     food-withholding to force obedience and silence when she cried or lagged while
#     being carried and later while gathering near camp. The abuse was framed as “making
#     her tough” and keeping her from attracting danger, but left her fearful and watchful
#     around adults.'
#   reasoning: In small forager households, harsh physical discipline and occasional
#     neglect can occur, but her birth household was stable (two co-resident parents)
#     and well-regarded, which lowers the chance of severe, repeated abuse.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 4–9
#   type: childhood_abuse
# - event: 'This was a single event: at a tense riverside meeting with a neighboring
#     camp to negotiate access to a productive fishing/collecting spot, an argument
#     over a basket of dried fish and shellfish escalated and a woman from the other
#     group struck her with a digging stick/club, knocking her down and leaving her
#     bloodied and bruised before others pulled them apart.'
#   reasoning: Non-domestic fights and attacks (within the band or during inter-group
#     tensions) are plausible in a life involving resource disputes and travel; her
#     extraversion increases social exposure, raising the chance of at least one serious
#     incident.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 27
#   type: physical_assault

Yama was born in late summer to a small camp that moved between wooded ridges and river flats in the warm country that later generations would call the south. Her people belonged to a coastal-linked forager network, tied to other camps by marriage, visits, and traded stone and shell. There were no chiefs with guards or storehouses that lasted for years. Influence came from who could feed others, settle quarrels, and keep relatives close. Spirits mattered in daily decisions: river places that took lives, old trees that were avoided, and the dead who still had names and tempers. When illness or bad luck would not lift, Kiri, an older woman who beat a skin drum and breathed smoke over people’s heads, spoke for what could not be seen.

Yama’s mother, Ruma, carried her on long moves and set traps along small streams. Ruma fished too, kneeling in shallow water with a woven basket while other women drove fish toward it. Yama’s father, Hanu, moved between hunting and fishing, and he came home with meat often enough that his household held standing in camp. He also kept a quick temper. Yama grew into a very small child—short-legged, easily knocked sideways when older children ran through camp—and she learned to keep close to the fire and to watch faces.

When Yama was four, a lean season came early. The group left a familiar bend of river before the nuts were ready, then moved again when the fish runs failed. Hanu hit her when she cried during the night and woke others. He struck with an open hand and sometimes with a stick he used for driving dogs away from drying racks. He lifted her by one arm and shook her when she lagged on the trail, then refused her share of roasted roots for a day. He said noise drew danger and slowed feet meant hunger for everyone. Ruma tried to step between them, but she also had to keep pace, keep the fire alive, and carry what they owned. Yama stopped crying when she was hurt. She stared at the ground and counted steps. She learned when to speak and when to stay silent.

Her brother Kenu was born two summers after her, red-faced and loud. As soon as Yama could walk the full day, she helped. She carried a small bundle of kindling. She watched Kenu while Ruma gathered. When Hanu’s voice rose, Yama pulled Kenu behind her and made him chew on a strip of bark to keep him quiet. She began to talk fast in other moments—too fast—filling the air with chatter when strangers arrived or when a child fell and began to wail. Lina, a girl her age, laughed at how Yama greeted everyone before they sat down, even before elders spoke. Yama liked Lina’s laughter. She liked mornings when mist hung low and the first meal was hot broth made from crushed nuts and fish scraps. She liked the taste of smoked shellfish and the soft fat under the skin when they found a turtle.

From six to nine the beatings continued whenever scarcity returned. Yama became useful enough that Hanu’s anger shifted from blows to sharp words and stares. She learned camp routines the way other children learned games. She knew which families shared without keeping count and which counted every strip of dried meat. She remembered who had a newborn, who was limping, who had lost a tool. She avoided new ways of doing things. When a visiting man demonstrated a different knot for a carrying sling, she watched, then kept tying hers the old way.

In her early teens Yama began joining longer foraging trips. She was small, so she did not haul the heaviest loads. Instead she organized. She told children where to sit while adults cut meat. She reminded people to check fish traps on the way back. When tempers rose, she pressed a hand to an arm and spoke softly, offering to trade portions so no one had to admit taking too much. Her voice carried across camp. It carried far enough that visiting groups remembered it.

At sixteen she began sleeping near Senu, a young man from within the same local territory. He fished well and didn’t push his weight into others. He accepted that Yama talked through decisions out loud. They built a household around one hearth. Yama hung drying racks where smoke reached them and where children would not knock them over. She liked the order of it: water brought early, fire fed, shares separated, then shared again.

At eighteen she gave birth to her first child, Tala, a daughter. Yama kept the baby against her chest and kept working, cutting tubers and sorting shells with one hand. When Tala was two, coughing took her. Kiri came and circled the hearth, tapping a drum and pulling at the air as if drawing out something stuck. Ruma brought hot stones wrapped in leaves to warm Tala’s belly. Tala died before the next nut season. Yama washed the child and kept her hair tied back while others dug, so her hands stayed steady. Afterward she woke in the dark and checked the sleeping mats again and again.

A son, Tomi, came a year later, then another daughter, Mina, three years after that. Yama kept her children close to adults she trusted and away from Hanu when he came into camp tense from poor hunting. She learned when to offer him the first bite so he would settle. She also learned to bend the truth when she needed to. If fish were few, she told Hanu the best trap had been checked already even when it had not, then sent someone else to check it later, out of his sight.

When Yama was twenty-seven, she went to a riverside meeting with another camp to settle who could use a productive stretch of water. She carried a basket of dried fish and smoked shellfish meant as a gift. She spoke first, smiling and greeting every adult by name or relation. Then an argument broke out over the basket itself—who it belonged to, who deserved the first grab. A woman from the other camp, Pira, stepped forward and swung a digging stick into Yama’s shoulder and face. Yama fell hard and her mouth filled with blood. Someone dragged Pira back while others yelled. Yama stood up quickly, wiping her lip with the back of her hand, speaking in a fast stream to keep the moment from turning into a raid. That night she sat apart from the fire with Lina and rubbed ash into the bruise so it wouldn’t swell as much. She avoided that stretch of river afterward unless Senu or Kenu walked beside her.

Ruma died that same year. It happened after a stomach sickness that swept through camp. Yama took over Ruma’s work without asking. She assigned children to fetch water. She rationed dried food and sent Senu and Kenu out in opposite directions so at least one would return with something. She spoke for others during quarrels and took the blame when shares were uneven, because she could absorb anger better than most. Kenu, now an adult, listened to her. He teased her about how she counted bundles twice, then did what she asked.

Hanu died six years later. His death removed the threat that had shaped Yama since childhood, but it also removed a provider and a man other men listened to. Yama leaned harder into relationships. She hosted visitors at her hearth and sent Mina with small gifts—shell beads, smoked fish—to women who could sway their husbands. She went to Kiri more often, asking for divination when her worries wouldn’t stop. Kiri burned resin and pressed a palm to Yama’s forehead, then told her which river bend to avoid and which ancestor name to speak aloud before a trip.

In her late thirties Yama became pregnant again. She kept working, organizing shellfish collecting in the wet months and planning the move to higher ground before the coldest nights. She slept lightly and startled at raised voices, then forced herself to sit close to the fire and talk, keeping others talking too.

Labor began when she was thirty-eight. Women gathered close, and Kiri was there with smoke, water, and a smooth stone warmed at the edge of the fire. The baby, Nari, came out silent. Blood followed. They tried to stop it with pressure and cold water and herbs crushed between stones. Yama’s skin went pale and slick. She stayed conscious long enough to grab Senu’s wrist and speak quickly, naming where food was stored and which relatives should take Mina and Tomi if he failed. She died before the sun reached its highest point.

They buried her on a low rise above the river, where the ground stayed firm after rain. Mina placed a small bundle of shell beads in Yama’s hands, and Kiri left a pinch of smoked fish at the edge of the grave, speaking to the dead so Yama’s spirit would not follow the living back to camp.
