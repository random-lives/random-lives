#     name: Iōannēs
#     narrative_role: 'Agricultural day laborer/seasonal farmhand; present but often
#       away on harvest work. Relationship is practical and sometimes harsh: quick discipline
#       when food is short, pride when Michaēl shows cleverness; expects obedience and
#       useful help.'
#     role: father
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Maria
#     narrative_role: Domestic labor plus seasonal field work; primary day-to-day caregiver.
#       Affectionate but stressed, relying on icon-corner prayers and folk protections;
#       pushes Michaēl to be responsible with the younger children and to avoid provoking
#       richer neighbors.
#     role: mother
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 5
#     connection: 'Late summer/early autumn 1362: goat/kid theft occurs while father
#       is away at harvest; household food insecurity worsens and sets up the later
#       ''hungry season'' motive for Michaēl’s petty theft.'
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 6
#     connection: 'Late summer 1363 over several weeks: Michaēl takes figs/grapes/kindling
#       from a better-off neighbor’s edge; driven by hunger after earlier losses and
#       by bold, low-humility rule-bending.'
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   - age: 6
#     connection: 'Late summer 1363: caught/accused during the petty theft period; older
#       boy and his uncle beat him. The assault increases tension between households
#       and makes Michaēl more wary but also resentful.'
#     incident: physical_assault
#   - age: 6
#     connection: 'Winter 1363–1364: fall from terrace wall/rocky slope while gathering
#       wood or minding animals; incapacitates him for weeks, coinciding with mother’s
#       late pregnancy and reducing household labor capacity.'
#     incident: serious_accident
#   - age: 6
#     connection: 'From the winter fall onward: lingering limp/hip-leg weakness; he
#       can’t keep up on steep ground, is assigned lighter tasks, and becomes more talkative/observant
#       (intelligence/openness expressed through watching and planning rather than running).'
#     incident: acquired_disability
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Kyrillos
#     prominence: Recurring background figure, especially during illness fears (any
#       year) and after the orchard dispute (1363).
#     relationship: village priest or chapel-keeper who blesses fields/animals and mediates
#       disputes
#   - name: Markos
#     prominence: Prominent in late summer 1363 (theft accusation/assault).
#     relationship: older boy from a better-off household involved in the beating
#   - name: Theodoros
#     prominence: Brief but intense presence in late summer 1363.
#     relationship: Markos’s uncle (adult male) who joins the beating and threatens
#       Michaēl’s father
#   - name: Eirēnē
#     prominence: Prominent in 1362–1364 (after the goat theft, during sickness scares,
#       and after Michaēl’s disabling injury).
#     relationship: neighbor woman known for folk protections/amulets and healing advice
#   siblings:
#   - birth_year: 1357
#     death_age: 7
#     death_year: 1364
#     name: Michaēl
#     narrative_role: Eldest child; bright, quick-talking and curious, often sent on
#       errands and to watch smaller children. Feels responsibility for the younger
#       boys, but is also headstrong and willing to bend rules when hungry or bored.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1359
#     death_age: 3
#     death_year: 1362
#     name: Geōrgios
#     narrative_role: The first younger brother; a toddler Michaēl helps mind when their
#       mother goes to fields. His early death sharpens household fear of sickness and
#       makes Michaēl more protective and more angry at unfairness.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1361
#     death_age: 72
#     death_year: 1433
#     name: Nikolaos
#     narrative_role: A baby/toddler during Michaēl’s life; mostly remembered as someone
#       Michaēl carried, soothed, and entertained. Later becomes the keeper of Michaēl’s
#       memory in family stories.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1364
#     death_age: 40
#     death_year: 1404
#     name: Dēmētrios
#     narrative_role: Born the year Michaēl dies (likely after the disabling accident);
#       his existence frames the household’s final months as a time of maternal strain
#       and scarce attention. He never knows Michaēl directly but grows up hearing the
#       story of the clever eldest who died young.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Adults alternate between admiration and suspicion; his cleverness
#       helps the household (errands done well) but also enables risky boundary-pushing
#       (petty theft).
#     scene: He learns village routines fast—predicts when the richer neighbor’s sons
#       are away, notices which paths avoid adults, and can mentally track measures/portions
#       and bargaining talk at the edge of the market without being taught to read.
#     timing: Ages 4–6 (especially 1361–1363)
#     trait: Intelligence (99th percentile)
#   - consequence: He gains information and allies but also attracts conflict, making
#       the beating more plausible and public.
#     scene: He inserts himself into work-groups, chats with older laborers, loudly
#       tells stories or riddles at the threshold of the house and near the fountain,
#       and is quick to challenge other boys.
#     timing: Ages 3–6
#     trait: Extraversion (85th percentile)
#   - consequence: He is given responsibilities early; after his injury, the household
#       feels the loss of his usefulness more sharply.
#     scene: When tasked with watching baby Nikolaos or minding a small flock, he is
#       unusually reliable for his age—counts animals, double-checks gates, and remembers
#       what his mother told him to fetch.
#     timing: Ages 4–7
#     trait: Conscientiousness (81st percentile)
#   - consequence: Escalates the orchard dispute into a beating instead of a quieter
#       resolution.
#     scene: He argues with other children, refuses to back down when accused, and responds
#       to insults with sharp words rather than appeasement.
#     timing: Peak at age 6 (1363)
#     trait: Agreeableness low (33rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Increases social penalty when caught; feeds into adults’ willingness
#       to use rough, humiliating discipline.
#     scene: He rationalizes taking fruit/wood as 'they have plenty' and initially denies
#       it when confronted, trying to outtalk the accusation.
#     timing: Age 6 (late summer 1363)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility low (22nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Resilience keeps him engaged, but also makes him underestimate danger—setting
#       a background plausibility for the later fall.
#     scene: After sickness scares and even after the beating, he rebounds quickly,
#       talks big, and returns to play/work rather than withdrawing.
#     timing: Ages 5–6
#     trait: Neuroticism low (31st percentile)
#   - consequence: Deepens his attachment to folk-protective practice and makes him
#       an eager participant in household rituals during epidemic scares.
#     scene: He is fascinated by saints’ stories and local healing lore—asks about why
#       certain springs are 'strong,' why icons are carried in procession, and imitates
#       prayers/charms he hears from older women.
#     timing: Ages 4–7
#     trait: Openness moderately high (68th percentile)
# number_of_siblings: '3'
# religion: 'Greek Orthodox practice with strong local folk protection: icons + amulets/evil-eye
#   protections, healing rituals/prayers, blessing fields/animals, heavy reliance on
#   saints’ shrines'
# sibling_ages_at_death:

# structured_incidents:
# - event: While his father was away doing harvest day-labor on another household’s
#     land, someone stole a small goat (or kid) from their yard at night and the family
#     could not recover it, worsening their food and milk supply.
#   reasoning: Poor near-landless households had little to steal, and a 7-year-old is
#     rarely the direct target; however, petty theft of household goods/animals did
#     occur in rural villages.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Age 5 (late summer–early autumn, 1362)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: During a hungry season he repeatedly took figs/grapes and a little kindling
#     from the edge of a better-off neighbor’s orchard/woodpile when sent out to watch
#     animals, and was caught and shamed/struck by an adult.
#   reasoning: Children could commit small thefts (food, fruit, small items) especially
#     in poor settings, but it’s still not something most children are recorded as doing
#     even if it happened occasionally.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Recurring over several weeks, age 6 (late summer, 1363)
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime
# - event: He was beaten by an older boy (and briefly by that boy’s uncle) after being
#     accused of taking fruit; the assault left him bruised and sore for days but he
#     recovered.
#   reasoning: Non-domestic violence could include being beaten by other children/older
#     youths or by non-parent adults (e.g., during disputes, at work sites), but is
#     less common than caregiver violence at this age.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 6 (late summer, 1363)
#   type: physical_assault
# - event: He fell from a terrace wall/rocky slope while gathering firewood or herding
#     near the village and suffered a significant injury that kept him mostly homebound
#     and unable to help for weeks.
#   reasoning: Rural children frequently suffered significant falls, animal-related
#     injuries, or burns that could incapacitate them even if they survived; this is
#     a common route to a 'serious health incident' before his terminal accident.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 6–7 (winter, 1363–1364)
#   type: serious_accident
# - event: After the fall, he was left with a persistent limp and reduced strength in
#     one leg/hip, making it hard to keep up on steep ground and limiting what errands
#     or herding he could do.
#   reasoning: Lasting disability from infection or injury (limp after fracture, vision
#     loss from infection/trauma, hearing loss after illness) was possible but less
#     common than transient severe illness.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: From age 6–7 until death (1363–1364)
#   type: acquired_disability

Michaēl was born on August 7, 1357 in a small Rum village in the wooded hills above the Orontes plain, where Orthodox Christians lived under Mamluk tax collectors and watched the roads for raiders from the north and east. His father, Iōannēs, took day work wherever an estate needed hands—grape harvest, olive picking, carrying sheaves—while his mother, Maria, kept the house, spun and mended, and went out for weeding and gleaning when she could.

An icon of the Theotokos stood in their corner by a small oil lamp. Maria tucked a bit of blue glass on a string near the children’s necks against the evil eye, and she kept a little pouch of herbs from Eirēnē, the neighbor who gave remedies and prayers. Michaēl copied words he heard, asked why one spring was “strong” and another “weak,” and corrected other boys when they counted animals wrong. He talked to anyone who would answer, even grown men resting at the edge of the fields.

Geōrgios arrived in 1359. Michaēl carried him on his hip while Maria worked, and learned to hush him with crusts and water. The toddler died in 1362 after days of sickness, and the same season a thief came at night and took their small goat. Iōannēs went out angry with other men, but the animal stayed gone.

In late summer 1363 hunger sharpened Michaēl’s choices. Sent to watch a neighbor’s plot, he slipped figs and a few grapes into his shirt and broke kindling from a woodpile. Markos, an older boy, caught him. When Michaēl argued and denied it, Markos’s uncle Theodoros struck him and Markos followed, leaving him bruised for days.

Winter brought a harder injury. In January 1364, gathering firewood above the terraces, Michaēl fell from a rocky edge. His hip and leg swelled; he lay inside for weeks, then rose with a limp that never left. Maria was heavy with another child and set him to lighter tasks.

On October 14, 1364, still limping, he climbed a low terrace wall near the pens and fell again, striking his head on stone. Kyrillos read prayers over the body in the village church; they wrapped him in cloth and buried him in the earth beside other Orthodox graves, with a small wooden cross pressed into the mound.
