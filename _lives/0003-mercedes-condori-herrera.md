#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Helps her secure clients and allies, but also draws her into public
#       conflicts and drinking circles.
#     scene: At market and washing sites she talks fast, jokes, negotiates prices, and
#       gathers news; she is the one who speaks to officials/clients when others avoid
#       it.
#     timing: Adolescence through adulthood (ages 15-39)
#     trait: Extraversion (very high)
#   - consequence: Makes her adaptable and socially flexible, but also prone to novelty-seeking
#       that feeds alcohol use and unsettled relationships.
#     scene: She is curious about outsiders’ stories, tries new remedies/ritual mixes
#       (saints plus offerings), and is eager for fairs/fiestas and new work methods.
#     timing: Childhood onward, strongest in teens and 20s
#     trait: Openness (very high)
#   - consequence: Contributes to client losses early on, fuels conflict with partner,
#       and worsens debt during the economic crisis.
#     scene: Misses agreed washing delivery times, forgets items unless she builds routines;
#       household budgeting slips, especially during drinking binges.
#     timing: Young adulthood into separation years (ages 20-39)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (low)
#   - consequence: 'Allows recovery after crisis: she strategically chooses clients
#       and schedules work to stabilize food access.'
#     scene: Despite illiteracy, she keeps track of complex informal credit (who owes
#       what), remembers faces and kin networks, and learns which households pay reliably.
#     timing: Adulthood (ages 25-39), especially during achievement period
#     trait: Intelligence (high)
#   - consequence: Accelerates separation, damages reputation, increases risk of accidents,
#       and strains relationship with surviving son and siblings.
#     scene: Regular chicha/aguardiente intake escalates after grief and separation;
#       she spends money meant for food, arrives smelling of drink, and has periods
#       of abstinence followed by binge episodes around fiestas and paydays.
#     timing: Begins subtly in late teens/20s; becomes impairing ages 30-39
#     trait: Alcohol use disorder (visible)
# number_of_children: '3'
# number_of_siblings: '9'
# occupation: Washerwoman / laundry and cleaning services

#     child relied on kin meals while she took irregular washing jobs and pawned clothing/blankets
#     to cover food and rent.
#   reasoning: Her adult standing is explicitly downward to poor/working-class and she
#     lacked stable spousal support; periods of acute shortage, debt, or inability to
#     meet rent/food needs were common.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 31–33 (c. 1888–1890)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: She secured a steady set of paying laundry clients among better-off town
#     households (including a shopkeeper and a parish-connected family), becoming known
#     for reliable work; this let her consistently feed her household and be trusted
#     with bundles of clothing despite her low status.
#   reasoning: Illiteracy, poverty, and women’s limited formal avenues to recognition
#     make notable public achievement uncommon, though informal community respect or
#     running a steady client base could occur.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 34–37 (c. 1891–1894)
#   type: major_achievement
# - event: During the War of the Pacific period, a detachment passed through her district
#     and requisitioned food, animals, and cloth; her family temporarily relocated to
#     stay with relatives outside the town center until the troops moved on and local
#     tensions eased.
#   reasoning: Given she stayed in the Huancavelica locality during the War of the Pacific
#     era, the most plausible 'direct impact' is civilian exposure such as troop movements,
#     requisitioning, local skirmishes, or brief displacement rather than frontline
#     combat.

Mercedes Condori Herrera was born on August 29, 1857 in Pumararanra, in the high cold country of Huancavelica, where the Peruvian republic’s officials and priests kept records in Spanish and most households spoke Quechua at the hearth. Her family lived by town work, Catholic feast days, and the small reciprocal rituals of the Andes: candles for the saints, coca leaves and a splash of aguardiente for Pachamama at the threshold, and respect for the apus that ringed the valley.

Her father, Isidro Condori, worked with his hands in a small workshop and took jobs that needed measuring, cutting, and bargaining. He spoke Spanish easily with customers and officials and switched to Quechua with neighbors. Her mother, María Herrera, managed the home: cooking, washing, watching children, and taking small paid tasks when she could. The house filled quickly. Tomás, the first child, died in 1859, and Mercedes grew up with the sound of adult voices lowering when that year was mentioned. Two years later Rufina was born and did not live past her first day. More children followed: Eusebio in 1861, Petrona in 1863, then Anselmo and Nicanor who also died as infants. The surviving children learned early to step over grief and carry water.

Mercedes was a small girl, shorter than most women her age would become. She moved fast anyway. She followed her father to the workshop door and tried to talk her way into carrying messages or delivering small pieces. Isidro used her as a runner because she did not freeze when addressed by an adult. He let her stand close as he spoke to men in hats and women in shawls, and she learned to listen for price, tone, and insult. María Herrera tried to keep her home when the babies were small; Mercedes argued and laughed, then slipped out with a bundle of cloth under her arm.

When sickness moved through the district in the late 1860s, people spoke of it at the market and after Mass. Mothers watched children’s faces and wiped benches more carefully. A vaccinator came through with his lancets and a list. María Herrera brought the children she still had. Mercedes complained about the sting and made a game of comparing the small scabs with other girls. She liked the bustle of those days: the crowd around the church patio, the mixture of Spanish and Quechua, the way adults talked too much because they were afraid.

By her teens she carried real responsibilities. She scrubbed clothes at the cold edge of a stream and learned how to boil water without wasting fuel. She could rub soap into cuffs until the water turned gray and still talk the whole time. On feast days she stayed near the plaza longer than María wanted, drawn by music and the sellers of fried cakes and roasted corn. She drank chicha before she should have, not in secret so much as in plain sight, a cup passed with a grin. She loved gossip and arguments. She hated being told to wait.

In 1876 she entered a union with Julián Rojas, a man who worked with wood and stone when work was offered and talked big when it was not. He was lively at dances and quick with compliments. They set up their own small household within walking distance of her parents, close enough that María Herrera could arrive without knocking. Mercedes liked the change and the public fact of being paired. She was at the center of things then—fights, jokes, the small negotiations over credit and food.

A daughter, María Antonia Rojas Condori, was born in 1878 and died before the month ended. Mercedes attended the baptism at speed, insisting on it, pressing the baby into the priest’s hands and back again. Afterward she kept a candle before the Virgin and still laid coca on the ground at the doorway, asking for protection in both languages of her life. She drank more openly at the next fiesta, and people let it pass because everyone understood how close infant death sat.

The war years reached Huancavelica as disruption rather than battles. In 1881, with Peru’s coast under invasion and the state desperate, a detachment passed through her district. Men demanded food, animals, and cloth. They searched storerooms and counted sacks as if the household were a treasury. Julián argued with them and then stopped, seeing the rifles. Mercedes gathered what she could carry: a cooking pot, a blanket, her small son Isidro—born that same year—and she followed relatives out to a hamlet away from the town center. They slept crowded on packed earth and returned after the soldiers moved on, finding that some goods were gone and debts remained.

The household tried again. A second son, Benito Rojas Condori, was born in 1885 and died soon after. That loss did not bring Julián and Mercedes closer. Julián took more days away. Mercedes answered him sharply when he returned with little money. She began spending evenings with Sebastiana Huayta, a washerwoman who worked hard and drank hard, too. They sat near a chichería doorway, watching people pass, laughing at men who strutted and women who pretended not to listen. Mercedes could be charming for an hour and cruel the next, especially after aguardiente.

Her father Isidro Condori died in 1884, leaving no workshop income to buffer the younger households. Without him, the family’s disputes had no soft center. María Herrera’s rules tightened; Mercedes fought them. Her brother Eusebio tried to mediate, offering practical advice and then giving up when she mocked him. Petrona, more patient, pulled Mercedes aside and spoke plainly: work first, drink later. Mercedes agreed and did not follow through.

In 1888 Julián Rojas left. He walked out after an argument about money and never returned to share a roof with her. Mercedes, thirty-one, took her surviving son Isidro and moved into an extended kin house, squeezed among siblings and cousins. That year and the next were her worst. Don Mateo Salazar, a shopkeeper who also acted as a landlord for small rooms, called in what she owed. She pawned a blanket, then a spare shawl, then a cooking pot, retrieving some items and losing others. She left bundles of laundry unfinished. Some days she stayed in bed late with her mouth dry and her temper quick, then went out and talked fast to cover the delay.

Isidro, her son, learned to go to Aunt Petrona for bread when Mercedes came home with nothing. He also learned how to bring her a cup of water and step back when her eyes were glassy. Mercedes could be affectionate, pulling him close and telling him stories she had heard from muleteers in the plaza—stories of Lima, of soldiers, of trains—things she never saw but kept alive in her head. She promised him small treats and sometimes delivered them: a sweet bun, a strip of roasted meat on a stick.

In 1891 she forced a change. She rose early and went to the washing place before other women arrived, choosing a flat rock she liked and setting her soap, brush, and cord in the same order each day. She used her sharp memory to keep track of garments by stain and stitch, not by any written mark. That year she secured steady clients, including Doña Basilia Paredes, a parish-connected matron who cared about cleanliness and punctuality. Mercedes learned which households paid on time, which ones tried to undercount, which ones would complain to the priest. She laughed with the servants at the back doors, teased children, and carried bundles on her back with the cord biting her shoulders.

María Herrera died in 1893. The wake filled with prayers and murmured Quechua, and Mercedes set out coca and a small pour of liquor on the earth outside before stepping back in to kneel at the rosary. After the burial, the kin house rearranged itself. Petrona took on more authority. Eusebio kept offering help in careful portions, never handing Mercedes too much money at once.

Mercedes kept working through 1894, keeping her clients and feeding Isidro, though she still drank. Some weeks she stayed away from the chichería; other weeks she arrived there with Sebastiana, loud and restless, and spent what she had just earned. Her talk could win forgiveness, then lose it again.

On October 8, 1896, late in the day, she carried a heavy bundle of wet clothes near the stream after a long wash. The rocks were slick. She slipped, fell hard, and struck her head. Her kin brought her home, but she did not recover.

They washed her body, dressed her simply, and kept candles burning beside a small image of the Virgin. Before the coffin was closed, Petrona placed a few coca leaves near Mercedes’ hands, and the family carried her to the cemetery after the priest’s prayers.
