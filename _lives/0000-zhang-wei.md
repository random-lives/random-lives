#   - consequence: Builds helpful networks for jobs and loans, but also gets pulled
#       into drinking nights and messy relationship situations.
#     scene: On the construction crew he quickly becomes the talker who negotiates with

#     trait: Extraversion (very high, 90th percentile)
#   - consequence: Remains a general laborer longer, making marriage and long-term stability
#       harder; periodic money arguments with family/partners.

# structured_incidents:
# - event: In his early 20s while working on construction sites in a prefecture-level
#     city (likely within Guizhou or a neighboring province), he had a girlfriend he
#     met through coworkers/nearby rentals; they had consensual sex while dating and
#     living in separate shared rooms (not married and without formal cohabitation registration).
#   reasoning: A heterosexual never-married man born in 1995, living as a long-term
#     migrant worker with very high extraversion, is quite likely to have had at least
#     one consensual sexual relationship outside marriage.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 20–23 (2015–2018)
#   type: premarital_sex
# - event: Later, during a period when he was in a ‘serious’ relationship with a long-distance
#     girlfriend back in/near his home county, he also had sex with another woman he
#     met socially near the worksite (e.g., at a small restaurant/KTV area), keeping
#     it discreet because of gossip among coworkers and fear of conflict.
#   reasoning: He is not currently married and we have no evidence of cohabiting marriage-like
#     stability; extramarital sex could occur if he had a 'primary partner' (girlfriend/fiancée)
#     and also other partners, but this is less common than simple premarital sex.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 25–27 (2020–2022)

Zhang Wei was born on October 21, 1995, in a village area of Gouchang in Zhijin County, Bijie, in the mountainous karst of western Guizhou. The county sat firmly inside the People’s Republic of China, governed through township and county offices, and the family lived in the everyday Han world of Southwestern Mandarin, state schools, and seasonal rites at graves and household altars rather than regular temple attendance.

His father, Zhang Guoshun, farmed small plots and kept a few animals when feed allowed. His mother, Luo Meilan, ran the household and worked the fields when planting and harvesting came. The house held a third adult too: his paternal grandmother, Zhang Shuhua. She slept close to the kitchen warmth in winter, kept the money in a cloth pouch, and watched the children when the parents were in the fields. Wei arrived after two girls. Zhang Li, born in 1989, already handled chores with a seriousness that made her seem older than she was. Zhang Fang, born in 1992, watched Wei with quick attention and laughed at him when he tried to keep up.

The family was poor enough that every purchase carried a small argument. Soap, cooking oil, a new pair of shoes for school—Meilan counted and recounted. Guoshun’s temper rose fastest when someone broke a tool or wasted grain. Still, the house had routines. Before Spring Festival, Shuhua supervised the cleaning, then taped fresh red paper couplets at the door. On Qingming, they carried paper money, incense, and a small bottle of baijiu to the graves. Wei learned to bow, set the incense upright, and wait while adults spoke quietly to ancestors by name.

He started primary school with a slate of cheap notebooks and a pencil cut short from use. His teachers drilled characters and basic arithmetic. He talked more than he studied. At home, he chased his sisters into laughter, then got scolded for making noise when Shuhua wanted quiet. In summer he liked cold noodles with vinegar from a roadside stall after school; in winter he hovered near the stove and peeled sweet potatoes, stealing bites before they cooled.

When he was twelve, winter weather came hard. In early 2008 freezing rain turned paths slick and coated branches and wires. The village spent days with unreliable power and slow travel to the town market. Guoshun worried aloud about food prices and the condition of the animals. Wei, home from school, carried water carefully and learned how quickly a small hardship could spread across the household.

The following year brought a change that cut deeper. In 2009 Shuhua’s health failed after months of coughing and weakness. She still insisted on sitting upright to supervise meals, then began to stay in bed. Wei hovered around her more than he admitted, asking if she wanted tea, then leaving the cup untouched when she waved him away. She died that year. Afterward Meilan’s days stretched longer, and Wei’s sisters stepped in without being asked. Wei became more irritable when corrected and more clingy when he felt the house turning quiet. He began to take small worries into the night—money, school, whether his father would get angry—then covered it the next day by being louder.

Between 2009 and 2011 the area went through repeated dry stretches that made water management a regular topic at home. Wei carried buckets and watched his father argue with neighbors about whose turn it was at a shared source. School mattered less than cash. His marks stayed middling, and when teachers pushed him toward more study he joked his way out and promised he would try tomorrow.

By 2010 he had started middle school, taller than many classmates and quick to find friends. He sat with boys who traded cheap cigarettes and stories about jobs in cities. In 2011 he joined older youths at night markets when they visited town, buying skewers and sweet drinks with coins they should have saved. He liked being the one who ordered, who called out to stall owners, who made others laugh by repeating their accents.

At fifteen he began talking about leaving. Roads improved, buses ran more reliably, and people returned from Guangdong and other provinces with smartphones and new jackets. His father complained about foolish spending, then asked those same returnees for contact numbers. In 2013, after leaving school, Wei took short jobs near home—moving materials, helping a mason, loading sacks—and then followed introductions to city work. He learned the rhythm of labor hiring: early mornings, men crowding around a foreman, bargaining fast, taking whatever came.

A labor broker everyone called Qian Laoban pulled him into a crew and taught him what mattered on site: keep your helmet on when supervisors appear, carry more than you talk when the concrete arrives, and don’t count on wages coming exactly on time. Wei listened when the talk was practical. When it came to saving money, he drifted. A good pay month meant he bought better meals for the room, treated coworkers to beer, and sent a remittance home late with a cheerful excuse.

He rented shared rooms near worksites and slept on narrow beds with his clothes folded at his feet. He made friends easily. One was He Ming, a fellow villager who became his closest companion in the city. They ate late-night bowls of noodles, played cards, and joked about foremen behind their backs. When Wei felt cornered by worry, he walked outside to a convenience store, bought sunflower seeds, and chewed them while watching traffic.

In 2016, at twenty-one, he met Li Jing through coworkers and nearby rentals. She worked in the city and had her own small circle of friends. Wei talked too much on their first few meetings and still got her number. They dated fast, meeting after shifts for spicy hotpot or rice noodles, then sitting outside on plastic stools and watching people pass. They had sex that year, private and practical, in rented rooms with thin walls and a shared bathroom down the hall. He told He Ming about it in a bragging tone, then stopped when he saw how quickly stories traveled.

The relationship ran on energy and then wore down. Wei changed sites. Li Jing wanted clearer plans. He forgot promises, arrived late, spent money on nights out and apologized afterward. In 2018 she ended it. He took it badly for a week, calling too often, then pretending it didn’t matter. He sent more money home for a while as if that proved something.

In 2019 he began a serious long-distance relationship with Chen Xia, a woman from near his home county he connected with through hometown networks and WeChat. Her family asked about marriage early. His own parents asked too, especially with his sisters aging into their own households. Wei answered with jokes, then with irritation when pressed. He liked Chen Xia’s attention and the sense that someone waited for him, but he avoided the hard steps: formal visits, bride price negotiations, the question of where to live.

COVID-19 changed his working life in 2020. Travel restrictions and testing rules cut routes, sites paused, and hiring became uneven. He spent long evenings in cramped rooms scrolling his phone, then going downstairs to smoke with other men who were also stuck. He called Chen Xia more often and argued more. She complained about his lack of direction. He complained about her demands.

In 2021, during that strained period, he slept with another woman, Liu Yan, whom he met through the social strip near a worksite—small restaurants, loud rooms, people drinking after shifts. He kept it quiet. He watched his phone for messages afterward, feared gossip, and acted extra attentive to Chen Xia in calls. The secrecy made him jumpy. He lashed out at He Ming for a minor joke and later bought him a pack of cigarettes to smooth it over.

Chen Xia ended the relationship in 2022. Wei did not fight for it. He told his mother it “didn’t work out” and changed the topic. As restrictions eased, work steadied again. By 2023 he had a regular place in a crew, still doing general labor—carrying materials, clearing debris, helping skilled workers—without moving into a trade. He liked the days when tasks were simple and the crew joked through the heat.

In 2024 and 2025 he returned home for Spring Festival visits, bringing gifts and cash, sitting with his father at the table while his sisters, Zhang Li and Zhang Fang, talked about their children and household expenses. He listened, teased them, and then went quiet when his mother asked again about settling down. He left after the holiday each time with a bag of cured meat and pickled vegetables, and a list of small errands from home.

By late 2025 he is thirty, living most of the year away from Zhijin in a rented room near construction sites, working days that start before sunrise. He eats breakfast from street stalls, jokes loudly with his crew, and calls home at night when the room feels too still. He keeps a few hundred yuan set aside in his phone wallet, enough to feel secure for a week or two, and sends the rest when his mother asks. He is unmarried, childless, and busy. Tomorrow’s shift is already arranged. Tonight he sits on the edge of the bed, shoes lined up neatly for once, listening to messages in the crew chat and deciding whether to join the others for noodles downstairs.
