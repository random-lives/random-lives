Klu‑Mo was born on September 16, 520 BC in the high grass and conifer edge above the valleys of what is now Yushu, on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. No distant court governed her family’s camp. Authority sat with elders of a local clan, and disputes and alliances ran through kin and herd. Her people spoke a Plateau Tibeto‑Burman tongue of the Qiangic/Rgyalrongic kind, and they fed the hearth with dung and scrub wood.

Her father, Dru‑Na, kept yaks and sheep and tended a small patch of hardy grain near a stream that ran clear in summer and locked under ice in winter. Her mother, Ama Ngi, carried water, churned, dried dung for fuel, and spun wool when the weather pinned everyone indoors. Klu‑Mo went to her mother’s breast and then to her aunt’s. In 519 BC, Ama Ngi’s younger brother Sho‑Ri and his wife Zho‑Me took Klu‑Mo into their tent at birth, and Ama Ngi came each day to work and to feed her.

Klu‑Mo learned the weight of a wool wrap and the press of bodies in a smoke-dark shelter. She cried hard and long when she wanted milk. She struck at hands that tried to wipe her face.

In 517 BC, late summer brought sickness through the camp. Klu‑Mo passed watery stool through the night. Zho‑Me boiled water and cooled it in a wooden bowl, and Sho‑Ri carried snowmelt from higher ground. On September 14, 517 BC, Klu‑Mo died.

Her brother Gya‑Me was born in 517 BC and grew past infancy. Another boy, Nge‑Zi, was born and died in 515 BC. A third, Tsa‑Ri, was born in 513 BC and died at eight.
