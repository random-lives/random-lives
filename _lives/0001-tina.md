historical_notes:
  - "Highlands agriculture long predates 470–500 AD: Kuk Swamp (Wahgi Valley) shows drainage works and cultivation starting ~7,000–10,000 years ago, placing Tina’s garden labor in a very old Highlands tradition."
  - "Before sweet potato’s later introduction, Highland staples were typically taro, bananas, yams, sugarcane, and pandanus; in wet montane valleys (~1,300–1,500 m) prolonged rain can trigger waterlogging/rot and landslips like those described."
  - "Highlands politics commonly ran through pig-based compensation and exchange: pigs (and valuables like shell wealth) were central to settling injuries, garden-boundary disputes, and alliance maintenance, so a pig mortality episode would directly strain “payments” and peace-making."
  - "The central cordillera is extremely linguistically dense; short-distance moves can cross language boundaries, and exchange/mediation often required bilingualism—consistent with a local non–Trans–New Guinea highlands language at home plus conversational use of a neighboring Trans–New Guinea language in trade and dispute talk."
  - "Religion was typically non-scriptural and place-based: ancestor and place-spirit rites linked gardening, illness, and accidents to taboo-breaking, prompting offerings and short-term food/place restrictions after ominous events—matching the narrative’s ritual tightening after misfortune."
  - "No contemporary written records exist for Highlands communities in 470–500 AD; the historically secure anchors are archaeology (e.g., Kuk Swamp) and well-attested Highlands institutions of gardening, pigs, compensation, and exchange that structure a life like Tina’s."

He was born in wet high country near the spine of New Guinea, where ridges squeezed the valleys and rain could hold for days. Nights cooled enough that the fire stayed in the hearth. Houses stood on posts. Pigs moved under the floor. Smoke seeped through the thatch.

He was the fifth of ten children. The house was loud and cramped. His father shifted between garden plots, checked fences, cut brush, and carried greens down to the pigs. His mother dug and planted, hauled water and wood, cooked, and kept small children away from the fire. They lived like the other households: gardens that fed them in most years, pigs enough to stand in exchanges, nothing about the family that made people repeat their name.

As a boy he stayed back. He did not crowd into the best places and he did not talk over others. When older children fought, he watched. When adults spoke, he kept his eyes down and listened. After a while people stopped asking what he thought. He did not try to pull them back.

His face showed little. When he was pleased it barely moved. When he was angry he held it until it came out in one short sentence that landed hard.

When he was ten the rain did not lift when it usually did. Paths turned to slick clay. One night a slope above one of their gardens let go. In the morning the family stood at torn ground where a row of plants had been. His mother set aside cooked food and placed it at the edge of the raw earth. She spoke to the place the way she spoke at graves.

His father cut new stakes and began again higher up. The boy carried planting pieces and fence posts until his shoulders burned. He watched which relatives blamed his father for cutting too close to the slope and which defended him. He remembered who spoke first.

He grew into work that had clear edges. When men opened new ground, he chose steady tasks: trimming vines, stacking brush, setting posts straight. He watched how a fence sagged when stakes were shallow. He watched where water ran after a downpour and where it ate a path from underneath. He did not offer advice unless someone asked. When he was told to do something, he did it the same way each time, and he did not forget the exact words.

Marriage and exchange pulled people across language lines. The nearest valley spoke differently. He learned enough of that speech to trade and to follow quarrel talk. He learned it by listening, and by repeating only what he needed. He used it to answer questions without giving more than he meant to.

In his later teens pigs began dying in the valley. It started with one household’s animals going quiet and turning away from food. Within weeks other pens thinned. Pigs that normally shoved for scraps lay still and breathed hard. Under the houses the constant pushing stopped, replaced by long stretches of silence. Men argued about broken rules and who had dragged trouble close.

His father counted what they lost. With fewer pigs every promise tightened: a payment after an injury, a gift to cool a quarrel, pork to settle a hard word before it turned into a blow. Meals were watched. Plans were cut down.

A cousin came asking for feed and help. His father gave it. Later, when their own pen ran thin, that cousin turned away. The young man said nothing. He carried it inside him and did not set it down.

As he entered manhood, tension thickened along the paths. Men carried bows and heavy clubs more often. Injuries were discussed in low voices, with old insults and old gifts recited to make the present heavier. He avoided the center of crowds, but he listened at the edge and learned how words were used: which names were called up, which debts were counted again, which silences meant refusal.

His manner made him useful and disliked. People trusted him with talk because he did not pass it on. They watched him because he did not soften anything.

During a settlement talk held under the eaves of a house, a man laid out a payment meant to end the matter cheaply. Everyone there saw it. The young man said, flat, that it was small.

The talk stopped. Faces turned. His father cut him off with a look. He dropped his eyes and did not speak again. After that he was kept on outer tasks when men gathered: tying pigs, carrying wood, fetching water. No one wanted his voice in the middle.

In his early twenties he left his birth hamlet and walked into a nearby valley. It was a day on foot, but it meant different ground, different debts, and people who had not learned his habits. He married there. He and his wife lived as a couple in a small house near her kin. They had no children.

People spoke about it openly at pig killings and funerals. They said it within hearing, not to him. He never answered. He worked longer days. He kept the pig pen clean. He kept his face still.

A dispute rose over a garden edge and a pig that broke through a fence. The pig belonged to his household. The other man counted the damage high and demanded more than the loss. The young man did not soothe and he did not joke. He challenged the count piece by piece, in a level voice that made the other man feel mocked.

Relatives were pulled in. Older grudges were brought forward to thicken the claim. For days every visit carried the argument inside it. Meals were eaten with the dispute sitting between people.

Older men brought both sides onto open ground. They named the payment and required both households to clasp hands in front of witnesses. His household paid with food and pork from a butchered pig. He stood through it without any change in his face. When it ended he walked home without turning his head toward the other man. He felt the stare on his back and kept it.

In his mid-twenties he worked toward a large exchange meant to renew ties and cool the talk of fighting. For weeks people prepared. Pigs were fed carefully. Bundles were tied and checked and tied again. On the day, groups came in along muddy tracks, pigs tugging against fiber cords, greetings thrown across the clearing.

He stayed close to his own kin and kept to direct work: holding pigs, cutting, hauling water, tending fires. When arguments rose at the edge of the crowd, he watched which men quieted them and which men sharpened them. He listened to promises said in set phrases, so they could be repeated later without change.

The rain stayed heavy as he moved through his twenties. A flash flood tore through a side creek and stripped out part of the path. Stones and broken wood lay in a raw line where people usually walked. Visits narrowed. Travel for exchange thinned.

Then an animal was found dead near gardens with no clear wound. People spoke about it as a sign that rules had slipped. In the days that followed, mishaps came close together: a fall on a wet track, a child’s fever that rose fast, a pig that refused to eat. Older people named taboos.

Foods were avoided. Certain places were left alone. Work in a few patches was held back until small offerings were made. His wife’s kin watched who obeyed and who laughed. He followed every rule without argument. Rules kept people from striking each other. He did not say he was afraid, and he did not sneer.

The held-back patches left households short. To make up for it, men chose a new site on a steep slope where trees stood tall and straight. Near the end of his twenty-seventh year he went with them to open it.

The forest was wet. The ground held a slick skin of leaves over roots and clay. They chose a straight tree and cut it low, opening a notch, listening for the change in sound that said the trunk had started to go.

When it moved, a warning was shouted. He stepped back, but his foot slid on a wet root. He tried to shift his weight and found nothing that held. The slope dropped away. The tree came faster than he expected, pulled and twisted by vines in its crown.

The blow drove the air out of him. The men dragged him along the half-cut path, hands and knees packed with mud. His wife met them at the edge of the hamlet. He did not speak again. Rain kept falling through the afternoon.

He died that day.
