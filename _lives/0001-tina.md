historical_notes:
  - "Record limits (470–498 AD, inland New Guinea Highlands): there are no indigenous written records for highland communities at this time, and no contemporary external administration documenting individuals. Any personal name (e.g., “Tina”), precise birth/death dates, and life-history specifics should be treated as reconstructed narrative labels rather than recoverable historical biography for this location/period."
  - "Agricultural deep history relevant to the garden-boundary disputes in the story: highland wetland agriculture is archaeologically documented at Kuk Swamp (Wahgi Valley, PNG Highlands), with cultivation/drainage features beginning in the early-to-mid Holocene and later more organized field systems. This supports the plausibility of a late-1st-millennium AD highland world in which garden land, drainage, and boundary maintenance could be persistent foci of labor, conflict, and mediation."
  - "Exchange/wealth constraints for an inland montane setting in the late 5th century: the highland interior was not integrated into the Indian Ocean maritime trade networks that affected parts of Island Southeast Asia and some coastal New Guinea. For an inland hamlet, durable exotic goods (metals/ceramics) would be expected to be scarce-to-absent, so status and obligations would most plausibly be managed through locally producible wealth (food surpluses, labor, and—per later highlands ethnography—pigs), matching the narrative’s emphasis on compensation payments and ceremonial exchange labor."
  - "Pigs and social obligations (with epistemic caveat): archaeological and comparative evidence indicates pigs were introduced to New Guinea in the mid-to-late Holocene, well before 500 AD. Later ethnography from multiple highland regions shows pigs commonly function as core stores of value for compensation, alliance maintenance, and ceremonial exchange; using that as an analogy, a local pig-mortality episode would plausibly tighten the ability to meet debts/compensation and increase interpersonal strain as described—though the exact exchange institutions in Enga/Southern Highlands in 470–498 AD cannot be directly documented."
  - "Language/ethnicity/religion (not recoverable to a named group, but constrained by the profile): the individual is modeled as belonging to an inland highlands Papuan group with a primary language outside the Trans–New Guinea family, plus conversational competence in a neighboring Trans–New Guinea language. The narrative’s cross-valley marriage and dispute talk across language lines fits this multilingual-contact pattern; however, identifying a specific language name or clan for 470–498 AD at the given coordinates is not historically retrievable. The described offerings/taboos align with the supplied religious profile of local ancestor and place-spirit rites tied to gardens, pigs, funerals, and healing, but specific ritual names/forms remain unverifiable for this time depth."
  - "Environmental hazard realism tied to the death scenario: the Central Range montane rain-forest environment (steep slopes, very high rainfall) is inherently landslip- and flash-flood-prone; repeated garden damage, path washouts, and a fatal tree-felling fall on wet clay/roots are consistent with known hazard dynamics of steep, wet highland terrain. No specific storm/flood event can be dated to 470–498 AD for this locality, so these should be read as plausible recurrent risks rather than datable historical incidents."

He was born in wet high country near the spine of New Guinea, where steep ridges pinched the valleys and rain could last for days. Nights cooled enough that the fire stayed lit. Houses stood on posts. Pigs shifted underneath, and smoke leaked out through the thatch.

He was the fifth of ten children. The house was always full. His father moved between garden plots, checked fences, cut brush, and carried scraps and greens to the pigs. His mother dug and planted, hauled wood and water, cooked, and kept small children from tumbling into the fire. They lived like most households nearby: gardens that carried them in ordinary seasons, pigs enough to join exchanges, no family with a name people repeated.

As a boy he stayed back. He did not push into the best places and he did not talk over others. When older children fought, he watched. When adults spoke, he kept his eyes down and listened. People stopped asking what he thought. He did not try to fix that. When he was pleased his face barely changed. When he was angry he held it and then said something short that cut.

In his tenth year the wet season kept going past the time it usually broke. Paths turned to slick clay. One night a slope above one of their gardens slid. In the morning the family stood at the edge of torn ground where a row of plants had been. His mother set aside cooked food and placed it at the edge of the raw earth. She spoke to the place the way she spoke at graves.

His father cut new stakes and started again on higher ground. The boy carried planting material and fence posts until his shoulders burned. He said nothing. He watched which relatives blamed his father for cutting too close to the slope and which defended him. He kept track.

He grew into work that had clear limits. When men cleared new ground, he chose steady tasks: trimming vines, stacking brush, setting posts straight. He watched how a fence sagged when stakes were shallow. He watched where water ran after a downpour and where it ate a path from underneath. He did not offer advice unless someone asked. When he was told to do something, he did it the same way each time, and he did not forget what he had been told.

Marriage and exchange pulled people across language lines. The nearest valley spoke differently. He learned enough of that speech to trade and to follow dispute talk. He learned it by listening and repeating when he had to. He used it to answer questions without giving more than he meant to.

In his late teens pigs began dying in the area. People first talked about it after one household’s animals went quiet and stopped feeding. Within weeks other pens were thin. Pigs that normally shoved for scraps lay still and breathed hard. The sounds under houses changed from constant pushing to long stretches of silence. Men argued about broken taboos and who had brought trouble close.

His father counted what they had lost. With fewer pigs every promise tightened: compensation after injury, a gift to smooth a quarrel, a payment to stop words turning into weapons. Meals were watched. Plans were cut down. When a cousin asked for feed and help, his father gave it anyway. Later, when their own pen needed help, that cousin did not return it. The young man did not complain. He stored it.

As he entered manhood, tension thickened along the paths. Men carried bows and heavy clubs more often. Injuries were discussed in low voices, with lists of debts and old insults recited like proof. He avoided the center of crowds, but he listened at the edge and learned how people built a case: which names they called on, which past gifts they dragged forward, which silences meant refusal.

His manner made him useful and unpleasant. People trusted him with information because he did not spread it around. They watched him because he did not soften his words. During a compensation talk held under the eaves of a house, a man laid out a payment meant to end the matter cheaply. Everyone there knew it. The young man said, flatly, that it was small.

The talk stopped. Faces turned toward him. His father cut him off with a look. He dropped his eyes and said no more. After that he was kept on the outer tasks when men gathered: tying pigs, carrying wood, fetching water. No one wanted his voice in the middle.

In his early twenties he left his birth hamlet and walked into a nearby valley. It was a day on foot, but it meant different ground, different debts, and people who did not know his habits. He married there. He and his wife lived as a couple in their own small house near her kin. They had no children.

People spoke about it openly at pig killings and at funerals. They said it within hearing, not to him, the way people speak about something they think cannot be changed. He never answered. He worked longer days. He kept the pig pen clean. He kept his face still.

A dispute rose over a garden edge and a pig that broke through a fence. The pig belonged to his household. The other man counted the damage high and demanded more than the loss. He did not soothe and he did not joke. He challenged the count piece by piece, in a level voice that made the other man feel laughed at.

Relatives were pulled in. Old grievances were dragged forward to make the present claim heavier. For several days every visit carried the argument inside it. Meals were eaten with the dispute sitting between people.

Older men brought both sides onto open ground. They named the payment and required public reconciliation. His household paid with food and pork from a butchered pig. Hands were clasped in front of witnesses. He stood through it without changing his expression. When it was done he walked home without turning his head toward the other man. He did not forget the stare he felt on his back.

In his mid-twenties he worked toward a large exchange that renewed alliances and cooled talk of violence. For weeks people prepared. Pigs were fed carefully. Bundles were tied and checked and retied. On the day, groups arrived along muddy tracks, pigs tugging against fiber cords, greetings thrown across the clearing.

He stayed close to his own kin and kept to direct work: holding pigs, cutting, hauling water, tending fires. When arguments flared at the edge of the crowd, he watched which men calmed them and which men fed them. He watched who spoke first and who waited until others were tired. He learned the shape of promises, how they were said so they could be repeated later in the same words.

Rain stayed heavy as he moved through his twenties. A flash flood tore through a side creek and stripped out part of a path. Stones and broken wood lay in a raw line where people usually walked. Visits narrowed. Exchange travel thinned.

Then a hunter found an animal dead near a garden with no clear wound. People talked about it the way they talked about pig sickness: not as a single thing, but as a sign that something had slipped. A few days later, another misfortune followed close behind. Older people began naming taboos.

Foods were avoided. Certain places were left alone. Work in a few patches was delayed until small offerings were made. His wife’s kin kept count of who obeyed and who did not. He followed every rule without argument. Rules ended fights. He did not claim fear and he did not mock anyone else’s.

Near the end of his twenty-seventh year he went with other men to open a new patch for a garden. The forest was wet. The ground held a slick skin of leaves over roots and clay. They chose a tall straight tree and cut it low, opening a notch, listening for the change in sound that said the trunk had started to go.

When it moved, a warning was shouted. He stepped back, but his foot slid on a wet root. He tried to shift his weight and found nothing that held. The slope dropped away. The tree came faster than he expected, pulled and twisted by vines in its crown.

The blow drove the air out of him. The men dragged him along the half-cut path, hands and knees packed with mud. His wife met them at the edge of the hamlet. He did not speak again. Rain kept falling through the afternoon.

He died that day.
