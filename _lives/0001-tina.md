historical_notes:
  - "Long before 470 AD, New Guinea’s highlands already had intensive agriculture: at Kuk Swamp (near Mount Hagen), archaeologists have found drainage ditches and planting features dated to roughly 7,000–6,500 years ago, among the earliest known evidence for agriculture anywhere."
  - "Pigs were introduced to Near Oceania thousands of years earlier via human movement from Island Southeast Asia, and by the later Holocene they had become a central form of wealth for exchange, ritual, and settling disputes in many highland societies."
  - "In the first millennium AD, sweet potato was not yet in New Guinea (it arrived from the Americas after 1500 AD); staple carbohydrates in the 5th century were more likely taro, yams, bananas, and sago."
  - "New Guinea is one of the most linguistically diverse places on Earth (over 800 languages today), and neighboring valleys can differ sharply; local bilingualism could matter more than any long-distance trade language."
  - "Even without coins, compensation and alliance-making often had real ‘prices’ denominated in pigs, shells, and labor days; a pig mortality episode could wipe out households’ main store of savings and derail planned payments."
  - "In the wider regional timeline, 470–498 AD is centuries after the Lapita expansion in the Pacific (~1600–500 BC) and long before European arrival; coastal trade networks existed, but many interior highlanders likely encountered the outside world mostly through goods and stories moving along chains of exchange."

He was born in wet high country near the spine of New Guinea, where ridges narrowed the valleys and rain could hold for days. Nights went cold enough that the fire stayed in. Their house stood on posts above the ground. Smoke leaked through the thatch and clung to hair and bedding. Pigs were kept close, penned and tied near the houses, loud at feeding time and restless when strangers came.

He was the fifth of ten children. The house was loud and short on space. His father moved between garden plots, checked fences, cut brush, and hauled greens for the pigs. His mother dug and planted, carried water and wood, cooked, and kept small children away from the hearth. They lived like most people around them: enough sweet potato and greens in ordinary seasons, pigs enough to join exchanges, no name that traveled farther than the next ridge.

As a boy he stayed back. He did not push into the middle of games and he did not talk over others. When older children fought, he watched. When adults spoke, he kept his eyes down and listened. Questions brought little from him. People stopped asking.

His face gave nothing away. When he was pleased it barely showed. When he was angry he held it until it came out in one short sentence. He did not take words back. He did not soften them.

When he was ten the rain did not lift when it should have. Paths turned to slick clay. A slope above one of their gardens broke loose in the night. In the morning they stood at torn ground where a row of plants had been. His mother set aside cooked food and placed it at the edge of the raw earth. She spoke to the place the way she spoke at graves, naming what had happened and ordering it to settle.

His father cut new stakes and started again higher up. The boy carried planting pieces and fence posts until his shoulders burned. He watched which relatives blamed his father for cutting too close to the slope and which defended him. He remembered who spoke first, and who stayed quiet until the talk had turned.

He grew into work that had clear edges. When men opened new ground, he chose steady tasks: trimming vines, stacking brush, setting posts straight. He watched how fences failed when stakes were shallow. He watched where water ran after a downpour and where it cut from underneath. He did not offer advice unless someone demanded it. When he was told to do something, he did it the same way every time. If challenged, he repeated the exact words he had been given.

People crossed into the next valley for visits, payments, and marriages. The nearest valley spoke differently. He learned enough of that speech to follow dispute talk and to trade food and pig fat without being cheated. He learned it by listening. He used it to answer questions without giving more than he meant to.

In his later teens pigs began dying in the valley. It started with one household’s animals going quiet and turning away from food. Within weeks other households were losing them too. Pigs that normally shoved for scraps lay still and breathed hard. Near the houses the constant grunting thinned into long stretches of silence. Men argued about broken rules and who had dragged trouble close.

His father counted what they lost. With fewer pigs every promise tightened: a payment after an injury, a gift to cool a quarrel, pork to settle a hard word before it turned into a blow. Meals were watched. Visits became shorter. People started measuring each other.

A cousin came asking for feed and help. His father gave it. Later, when their own pigs were failing, that cousin turned his face away and said his household was also short. The young man said nothing in front of others. He carried it and held it like a debt.

As he entered manhood, tension thickened along the paths. Men carried bows and heavy clubs more often. Injuries were discussed in low voices, with old insults and old gifts recited to make the present heavier. He avoided the center of crowds, but he listened at the edge and learned how words were used: which names were called up, which debts were counted again, which silences meant refusal.

His manner made him useful and disliked. People trusted him with talk because he did not repeat it. They watched him because he did not ease anything. When he spoke, it landed and stayed where it fell.

During a settlement talk held under the eaves of a house, a man laid out a payment meant to end a dispute cheaply. Everyone there saw it. The young man said, flat, that it was small.

The talk stopped. Faces turned. His father cut him off with a look sharp enough to end it. He dropped his eyes and did not speak again. After that he was kept on outer tasks when men gathered: tying pigs, hauling wood, fetching water. No one wanted his voice in the middle.

In his early twenties he left his birth hamlet and walked into a nearby valley. It was a day on foot, but it meant different ground, different debts, and people who had not learned his habits. He married there. He and his wife lived as a couple in a small house near her kin.

They waited for children and none came. Women talked while they stripped greens and scraped tubers. Men spoke over fires after pork was shared. They said it within hearing, not to him. His wife’s relatives watched him for anger, for shame, for a gift that would ask for help. He gave none. He rose early, stayed late in the gardens, and kept his pig pen clean. When spoken to, he answered and went back to work.

A dispute rose over a garden edge and a pig that broke through a fence. The pig belonged to his household. The other man counted the damage high and demanded more than the loss. The young man did not soothe and he did not joke. He challenged the count piece by piece, in a level voice that made the other man feel mocked.

Relatives were pulled in. Older grudges were brought forward to thicken the claim. For days every visit carried the argument inside it. Meals were eaten with the dispute sitting between people.

Older men brought both sides onto open ground. They named the payment and required both households to clasp hands in front of witnesses. His household paid with food and pork from a pig they killed and cut up for the settlement. He stood through it without a change in his face. When it ended he walked home without turning his head toward the other man.

In his mid-twenties he worked toward a large exchange meant to renew ties and cool the talk of fighting. For weeks people prepared. Pigs were fed carefully. Bundles of food were tied and checked and tied again. On the day, groups came in along muddy tracks, pigs tugging against fiber cords, greetings thrown across the clearing.

He stayed close to his wife’s kin and kept to direct work: holding pigs, hauling water, tending fires, carrying loads to where they were counted. When arguments rose at the edge of the crowd, he watched which men quieted them and which men sharpened them. He listened to promises said in set phrases so they could be repeated later without change.

The rain stayed heavy through his twenties. A flash flood tore through a side creek and stripped out part of the path. Stones and broken wood lay in a raw line where people usually walked. Travel narrowed. Small exchanges were delayed. Households leaned harder on nearby kin and watched their stores.

An animal was found dead near the gardens with no clear wound. Older people named it and did not laugh. They said rules had slipped and the land had noticed. In the days that followed mishaps came close together: a man fell on a wet track and split his shin, a child’s fever rose fast, a pig refused food and lay with its eyes half shut. The talk turned from blame to ritual.

Foods were avoided. Certain places were left alone. Work in a few garden patches stopped until offerings were made and words were said in the right order. His wife’s kin watched who obeyed and who treated it as a joke. He obeyed every rule without argument. He did it the way he did everything: exact, closed, and without looking at anyone.

Those held-back patches left households short. Men chose a new site on a steep slope where tall trees stood close together. Near the end of his twenty-seventh year he went with them to open it.

The forest was wet. Leaves made a slick skin over roots and clay. They chose a straight tree and cut it low, opening a notch. Men listened for the change in sound that meant the trunk had started to go. Vines in the crown held it a moment longer than it should have.

When it moved, someone shouted a warning. He stepped back, but his foot slid on a wet root. He tried to shift his weight and found nothing that held. The slope dropped away. The tree came faster than he expected, pulled and twisted by the vines.

The blow drove the air out of him. Men dragged him along the half-cut path, hands and knees packed with mud. His wife met them at the edge of the hamlet. He did not speak again. Rain kept falling through the afternoon.

He died that day.
