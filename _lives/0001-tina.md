historical_notes:
  - "Highland farming in New Guinea is extremely old: at Kuk Swamp near Mount Hagen, field drains and cultivation features date back about 9,000 years (to around 7,000 BC)."
  - "In the 400s AD, the New Guinea Highlands had no kingdoms, coins, or writing; people lived in small, kin-based hamlets connected by exchange and marriage ties."
  - "Papua New Guinea is one of the most language-dense places on Earth: today it has 800+ languages, and in many highland areas a neighboring valley may speak a different language."
  - "Large highland exchange cycles could involve hundreds to thousands of pigs; in the best-known Enga-style tee exchanges, households may raise pigs for years for a single major event."
  - "The Highlands stayed outside Christianity much longer than many parts of the world: sustained mission and government presence in interior highland areas expanded mainly from the 1930s to 1950s."
  - "For the Nipa/Southern Highlands in the 400s AD, archaeology cannot usually pin down named groups or specific local events year by year, so many details must be reconstructed from broader Highland patterns."

He was born in wet high country near the spine of New Guinea, where ridges narrowed the valleys and rain could hold for days. Nights went cold enough that the fire stayed in. Their houses stood up on posts to keep the floor above the wet ground. Pigs were kept close, fenced beneath the house and tied off when they grew restless. Smoke leaked through the thatch and clung to everyone’s hair.

He was the fifth of ten children. The house was loud and short on space. His father moved between garden plots, checked fences, cut brush, and hauled greens to the pigs. His mother dug and planted, carried water and wood, cooked, and kept small children from stumbling into the hearth. They lived like most people around them: enough sweet potato and greens in ordinary seasons, pigs enough to take part in exchanges, no story that carried beyond the local paths.

As a boy he stayed back. He did not push into the middle of games and he did not talk over others. When older children fought, he watched. When adults spoke, he kept his eyes down and listened. People learned that asking him questions brought little back. They stopped trying.

His face did not help. When he was pleased it barely showed. When he was angry he held it until it came out in one short sentence. He did not take words back and he did not soften them.

When he was ten the rain did not lift when it usually did. Paths turned to slick clay. One night a slope above one of their gardens broke loose. In the morning they stood at torn ground where a row of plants had been. His mother set aside cooked food and placed it at the edge of the raw earth. She spoke to the place the way she spoke at graves, naming what had happened and asking it to stop.

His father cut new stakes and started again higher up. The boy carried planting pieces and fence posts until his shoulders burned. He watched which relatives blamed his father for cutting too close to the slope and which defended him. He remembered who spoke first, and who stayed quiet until the talk had turned.

He grew into work that had clear edges. When men opened new ground, he chose steady tasks: trimming vines, stacking brush, setting posts straight. He watched how fences failed when stakes were shallow. He watched where water ran after a downpour and where it cut a path from underneath. He did not offer advice unless someone demanded it. When he was told to do something, he did it the same way every time, and he repeated the exact words back if he was challenged.

Marriage and exchange pulled people across language lines. The nearest valley spoke differently. He learned enough of that speech to trade and to follow quarrel talk. He learned it by listening. He used it to answer questions without giving more than he meant to.

In his later teens pigs began dying in the valley. It started with one household’s animals going quiet and turning away from food. Within weeks other households were losing them too. Pigs that normally shoved for scraps lay still and breathed hard. Under and beside the houses the constant grunting thinned into long stretches of silence. Men argued about rules that had been broken and who had brought trouble close.

His father counted what they lost. With fewer pigs every promise tightened: a payment after an injury, a gift to cool a quarrel, pork to settle a hard word before it turned into a blow. Meals were watched. Visits became shorter. People started measuring each other.

A cousin came asking for feed and help. His father gave it. Later, when their own pigs were failing, that cousin turned his face away and said his household was also short. The young man said nothing in front of others. He did not forgive it either. He carried it and held it like a debt.

As he entered manhood, tension thickened along the paths. Men carried bows and heavy clubs more often. Injuries were discussed in low voices, with old insults and old gifts recited to make the present heavier. He avoided the center of crowds, but he listened at the edge and learned how words were used: which names were called up, which debts were counted again, which silences meant refusal.

His manner made him useful and disliked. People trusted him with talk because he did not repeat it. They also watched him because he did not ease anything. When he spoke, it landed and stayed where it fell.

During a settlement talk held under the eaves of a house, a man laid out a payment meant to end a dispute cheaply. Everyone there saw it. The young man said, flat, that it was small.

The talk stopped. Faces turned. His father cut him off with a look sharp enough to end it. He dropped his eyes and did not speak again. After that he was kept on outer tasks when men gathered: tying pigs, carrying wood, fetching water. No one wanted his voice in the middle.

In his early twenties he left his birth hamlet and walked into a nearby valley. It was a day on foot, but it meant different ground, different debts, and people who had not learned his habits. He married there. He and his wife lived as a couple in a small house near her kin. They had no children.

People spoke about it at pig killings and funerals. They did not hide their mouths. They said it within hearing, not to him. He never answered. He worked longer days. He kept the pig place clean. He kept his face still.

A dispute rose over a garden edge and a pig that broke through a fence. The pig belonged to his household. The other man counted the damage high and demanded more than the loss. The young man did not soothe and he did not joke. He challenged the count piece by piece, in a level voice that made the other man feel mocked.

Relatives were pulled in. Older grudges were brought forward to thicken the claim. For days every visit carried the argument inside it. Meals were eaten with the dispute sitting between people.

Older men brought both sides onto open ground. They named the payment and required both households to clasp hands in front of witnesses. His household paid with food and pork from a butchered pig. He stood through it without a change in his face. When it ended he walked home without turning his head toward the other man.

In his mid-twenties he worked toward a large exchange meant to renew ties and cool the talk of fighting. For weeks people prepared. Pigs were fed carefully. Bundles of food were tied and checked and tied again. On the day, groups came in along muddy tracks, pigs tugging against fiber cords, greetings thrown across the clearing.

He stayed close to his own kin and kept to direct work: holding pigs, cutting, hauling water, tending fires. When arguments rose at the edge of the crowd, he watched which men quieted them and which men sharpened them. He listened to promises said in set phrases so they could be repeated later without change.

The rain stayed heavy through his twenties. A flash flood tore through a side creek and stripped out part of the path. Stones and broken wood lay in a raw line where people usually walked. Travel narrowed. Small exchanges were delayed. Households leaned harder on nearby kin.

Then an animal was found dead near the gardens with no clear wound. Older people named it and did not laugh. They said rules had slipped and the land had noticed. In the days that followed mishaps came close together: a man fell on a wet track and split his shin, a child’s fever rose fast, a pig refused food and lay with its eyes half shut. The talk turned from blame to ritual.

Foods were avoided. Certain places were left alone. Work in a few garden patches was stopped until offerings were made and words were said in the right order. His wife’s kin watched who obeyed and who treated it as a joke. He obeyed every rule without argument. He did not do it gently. He did it the way he did everything: exact, closed, and without looking at anyone.

Those held-back patches left households short. To make up for it, men chose a new site on a steep slope where tall trees stood close together. Near the end of his twenty-seventh year he went with them to open it.

The forest was wet. Leaves made a slick skin over roots and clay. They chose a straight tree and cut it low, opening a notch. Men listened for the change in sound that meant the trunk had started to go. Vines in the crown held it a moment longer than it should have.

When it moved, someone shouted a warning. He stepped back, but his foot slid on a wet root. He tried to shift his weight and found nothing that held. The slope dropped away. The tree came faster than he expected, pulled and twisted by the vines.

The blow drove the air out of him. Men dragged him along the half-cut path, hands and knees packed with mud. His wife met them at the edge of the hamlet. He did not speak again. Rain kept falling through the afternoon.

He died that day.
