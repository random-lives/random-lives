Tina was born in the wet high country near the spine of New Guinea, in a place of steep ridges and narrow valleys where rain could last for days. The nights cooled enough for a fire to matter. Houses sat above the ground. Under them pigs shifted and squealed, and smoke worked its way out through the roof.

He was the fifth of ten children. The house stayed full of noise and small demands. His father spent most days moving between garden plots, checking fences, cutting brush, and carrying feed to the pigs. His mother dug and planted, hauled wood and water, cooked, and kept children away from the fire. They lived like most households around them: enough food in ordinary seasons, enough pigs to take part in exchanges, no special name.

Tina grew into a boy who stayed back. He did not press into the best places or talk over other people. When older children argued, he watched and kept quiet. When adults spoke, he kept his eyes down and listened as if he were learning a tool. People forgot to ask what he thought. That suited him. When he was pleased, his face barely changed. When he was angry, he held it and then said something sharp and small that landed harder than a shout.

Heavy rain marked his childhood. In his tenth year the wet season did not break when it should have. Paths turned to slick clay. One night a slope above one of their gardens slid. In the morning the family stood at the edge of torn ground where a row of plants had been. His mother set aside cooked food and placed it at the edge of the scar, speaking to the place as if it could hear. His father cut new stakes and started replanting on higher ground. Tina carried loads of planting material and fence posts until his shoulders burned. He said nothing. He also noticed which relatives blamed his father for clearing too close to the slope, and which defended him. He kept those names in his head.

As he grew, he took to work that had clear limits. When men cleared new ground, he chose the steady tasks: trimming vines, stacking brush, setting posts straight. He watched how a fence would sag if the stakes were set shallow. He watched where water ran after a downpour and how it undermined a path. He rarely volunteered opinions, but when he was given a task he did it the same way every time, and he did not forget.

Marriage ties and exchange ran across language lines in the highlands. People from the nearest valley spoke differently. Tina learned enough of that neighboring speech to trade and to follow dispute talk. He learned it by listening and repeating without forcing himself into conversation. He used it to answer questions and to avoid giving away more than he had to.

In his late teens a sickness moved through the pigs. It started in one house and spread along the ridges. Pigs that normally fought for scraps lay still and breathed hard. The sounds under houses changed from constant pushing to long quiet. People argued over the cause and watched each other for signs of broken taboo. Tina watched his father count what they had lost. With fewer pigs, every promise became harder: payments after injury, exchange gifts, the means to end a quarrel without a spear.

The household tightened. Meals were watched. Plans were trimmed down. When a cousin asked for feed and help, Tina’s father gave it, even with their own pen thin. Tina did not argue. He remembered that the cousin did not bring anything back when their pen needed it later.

As Tina entered manhood, tensions rose in the valley. Men carried bows and heavy clubs more often when they walked the paths. Injuries were discussed in low voices, with lists of debts and old insults. Tina avoided crowds, but he listened at the edge and learned how people built a case: which names were invoked, which past gifts were counted as leverage, which silences meant refusal.

His manner made him useful and unpleasant. People trusted him with information because he did not gossip. They also watched him because he did not soften his words. During a settlement talk over an injury, a man offered a payment that everyone knew was meant to close the matter cheap. Tina said, flatly, that it was small. The room went still. His father corrected him with a look. Tina dropped his eyes and stopped speaking. After that he was kept away from the center of talks.

In his early twenties he left his birth hamlet and moved into a nearby valley. The distance was a day’s walk, but it meant new garden ground, new obligations, and a different set of eyes on him. He married there. He and his wife lived as a couple in their own small house near her kin. They had no children. No one treated it as a mystery; it was a fact that drew comments at pig killings and at funerals. Tina did not answer those comments. He worked longer days, kept the pig pen clean, and kept his face still.

A dispute rose over a garden boundary and a pig that broke through a fence. The pig belonged to Tina’s household. The other man counted the damage high and demanded more than the loss. Tina did not smile or soothe. He challenged the count point by point, in a level voice that made the other man feel mocked. The argument pulled in relatives. People repeated old grievances to strengthen the present claim. For several days, every visit and every shared meal carried the dispute in it.

Older men brought both sides together on open ground. They set the terms, named a payment, and required public reconciliation. Tina’s household paid: food and a share of pork from a butchered pig. Hands were clasped in front of witnesses. Tina stood through it without changing his expression. When it was done, he walked home without turning his head toward the other man. He did not forget the stare he received back.

In his mid-twenties he worked toward a major exchange gathering that renewed alliances and lowered the risk of violence. For weeks people prepared. Pigs were fattened. Bundles were tied. On the day, groups arrived along muddy tracks, guiding pigs with fiber cords and calling greetings across the clearing. Tina stayed close to his own kin. He kept to tasks that were direct: holding pigs, cutting, hauling water, tending fires. When disputes flared at the edge of the crowd, he watched the men who calmed them and the men who fed them. He learned who spoke first, who waited, and how a promise was shaped so it could be repeated later.

The rains did not ease as he approached his late twenties. A flash flood tore through a side creek and stripped out part of a path. Stones and broken wood lay in a raw line where people usually walked. Travel and visits narrowed. That season a dead animal was found near a garden without marks, and a tree fell across a path in clear weather. People treated it as a warning. Taboos were announced and kept: foods avoided, paths taken and not taken, work delayed in certain places. Tina followed the rules because rules ended arguments. He did not claim fear, and he did not mock the fear of others.

On September 18, 498, Tina went with other men to clear a new patch for a garden. The forest was heavy with wet. The ground held a skin of slick leaves over roots and clay. They chose a tall straight tree and cut it low, opening a notch, listening for the first change in the sound of the trunk.

When the tree began to move, a warning was shouted. Tina stepped back, but his foot slid on a wet root. He tried to shift his weight and found no purchase. The slope dropped away. The trunk fell fast, pulled by vines tangled in its crown.

The blow ended his breath. The men dragged him along the half-cut path they had opened, their hands and knees packed with mud. His wife met them at the edge of the hamlet. Tina did not speak again. Rain kept falling through the afternoon.
