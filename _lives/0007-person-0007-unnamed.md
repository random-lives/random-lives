He was never given a formal name. His grandmother called him “the little one” when she rose from the hearth and checked the mat beside his mother.

He was born on a cold morning after the first winter nights had settled in. Their household lived near a shallow well outside a small scatter of huts and thorn pens on the dry plain. Three generations shared the yard: his father and uncles, his grandfather, the women, and the other children. His father worked the animals—mostly goats, with a few cattle—and kept a small patch for grain when the rains left enough damp ground. His mother kept the fire going, ground grain, carried water, and shaped dung into cakes to dry.

In this house people used more than one speech. His mother spoke in the words she had grown up with when she talked with the older women. When she addressed her husband in front of his father she switched to the speech his line favored, the one heard from men who moved with herds and traded beyond the local wells.

The baby came early and stayed small. He tired before he could take enough milk. His mother tried again and again, holding him to her breast until his mouth slipped away. When he would not suck, she pressed out milk into a small clay scoop and tipped it into his mouth in drops. He slept through hunger. His wrists stayed thin and loose-skinned, and his limbs cooled fast at night.

After a few weeks his cry weakened and then failed. Before the sun climbed high they wrapped him in a cloth and carried him beyond the pens. They did not hold the household rite in which they spoke a name over a child and set out a small offering at the edge of the yard. He was buried without it.
