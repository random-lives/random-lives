# Sex: M
# Sexual orientation: heterosexual
# adult_standing: Free commoner of typical standing (roughly same status as birth household)
# birth_order_position: 3
# cause_of_death: Age-related frailty/degenerative decline (general 'old age', wasting,
#   organ failure without a single clear acute event)
# ethnicity: Illyrian-influenced group on the Pannonian–Illyrian frontier (southern
#   cultural ties)
# father_occupation: Mixed farmer-herder (subsistence agriculture plus livestock/woodland
#   use; primary household head)
# historical_context:
# - event: 'Intensification of Hallstatt-period exchange networks: greater circulation
#     of prestige goods (metalwork, salt, ornaments) and the social power of local chiefs/warrior
#     elites, increasing demands for labor, livestock contributions, and participation
#     in communal projects/retinues.'
#   timing: adolescence to mid-adulthood (c. ages 12–45; 584–551 BC)
# - event: Periodic frontier raiding/feud cycles between neighboring communities (over
#     pasture/stock/routes), producing intermittent insecurity, temporary refuge-taking,
#     and occasional loss of stored food or animals at the district level even without
#     full-scale conquest.
#   timing: most likely in young adulthood and midlife (c. ages 18–50; 578–546 BC)
# - event: Climate variability causing at least one multi-season subsistence stress
#     (cool/wet harvest failure or summer drought), leading to poorer grain yields,
#     higher reliance on acorns/forest foods, and increased slaughter of livestock.
#   timing: any time, but most consequential in prime working years (c. ages 20–55;
#     576–541 BC)
# - event: Severe winter(s) with deep frost/snow episodes affecting fodder and animal
#     survival (loss of small stock, forced early slaughter, higher spring hunger).
#   timing: recurrent risk across adulthood (c. ages 25–70; 571–526 BC)
# - event: Livestock disease episode (especially among cattle or pigs) spreading through
#     local herds and reducing traction/manure and household wealth in an agro-pastoral
#     economy.
#   timing: midlife most impactful (c. ages 30–60; 566–536 BC)
# - event: Spread/availability of iron tools and weapons relative to bronze, gradually
#     changing farming efficiency (axes, sickles) and the lethality of conflict; adoption
#     uneven and mediated by access to smiths and exchange.
#   timing: childhood through adulthood (c. ages 5–50; 591–546 BC)
# household_social_status: Free commoner household (ordinary farming/herding family
#   with customary rights to land/pasture)
# household_structure_at_birth: Stem-family household (parents plus one grandparent/elder
#   relative; otherwise mostly nuclear)
# household_structure_at_death: Alone (solitary household, perhaps with neighbors/kin
#   nearby but not co-resident)
# language: Paleo-Balkan Indo-European (neighboring Pannonian/Western Balkan dialect
#   continuum; not clearly separable from 'Illyrian')
# literacy: Illiterate (cannot read or write)
# marital_status: Never married
# mental_disorder: No clear mental disorder likely (within normal range of functioning
#   for the time/place)
# migration: Stayed local (spent adult life in the same settlement area; moves only
#   within the local district)
# mother_occupation: Household producer and caregiver (childrearing, food processing,
#   textile work; assists with farming as needed)
# narrative_plan:
#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: -545
#     name: Skeron
#     narrative_role: 'Mixed farmer-herder; firm but not cruel. Relationship is respect-based:
#       he praises Pleuron’s diligence and reliability, and expects him to show up for
#       communal labor and defense.'
#     role: father
#   - death_year: -554
#     name: Arban
#     narrative_role: Household producer (food processing, textiles, childcare). Relationship
#       is close and anxiety-tinged due to repeated infant deaths; she leans on Pleuron
#       as a dependable helper.
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: -572
#     name: Monun
#     narrative_role: Elder woman present at Pleuron’s birth (stem-family). Taught ritual
#       propriety (offerings at grove, taboos around birth and winter). Relationship
#       warm but disciplinarian; her death coincides with Pleuron’s transition into
#       warband age.
#     role: paternal grandmother (elder in stem-family household)
#   children: []
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 20
#     connection: Occurs soon after grandmother Monun’s death; Pleuron channels grief
#       and restlessness into warband duty and gains ties to local leaders.
#     incident: military_service
#   - age: 22
#     connection: Retaliatory raid follows cycles of feud; reinforces the community’s
#       emphasis on watchfulness and pushes Pleuron toward harsher stances in boundary
#       disputes.
#     incident: civilian_war_exposure
#   - age: 24
#     connection: Happens at a communal sacrifice/feast at the hilltop grove; establishes
#       a personal grudge that later frames his willingness to use violence.
#     incident: physical_assault
#   - age: 27
#     connection: Escalation of the same network of pasture and water-right disputes;
#       supported by lineage solidarity and his high extraversion (he rallies others
#       quickly).
#     incident: physical_assault_perp
#   - age: 29
#     connection: A lean winter after subsistence stress; his lower honesty-humility
#       shows in rationalizing the theft as 'boundary strays' and prioritizing household
#       survival.
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   - age: 33
#     connection: Autumn pig-mast season; theft likely retaliatory in the ongoing boundary
#       feud context; dispute before elders shows local informal 'justice' limits.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 41
#     connection: During midlife house maintenance; aftermath increases dependence on
#       siblings/nieces and may contribute to remaining unmarried (reduced ability to
#       found an independent household).
#     incident: serious_accident
#   - age: 58
#     connection: Begins after accumulated winter illnesses weaken Varis; also coincides
#       with shrinking sibling set, pushing Pleuron into a central kin-care role.
#     incident: sick_relative
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-7
#     key_events:
#     - Raised in a stem-family yard-house with grandmother Monun; early learning centers
#       on livestock routines, wood gathering, and ritual etiquette.
#     - Household grief and caution shaped by the deaths of infant siblings (Bato, Gento,
#       later Sarnus).
#     - Learns boundary knowledge (fields, stream crossings, oak woods) by trailing
#       older sister Varis.
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 8-17
#     key_events:
#     - Begins serious herding responsibilities and seasonal field labor; becomes known
#       as dependable and orderly.
#     - Delmon (younger sister) dies at 14 when Pleuron is about 17, sharpening his
#       sense of duty and fear of bad winters.
#     - 'Hallstatt-style exchange intensifies locally: visits by traders/smiths; community
#       obligations to chiefs become more visible.'
#     phase: Later childhood and adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-30
#     key_events:
#     - Joins seasonal levy/warband service; gains status and scars, and learns discipline
#       and group loyalty.
#     - Experiences raid pressure on the district (hayricks burned, cattle driven off);
#       community organizes refuge and watch.
#     - Becomes enmeshed in boundary disputes and violence; also commits a discreet
#       stock-theft during a lean winter.
#     phase: Young adulthood
#   - age_range: 31-50
#     key_events:
#     - Deepens role as mixed farmer-herder; manages pigs in oak woods, hay meadows,
#       and winter fodder planning.
#     - Suffers a serious logging accident while repairing roof timber; recovery shifts
#       his role toward planning/coordination more than heavy labor.
#     - Loses pigs to theft and fails to fully recover them, souring relations with
#       a neighboring kin-group.
#     phase: Mid-adulthood
#   - age_range: 51-76
#     key_events:
#     - Caregiving period for older sister Varis during prolonged illness; coordinates
#       kin support and provisioning.
#     - Deaths of close kin (Kentor at 52; Lator at 50; Varis at 60) erode co-residence
#       options; he increasingly keeps a small solitary dwelling/annex near kin lands.
#     - Ends life alone with gradual frailty; remains socially connected but without
#       a household of his own.
#     phase: Later adulthood and old age
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Plator
#     prominence: young adulthood (c. ages 18–32) and referenced later as a contrast
#       to Pleuron’s steadier habits
#     relationship: older cousin and occasional partner-in-necessary-crime; involved
#       in the goat theft; also a warband contact
#   - name: Dasion
#     prominence: young adulthood through mid-adulthood (c. ages 23–35)
#     relationship: rival hamlet herdsman associated with boundary disputes; part of
#       the network behind the grove-feast fight and later tensions
#   - name: Bricus
#     prominence: adolescence through mid-adulthood (c. ages 14–45)
#     relationship: local smith/trader intermediary who brings iron tools and news;
#       occasional debtor/creditor relationship in goods
#   - name: Verzo
#     prominence: mid-adulthood (c. ages 30–45)
#     relationship: elder/mediator who sits in dispute meetings (including the pig-theft
#       argument); represents community norms and compensation practices
#   partners:
#   - name: Scenon
#     narrative_role: Brief, informal relationship with a young woman from a nearby
#       hamlet; ends due to kin objections/uncertain bridewealth and Pleuron’s lack
#       of commitment to forming his own household (contributes to never-married status).

#     name: Varis
#     narrative_role: Older sister and early anchor figure; as the eldest surviving
#       child she helped raise Pleuron, later becomes the sick relative he cares for
#       in his late 50s/early 60s; their bond is practical, affectionate, and sometimes

#     death_year: -594
#     name: Gento
#     narrative_role: Infant loss that reinforces the household’s fear of bad seasons

#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -590
#     death_age: 1
#     death_year: -589
#     name: Sarnus
#     narrative_role: Toddler death; contributes to a household atmosphere where adults
#       assume some children will not survive, shaping Pleuron’s anxious vigilance (mildly
#       elevated neuroticism).
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -588
#     death_age: 52
#     death_year: -536
#     name: Kentor
#     narrative_role: Younger brother, closest male peer in adulthood; co-worker in

#       60s pushes Pleuron toward living more alone.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: -586
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: -586
#     name: Tauton
#     narrative_role: Late infant loss; barely remembered except in ritual lists of
#       ancestors/kin when the family makes offerings.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -583
#     death_age: 50
#     death_year: -533
#     name: Lator
#     narrative_role: Youngest surviving sister; marries into a nearby hamlet and becomes
#       a key link for exchange/help; her death near the end of Pleuron’s caregiving
#       years further thins his household ties.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds reputation as reliable; elders entrust him with tasks (watch
#       rotations, shared pasture timing), but it also makes him rigid in disputes.
#     scene: He keeps careful seasonal routines—counting animals at dusk, repairing
#       fences before storms, insisting on grain drying and rodent-proofing stores even
#       when others want to feast.
#     timing: visible from adolescence through mid-adulthood (c. ages 12–50)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (84th percentile)
#   - consequence: Expands his social network and influence, but also draws him into
#       conflicts (the grove-feast beating; stream-crossing assault).
#     scene: At feasts and work-bees he speaks readily, mediates jokes and bargains,
#       and quickly gathers cousins for collective action—both for defense and for intimidation.
#     timing: young adulthood through later adulthood (c. ages 18–60)
#     trait: Extraversion (86th percentile)
#   - consequence: Short-term gains (meat in a lean winter, face-saving in disputes)
#       but long-term mistrust with a neighboring kin-group and a lingering reputation
#       for sharp dealing.
#     scene: He frames self-serving acts as practical necessity—claiming disputed goats
#       are 'strays,' minimizing his part in a beating, and using charm to sway elders’
#       opinions.
#     timing: young adulthood and midlife (c. ages 25–45)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility low (32nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Improves preparedness and vigilance, but increases strain in relationships
#       and makes him quick to interpret slights as threats.
#     scene: Before winter he becomes tense and irritable, repeatedly checks fodder
#       stacks and roof lashings, and sleeps lightly during periods of raid rumors.
#     timing: adolescence onward, spikes during raid years and late-winter shortages
#       (c. ages 15–40)
#     trait: Neuroticism moderately high (61st percentile)
# number_of_children: '0'
# number_of_siblings: '8'
# occupation: Mixed farmer-herder (household subsistence producer; fields, livestock,
#   woodland resources)
# religion: 'Local community cult at natural sacred sites (groves/springs/hilltops):
#   periodic feasting and animal sacrifice with the village/lineage'

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During late autumn, after driving pigs into the oak woods for mast, he returned
#     to find a neighbor’s kin had quietly cut his tether and taken two young pigs from
#     the edge of his enclosure; the dispute was argued before elders but the animals
#     were never fully recovered.
#   reasoning: In small agrarian communities, theft of livestock, tools, stored grain,
#     or robbery during travel/raids was common enough that a long-lived farmer-herder
#     had substantial exposure.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 33–34 (563–562 BC); single event
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: In a lean late winter when stores were low, he and an older cousin drove
#     off a small number of goats from a boundary pasture used by a rival hamlet, later
#     claiming they were strays; the animals were slaughtered quickly to avoid identification.
#   reasoning: Borderland subsistence economies had blurred lines around poaching, taking
#     wood/stock, or opportunistic theft; low honesty-humility increases likelihood
#     even for a generally stable commoner.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 29–30 (567–566 BC); single event
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime
# - event: After a drinking feast following a communal sacrifice at a hilltop grove,
#     an argument over grazing boundaries escalated and he was struck with a staff and
#     kicked, leaving him with cracked ribs and a bruised hip that kept him from heavy
#     work for weeks.
#   reasoning: As an adult male in a frontier community with feuding/raiding and communal
#     drinking/market disputes, being beaten or injured in a serious fight at least
#     once is the modal violent-victim pathway.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 24–25 (572–571 BC); single event
#   type: physical_assault
# - event: During a summer quarrel at a stream crossing where carts queued for water,
#     he and two men from his lineage cornered a rival herdsman and beat him with fists
#     and sticks for insulting an elder and encroaching on their hay meadow.
#   reasoning: Given perpetrator violence is confirmed, the most common form is participation
#     in fights/assaults (retaliation, disputes, defense/raids) that do not result in
#     death.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 27–28 (569–568 BC); single event
#   type: physical_assault_perp
# - event: While felling a beech on a slope to repair a roof frame, the trunk shifted
#     unexpectedly and pinned his lower leg; he survived but walked with pain and stiffness
#     afterward and relied on kin for the heaviest fieldwork during recovery.
#   reasoning: Mixed farming-herding and woodland work (axes, carts, livestock, falls)
#     frequently produced serious injuries that people sometimes survived with prolonged
#     recovery.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 41–42 (555–554 BC); single event with months-long incapacity
#   type: serious_accident
# - event: He took primary responsibility for an older sister who developed progressive
#     weakness and joint swelling after repeated winter illnesses, keeping her fed and
#     warm, fetching water and fuel, and arranging help with spinning and food processing
#     when he was away.
#   reasoning: In a kin-based household economy with little institutional care, prolonged
#     nursing of an injured/chronically ill relative was a common duty, especially for
#     an unmarried adult with fewer competing obligations.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 58–63 (538–533 BC); sustained period
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: As a young adult he served in a seasonal levy/warband raised by local leaders,
#     joining patrols and a raid along a river corridor; he carried a spear and shield
#     and helped guard livestock and captives on the return.
#   reasoning: Warfare was often organized as ad hoc warbands/levies rather than standing
#     armies; an able-bodied man likely participated in at least some armed defense
#     or raiding over decades.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 20–22 (576–574 BC); recurring seasonal duty over several months
#   type: military_service
# - event: 'A retaliatory raid reached his district: outlying hayricks were burned and
#     several cattle were driven off, and he spent nights in a hastily organized refuge
#     on higher ground while scouts watched for a second attack.'
#   reasoning: Even without formal service, raids could burn stores, force temporary
#     flight, or bring intimidation; local exposure is plausible in a frontier zone
#     but not guaranteed.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 22–23 (574–573 BC); sustained period (several weeks)
#   type: civilian_war_exposure
---

Pleuron was born the third child in a small cluster of yard-houses on the wooded edge of the Pannonian plain, where the fields broke into oak forest and wet meadows. His people spoke a local Paleo‑Balkan tongue and tied their kin groups together through pasture rights, bridewealth, and vengeance. Authority sat with elders and with the men who could gather followers for a raid or a defense. The sacred places were not buildings. They were groves on high ground, springs with stone rings, and old burial mounds where a family poured drink and set down food for the dead.

His father, Skeron, kept mixed land: cereal plots and legumes near the houses, hay meadows by the water, and pigs and cattle pushed into the forest when the season allowed. His mother, Arban, spun and wove, ground grain, salted meat, and carried babies while she worked. Pleuron entered a household already shaped by loss. An older brother, Bato, had died as an infant before Pleuron was born. When Pleuron was small, his younger brother Gento lived only long enough to be wrapped and carried to the edge of the burial place.

The household was a stem family. Skeron’s mother, Monun, still ruled the hearth when Pleuron was little. She kept the tally of stored grain and smoked meat, decided when the family made offerings, and corrected children with a sharp hand and sharper voice. Pleuron followed her to the hilltop grove with the other children. He watched her set a shallow bowl on the ground, pour beer, and press a piece of fat and a pinch of salt into the earth for the ancestors of their line. He learned the words to say at the start and end, not because he believed in abstract things, but because Monun demanded the correct sequence.

His closest companion in those years was his older sister Varis. She was two years older and the first child in the household to stay alive, and she acted as if she owned the yard. She pulled him along to gather kindling, showed him how to tell a pig track from a deer’s, and slapped his wrist when he grabbed at a pot before the elders had eaten. Varis could be gentle when they were alone. She also took her share of the work without asking permission, and Pleuron learned to do the same.

More death came. His younger sister Sarnus died at one. Another, Tauton, never reached naming and only existed in family talk as a count in a string of losses. The adults responded with tightened routines. Arban checked cradles and milk, Skeron checked roof lashings and smoke vents. Pleuron grew into a boy who finished tasks and double-checked the gate bar before he slept.

At fourteen he was trusted to take pigs out toward the oak stands and return them by dusk. He liked that work. He liked the smell of leaf mold and the quiet of the woods, and he liked carrying a small bag of roasted grains and onions, eating them slowly while he listened for the pigs. He also liked the evenings when men gathered to drink and talk. He learned which jokes pleased which cousin, which old man wanted deference, which insults caused fists.

When Pleuron was seventeen, his younger sister Delmon died at fourteen after a winter sickness that left her thin and coughing. The household held a memorial meal and placed food on a small dish at the edge of the burial ground. After that, Pleuron took winter preparations personally. He counted bundles of hay twice and argued if someone tried to sell too much grain to a trader for ornaments.

By twenty he carried a spear and a hide-covered shield and joined a seasonal levy gathered by local leaders for patrols and raids. Men met at a clearing, checked iron points and leather bindings, and marched along a river corridor where cattle trails crossed between communities. Pleuron stood watch at night and laughed quietly with his cousin Plator over smoked meat stolen from someone else’s pack. On the return, they drove captured livestock ahead of them and guarded a few captives with bound hands. Pleuron did what he was told and did it without complaint.

Two years later the feud cycle struck close. Scouts came with word of a retaliatory raid, and the district organized a refuge on higher ground. Families carried sacks of grain and small children up the slope, and men slept in short shifts with spears in hand. Outlying hayricks burned, and cattle were driven off before dawn. Pleuron helped track the raiders’ path, then helped rebuild the next day, cutting poles and hauling thatch.

He carried the tension back into ordinary life. At twenty-four he attended a communal sacrifice at the hilltop grove. The elders slaughtered an animal, and the meat was shared with beer in clay cups. A dispute over grazing boundaries flared between lineages. Pleuron took a shove, answered with words, and then a man struck him with a staff. Others joined. He was kicked as he fell. He returned home with cracked ribs and a bruised hip and lay on a bedding of straw while Arban fed him broth and Varis changed the compresses. He remembered names and faces.

That same year Monun died. She had still been correcting children's form during offerings the week before she fell into fever. The family buried her near the grove with the proper sequences she had taught.

At twenty-seven, anger and pride pushed him into violence of his own. In summer, carts queued at a stream crossing to fill jars and water animals. A rival herdsman insulted an elder from Pleuron’s lineage and claimed a hay meadow near the water. Pleuron stepped forward fast, called two men over with a tilt of his head, and they cornered the herdsman and beat him with fists and sticks. The elder’s relatives watched without stopping it. Afterward Pleuron washed blood off his knuckles in the same stream and returned to loading water as if nothing had happened.

A lean winter followed when Pleuron was twenty-nine. Stores ran low before the spring green. With Plator he crossed into a boundary pasture used by a rival hamlet and drove off a handful of goats. They told anyone who asked that the animals had wandered. They slaughtered them quickly, hid the skins, and shared meat with close relatives. Pleuron ate more than his share and justified it as payment for the labor he gave his father.

He never married. A brief relationship with a young woman named Scenon began when he was thirty. He visited her hamlet under the excuse of exchanging a hide for grain, and he stayed late enough that people noticed. Scenon's family demanded a clear arrangement and bridewealth. Skeron argued about the cost, and Pleuron did not press the matter. The visits stopped after one cold season, and the talk faded.

At thirty-three, during late autumn pig-mast, he drove pigs into the oak woods and tied off two young animals at the edge of an enclosure while he checked the rest. When he returned, the tethers had been cut and the pigs were gone. He tracked footprints to the edge of a neighboring territory and then stopped, because crossing further meant a fight he could not win alone. Elders heard the dispute. Verzo, an older mediator, listened and demanded compensation. The other side denied it and offered nothing. Pleuron carried the loss as a private score and tightened his watch thereafter, sleeping light during mast season.

In midlife he dealt with a changing toolkit. Iron became easier to find through people like Bricus, the smith and trader who moved between settlements with news and metal. Pleuron bought iron nails and an axe head with a bundle of hides and grain, and he inspected the edge every time he used it. He disliked waste. He corrected younger men when they left tools in wet grass.

At forty-one he climbed a slope to fell a beech for roof repair. The cut went wrong. The trunk shifted and pinned his lower leg. Men levered it off with poles, and he was carried home on a rough stretcher. The injury healed slowly. He walked with stiffness afterward, and he stopped taking the heaviest loads. He planned more, directed more, and grew impatient with anyone who ignored his instructions.

His mother Arban died when Pleuron was forty-two, worn down after years of grinding and carrying and watching children die. His father Skeron followed nine years later, at fifty-one. Pleuron helped wash the body and carry it to the burial place, then returned to the yard-house where the old man had corrected him as a boy.

Deaths thinned his generation. His younger brother Kentor died at fifty-two, leaving children who looked to their mother and uncles. His youngest sister Lator, married into another hamlet, died at fifty. Pleuron began spending more nights in a small dwelling space by the edge of the family yard rather than crowded under the main roof. He liked the quiet, and he liked arranging his tools where no one moved them.

When he was fifty-eight, Varis began failing after repeated winter illnesses. Her joints swelled and her strength dropped. Pleuron took primary responsibility. He fetched water and fuelwood, kept her bedding dry, and arranged help when he had to be away for herding. He brought her soft foods—porridge with fat, broth, curds—and sat with her at midday, talking about small things: whether the pigs had found good mast, whether Bricus had come through with new iron, whether the neighbors had repaired their fence. Varis scolded him even then, annoyed by his stubborn insistence on doing chores in a certain order. He listened and did it anyway.

Varis died when Pleuron was fifty-eight plus two years, after a long decline, and he oversaw the washing and wrapping. He did not have a wife or children to pull him back into another center. He kept ties with nieces and nephews, joined work-bees, and took part in grove feasts. He liked roasted pork skin when it was crisp, and he liked late afternoon when the heat broke and the animals settled. He also kept accounts of slights. He remembered who had refused compensation for the pigs decades earlier.

Old age came as narrowing strength. He remained in his solitary dwelling, close enough to hear voices from the main yard, far enough to keep control over his space. In his seventy-sixth year, after a season of cold mornings and short days, he stopped rising before dawn. He died at home during a period of frailty and exhaustion.

His family prepared his body, bound it in cloth and hide, and carried him to the burial place near the grove. They poured beer onto the ground, left a piece of meat and a simple iron knife beside him, and covered him with earth.
