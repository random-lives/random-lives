#     narrative_role: 'Farmer with seasonal sideline labor (hauling, construction, wood/charcoal).
#       Likely present for the birth but constrained by work demands and norms around
#       men’s roles in childbirth. Relationship quality: practical, duty-focused; grief
#       expressed through ritual responsibility (arranging simple burial, offerings),
#       not prolonged display.'

#     name: Li Shi

#       Primary caregiver at birth; would have borne the immediate physical risk and
#       the emotional weight of repeated neonatal losses. Relationship quality: intensely
#       intimate but brief; she is the person whose body and care most directly shaped

#     narrative_role: Eldest sister. A steady household helper who had already taken
#       on adult responsibilities (spinning, childcare, field help). Likely helped the
#       mother through late pregnancy and the birth; may have held the newborn briefly.
#       Her death the same year adds a sense of a household under pressure (illness,
#       hard season, or postpartum complications in the wider family).

#     narrative_role: Second child, a boy who died as a newborn. In family memory he

#     narrative_role: Third child and oldest surviving son at the time. As a teenager
#       in 1041, he would have been doing heavy farm work and errands and could have
#       been sent to fetch a midwife, hot water, or offerings when the baby sickened.
#       The household’s hopes for continuity and labor centered on him.

Northern Song officials governed the villages west of Luoyang, collecting grain tax and labor service through household registers. Zhang Shi’s family spoke the Central Plains tongue and kept a wooden tablet shelf in the main room for ancestors of the Zhang line, with daily incense and bowls of millet gruel on festival mornings. They also burned paper at the Earth God shrine by the fields and left scraps for the Kitchen God at year’s end.

Zhang Shi farmed his own plots and took sideline jobs when cash ran short—hauling loads on a cart, cutting wood on the low hills, helping on building crews. His wife Li Shi spun and wove at home, then joined fieldwork when wheat needed weeding. Their eldest, Da-niang, born in 1017, cooked, carried water, and minded younger kin; San-lang, born in 1026, shouldered farm tasks and ran errands. Two boys had come and gone in infancy, Er-lang in 1023 and Si-lang in 1033.

On September 22, 1041, Li Shi labored in the family room while Da-niang kept the brazier hot and San-lang went to fetch Wu Po, the midwife. The baby boy arrived small and quiet. Wu Po tied and cut the cord, washed him, and rubbed him with warm cloths. Before nightfall his body stiffened and his jaw clenched; he died that day.

Zhang Shi bought a strip of plain cloth and a small clay jar of wine. They wrapped the infant and buried him in a shallow grave on the family land’s edge, set a little millet and a few copper coins beside him, and lit incense at the ancestor tablets.
