He was born on February 17, 1108, in a village on the flat fields south of the Yellow River, in what is now Luohe in Henan. The area answered to the Northern Song state, with magistrates and clerks in the county seat keeping household registers and collecting grain and cloth tax. His people spoke the local Sinitic speech of the Central Plains and marked their lives with ancestor rites, village festivals, and Daoist ritual work when trouble came.

His name was 高顺民, Gao Shunmin. He entered a three-generation household. His grandfather Gao Shichang ran the courtyard and dealt with the tax runner. Shunmin’s father, Gao Desheng, worked their strips of dry-field land and took tenancy on a neighbor’s plot when work was heavy. Shunmin’s mother, Lady Sun, kept the stove and the loom. She spun thread on winter nights and carried food to the fields when men were hoeing. In the corner of the main room she set bowls of food and cups of water on the days the family honored the dead.

Shunmin grew up with three siblings. The eldest was a sister, Gao A-niang, who learned to twist hemp and to keep a baby quiet while adults worked. The third child was a brother who died at two, before he could speak clearly. The youngest was born and died on the same day. In the courtyard, the adults spoke of those deaths without long talk, in the same tone they used for a cracked pot or a broken handle.

As a boy Shunmin watched his grandfather burn paper and invite a Daoist ritual man into the house when sickness or bad dreams came. He remembered the smell of incense and the rasp of the priest’s chanting. He learned the names of local gods and the rules for keeping the family tablets clean. When his mother worried that an illness had come from offended spirits, she sent him with eggs and a few copper coins to the priest’s lodging by the temple.

He did not go far in schooling. A traveling teacher came for a season, and Shunmin sat with other boys while the teacher pointed at characters on a board. Shunmin learned to recognize a handful: numbers, common family names, the character for “rice,” and a few words seen on market signs. He could copy them slowly with a brush when he had to. When talk turned to longer texts, he stopped following and stared at the floor.

He stayed close to his village all his life. He walked to the market days and to the county seat a few times with his father to deliver grain and to stand in the tax office yard. He saw the clerks weighing and measuring, and he saw how a man with a loud voice could make trouble for people who did not answer fast enough. He learned to keep quiet when officials were near.

In his late teens the world changed. News came down the roads about the Jurchen and their victories in the north. After 1126 the roads carried soldiers and men pressed for labor. Grain prices shifted. Some families hid a portion of their stores and lied about their yields. Others sold animals to pay what was demanded. Shunmin watched his father count out cloth and grain while muttering at the tax runner. When Kaifeng fell, refugees passed through the area, thin and wary, asking for food or work. A few stayed in nearby hamlets. Most moved on.

Shunmin married in his twenties. His first wife was Lady Zhang, from a village within walking distance. She moved into the Gao courtyard and learned his mother’s ways at the stove and loom. Shunmin farmed with his father and grandfather, but he also took up craft work. He learned carpentry from an older man who needed extra hands: straightening beams, cutting mortises, fixing doors, shaping plow handles. He liked work that ended in a solid object he could touch. He worried over mistakes and rechecked measurements, then worried again.

Children came. The first was a son, Gao Liang, who lived. Shunmin’s second child was a daughter who died at birth. A third child, a daughter named Gao Mei, lived nine years and then died after a bout of illness that left her thin and quiet. Two more children were born dead. Each burial cost grain, paper, and payment to ritual men. Each death left the household tense and quick to anger.

Shunmin’s first wife died while he was still a young man, before his beard was fully gray. The family brought in a Daoist priest for rites, and Shunmin stood through them without speaking. He remarried. His second wife, Lady Liu, came from a poorer household and arrived with a smaller dowry. She took charge of the cooking and spinning and treated Gao Liang as her own, with a strict hand and a steady routine. In the evenings she asked Shunmin what he owed and what he had taken in. He answered in short phrases, then paced the yard.

In his mid-thirties, after several poor harvests, the household fell behind. The tax quota did not shrink because the yield had been low. Rent on the extra plot came due. Then came the expense of burying Gao Mei. Shunmin carried a bundle of carpentry tools to a lender in the market town and left them on the counter. He accepted a grain loan at harsh terms, with witnesses watching and a note he could not read. When he went home, Lady Liu counted the grain and asked what they would plant with. Shunmin went to the shed and stared at the seed jar, then walked out to the field and measured the rows with his eyes.

He worked harder after that. He took small jobs from neighbors: repairing a roof edge, replacing a broken beam, mending a cart. He accepted payment in grain when cash was scarce. He kept a few tallies on a wooden slip, marking numbers he recognized. When he could not remember, he asked his son to repeat the count. Gao Liang learned quickly. Shunmin did not.

As his son reached adulthood, Gao Liang married and brought home Lady He. The household became a stem household with Shunmin at its head. Lady Liu and Lady He shared the cooking and spinning. Shunmin gave orders about tools and lumber and the timing of fieldwork. When a task went wrong, he snapped at the nearest person, then apologized by silence, fixing the mistake himself.

In his early forties the village and nearby hamlets hired him for a larger job. A ditch that carried water across the fields had collapsed in places, and a small bridge of timbers had begun to sag. The headmen pooled grain and coins. Shunmin set the plan. He chose which trees to cut, checked the joinery, and organized labor so men did not work at cross purposes. He argued with one headman over the length of the timbers and refused to shorten them. He won. When the ditch ran clean again and the bridge held, the community held a completion feast. Shunmin sat where he was told and received a publicly acknowledged portion of meat and wine. He ate without talking much. On the walk home he checked the bridge one more time.

In his late forties he began to cough. At first it came after exertion, then in the mornings, then at night. He kept working, but he stopped taking long jobs far from the village. Lady Liu burned incense and called a Daoist priest, who wrote talismans and instructed them to hang them in the room and to avoid certain foods. Shunmin followed the instructions precisely for a time, then forgot, then tried again. The cough persisted. His clothing loosened. He sat on a low stool and watched his son plane boards.

By 1159 he could not walk to the fields without resting. Gao Liang managed the farm work and the craft jobs. Shunmin stayed near the house, giving short instructions, then falling quiet. On September 29, 1159, after months of coughing and weight loss, he died in the family courtyard room with Lady Liu and Gao Liang present. The household sent for Daoist rites and prepared the body for burial.
