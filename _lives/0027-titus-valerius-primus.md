Titus Valerius Primus was born in midwinter, with the sea wind coming in over low fields and tidal water. His people lived on the wet edge of the Redones and Coriosolites country, where farmsteads sat behind hedges and ditches and the pasture stayed soft underfoot.

His father worked a mixed holding. He pushed grain when the weather gave him a chance and kept pigs and a few cattle so one bad season would not end the house. His mother handled milk and small stock and took what she could to market: curds, butter, and sour cheese wrapped for the road.

Titus was the second child. The house filled fast after him. One of the babies died within days and was carried out before Titus understood what was happening. The others grew into the yard and the doorway until there was never a quiet corner. Titus learned to keep his hands on what was his and to speak only when he needed an answer.

His mother used Gaulish when she was angry or tired. She used Latin when measures and payment were involved. Titus grew up with both. He never learned letters in either. When his father needed a count kept, he cut marks into a stick. When a notice or contract came from town, they brought it to someone who could read it aloud.

As a boy Titus worked without being chased. He did not joke with the other boys. He did not try to lead them. He did the task the same way each time and reacted badly when someone corrected him in front of others. He would go quiet and rigid, then answer later with small meanness: a gate left unlatched, a tool set down where it would be stepped on. He did not brood over storms or sickness. If wind flattened the rye, he went out and dragged it up with a rake. If a calf failed, he watched it fail and then carried it out.

In his early teens a wet year spoiled the grain. The ground never hardened. Heads mildewed before they filled. The bins sank low, and his mother thinned the milk and still sold it because rent and tax were taken whether the harvest came in or not. A collector arrived with an escort and stood in the yard while his father measured out what was owed. Titus watched his father’s face tighten and learned what the town meant to a farm: a place that took and did not wait.

When Titus was grown there was no land for another household. He left without a fight and walked inland to the nearest civitas town, a place of stone buildings, workshops, and a market that never fully stopped. He arrived with a cloak, a knife, and the habit of doing what he was told as long as the terms were clear.

At first he slept under cover behind other people’s sheds and paid for a corner when he had coin. He hated crowds. He learned side lanes and back courts and crossed the market when it thinned.

He took general labor. He carried stone, hauled rubble, shifted sacks and timber, turned a windlass when a load needed lifting. He could not read marks on crates and he did not pretend he could. He judged weight by feel and kept a strap from slipping. Foremen used him because he did not wander off and because he did not get distracted by talk. They also learned he did not bend.

In his twenties a contractor tried to cut his pay, saying the workday had been shortened. Titus did not bargain. He stood in front of the table and blocked the man from closing up. He spoke in Latin, hard and plain, and then in Gaulish when the contractor pretended not to understand. The contractor called for the town attendants who kept order near the forum. One of them grabbed Titus’s arm and told him to move. Titus stayed planted.

They shoved him out into the open space by the basilica and brought him before an official’s bench. The question was not who was right about the money. The question was why he was making a public disturbance. Titus paid a fine. He got his withheld coin after, because the contractor wanted him gone and did not want the same scene again. Titus did not apologize. He learned which men paid cleanly and which ones tried tricks.

He married in town because he wanted a household that answered to him. His wife came from people who brought dairy and small stock in from the countryside. She could stand at a stall and refuse an offer until it was fair, and she did not lower her eyes when men tried to pressure her.

They lived in a single rented room. They had a brazier, a chest, and hooks for tools. It was cramped, but it was theirs. They had four children. Titus handled the babies like awkward loads and passed them back quickly. When the children were old enough to understand, he corrected them constantly: hands wiped, cups held level, voices kept down. He did not coax. He ordered. He did not soften it when they cried.

Under Marcus Aurelius the town felt heavier. Requisitions and transport duties came through the magistrates. Grain, hides, and iron moved toward the armies on the rivers to the east and north. For Titus it meant more hauling and more men in charge who spoke as if the state owned every back in the street. He took the work and kept his mouth shut until someone tried to cheat him.

He kept his religion close to what he could touch. Outside the town, at a spring under alder, he poured milk and left a small cake when he wanted a job to hold or a child’s fever to break. In town, when festivals and vows drew people out, he did what the officials demanded. He stood in the line, made the gesture at the altar and the emperor’s image, and kept his face blank. He disliked being watched. He disliked being told to show feeling even more.

When the epidemic reached the region, it came with travelers and carts. At first it looked like ordinary bad luck: a workshop closed for days, then a second; a neighbor’s child carried out wrapped in cloth; a man found dead on his mat. Then the market thinned and the streets went sharp with fear. Temple officials led processions, and the magistrates expected attendance. Titus went and stood at the edge where he could leave first. When it was over he scrubbed the soot and incense from his hands at a trough until they stung.

Work changed. Building slowed. Clearing and burning increased. People paid to have bedding and rags carried out because no one in the house would touch them. Titus hauled bundles that smelled of sweat and sickness and dumped them at the place set aside outside the walls. He took the coin without thanks and did not linger while desperate eyes followed his hands.

Late in the winter of 178, after days of cold rain, he came home with pain behind his eyes and a heat in his skin. He ate a little and lay down without undressing. By morning the fever had him shaking. His wife kept him in the room, fed the brazier, and warmed water when she could get it. Within two days a rash spread across his torso and darkened. His mouth dried and his lips cracked.

He asked once for water in Gaulish and then stopped asking for anything. He did not plead. He did not curse the gods. He lay stiff, jaw set, as if refusing to give ground.

On January 17, 179, before daylight, Titus Valerius Primus stopped breathing on the mat beside the brazier. His wife opened the door to call someone from the lane. Cold air rolled in, carrying smoke from a fire burning somewhere nearby.
