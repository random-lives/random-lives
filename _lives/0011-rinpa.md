Rinpa was born in 1820 BC in a river-fed farming settlement in what is now the low plains of northern Bangladesh. No court or city governed his household. Authority sat with elders in a cluster of related homes, and ritual decisions belonged to a curing specialist who handled trance and divination when sickness came. His family spoke a Tibeto-Burman tongue and lived with Rinpa’s mother’s kin, in a yard of packed earth with cooking fires, storage baskets, and poles for drying fish.

His mother, Sema, had already carried seven children. Her first son had died in infancy in 1835 BC. Three daughters—Dima, Lenso, and Pati—were grown by the time Rinpa arrived, and they worked close to Sema, pounding grain, hauling water, and carrying fodder. Two sons, Kharu and Woren, were young men who took turns in the fields, set traps in wet ground, and watched small animals near the house. A baby girl born in 1823 BC had died quickly, and that loss stayed close to Sema’s hands and voice.

Rinpa came after the rice had been cut and bundled. He was small and quiet. On the third night, Sema’s aunt Jena brought a bowl of rice beer and called the curing man, Naro. Naro shook a rattle, marked ash on the doorway posts, and spoke to the household spirits. Sema tried to feed Rinpa, kept him warm against her skin, and refused to leave the hearth.

Rinpa died on July 13, 1819 BC from neonatal infection.
