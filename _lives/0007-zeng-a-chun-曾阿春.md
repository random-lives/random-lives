Zeng A-chun was born on April 11, 1554, in the hills and fields near Chaling, where the Ming state ruled through county magistrates, tax clerks, and village headmen. Her family spoke the local Xiang–Gan speech and lived by the routines of ancestor rites, Kitchen God offerings, and seasonal festivals that marked time as clearly as planting and harvest.

Her natal home held several generations under one roof line. Her grandmother, called Grandmother Zeng by the children, kept the ancestral tablets and watched the hearth. A-chun’s mother, Zeng Shi, moved between the cooking place, the vegetable plot, and the workbench for spinning and sewing. Her father, Zeng Rong, carried loads to periodic markets and sometimes went farther along the roads with salt, oil, and cloth, returning with cash, rumors, and the smell of other kitchens on his clothes.

A-chun arrived as the fifth child. The household carried two earlier losses: a baby boy born in 1548 who died before his first winter, and another boy in 1552 who lasted only a short time. The dead infants were not spoken of in long speeches, but they shaped how the adults acted. When neighbors brought news of a child with a cough, Grandmother Zeng lit incense and placed a small bowl of rice before the tablets. Zeng Shi tied protective knots at the edge of A-chun’s jacket and scolded anyone who left the door unlatched at night.

As a small girl, A-chun learned the shape of the day by tasks. She woke to the scraping sound of a pot on the hearth stones and the smell of rice gruel. She carried water in a small bucket that bumped her knees, then sat near the spinning wheel and sorted cotton by feel. Her older sister, Zeng Yulan, born in 1546, teased her for counting everything—bowls, threads, handfuls of beans. A-chun snapped back quickly. The teasing ended when she turned her head and refused to answer. Later, when she had calmed, she followed Yulan to the riverbank and watched her wash cloth, the two of them squatting on stones and talking about which patches of current carried leaves away faster.

The surviving older brother, Zeng Liang, born in 1550, took more freedom than the girls. He ran errands to the market stalls and returned chewing roasted peanuts, showing off a string of coins. A-chun demanded to know what he paid. Liang laughed and told her it was none of her business. She chased him across the yard and grabbed at his sleeve. Their mother broke it up with a quick smack and set both of them to pounding grain.

In the 1560s the weather turned unreliable. One year the early rains failed and the seedlings struggled; another year a late downpour flattened grain just before harvest. Zeng Rong came back from market with the same sentence repeated: prices had risen again. A-chun listened while pretending not to. She began keeping scraps without being told. After meals she swept up spilled grains and tucked them into a small cloth bag, then hid the bag behind a jar. When her mother found it, A-chun insisted it was for seed. Zeng Shi took the bag and said nothing more, but she kept it instead of throwing it away.

At festivals, A-chun carried offerings as soon as she was tall enough: a dish of pork slices for the ancestors, a cup of wine for the kitchen altar before the year’s end. She liked the day when paper door gods were replaced, the fresh prints bright and sharp. She also liked market mornings, when her father let her walk beside him for part of the road. She watched the measuring scoops and listened to the shouting. She could not read the shop signs, but she remembered which man sold the better oil and which woman’s bean curd tasted sweeter.

Marriage negotiations came to the Zeng household when A-chun was sixteen. She pretended not to listen while older men spoke. At night she lay awake, hearing the insects and counting breaths, imagining a new kitchen, a new mother-in-law’s voice, the distance from her younger sister, A-mei, born in 1557. A-chun avoided speaking to A-mei for two days, then suddenly took her to the river and taught her how to tighten thread without breaking it.

In 1571, at seventeen, she married Luo Shun of a village within a day’s travel and moved into his family’s compound. His father was dead; his mother, a widowed Luo woman, held the keys and the right to assign work. The household remained a stem family with one elder at the center. A-chun’s first weeks were filled with rules stated once and expected to be remembered: where to store the sickles, which bowl was for guests, how much rice to rinse for each pot. She remembered everything. She also argued when she thought a rule wasted food. On the third month after the wedding, she corrected her mother-in-law’s counting of bean cakes and received a sharp rebuke in front of the hearth. A-chun clenched her jaw and returned to cutting vegetables, her hands moving fast and exact.

Luo Shun farmed and carried goods to market when he could, following the pull of a cash economy that reached into the villages through salt, cloth, and taxes commuted into silver or copper. When he traveled, A-chun set herself to the fields with the older women. She insisted the seed rice be dried longer before storage, even when others wanted to rest. She folded her own clothing the same way each time, corners aligned, and became angry when someone used her spindle without asking.

Her anxiety showed in small routines. She checked the latch twice before sleeping. She rose before dawn to listen for rain on the roof and to count the jars. If Luo Shun returned late from market, she sat upright until he arrived, then questioned him about the roads and whether he had seen soldiers or bandits. After he answered, she asked again, as if she had missed something.

At nineteen she gave birth to a daughter, Luo A-juan. The child was strong and loud. A-chun kept her close, swaddled tightly, and watched her breathing. She made extra offerings at the household altar—a cup of wine, incense, a dish of meat placed before the tablets—and sent Luo Shun to burn incense at the village temple on a day chosen by an older woman. When neighbors asked to hold the baby, A-chun handed her over reluctantly and stood close enough to see the baby's mouth and nose.

By her mid-twenties A-chun had settled into the rhythms of her husband's village, with its work days and festival days and the steady pressure of the Ming tax calendar. She had one friend she chose for herself, a neighbor woman named Qin Siniang, who married into the next lane. Siniang had a rough laugh and told stories about quarrels in the market. A-chun enjoyed listening while they shelled beans together. She almost never told stories of her own, but once, when Siniang joked about a rooster that attacked a tax clerk's leg, A-chun laughed hard enough to startle her daughter.

That same year a busy market-day brought strangers past their gate. She had laid out a length of homespun cloth to air, and beside it a small bundle of cotton thread she had saved for winter garments. While she was in the back plot cutting greens, someone slipped into the yard. The cloth and thread disappeared. A-chun searched the compound until her hands were black with dust and she had pulled every basket from its place. She marched to the lane and confronted two women returning from the market, accusing them straight to their faces. They shouted back. Luo Shun pulled her away. That night she did not sleep, and in the following weeks she tied her bundles high and kept the gate barred even in daylight. She demanded that her mother-in-law count stores with her, jar by jar.

A run of poor weather followed. Drought hit early and the price of grain rose at the market. Tax and levy tallies did not shrink with the harvest. The household argued over how much rice could be spared. A-chun calculated how many dou they needed to plant again and how many mouths the jars had to feed. When the local tallying came, she helped Luo Shun and his mother quietly underreport part of the grain yield, keeping extra rice hidden for food and seed. She stayed near the jars while the men talked, listening for exact words, then moved the hidden rice back after the visitor left.

The following year her health began to fail in a way that did not match the common fevers. She still worked, but she paused more often with a hand pressed hard to her side. She stopped eating certain foods because she believed they made her worse, then scolded herself for wasting strength. She continued to spin and to mend, her stitches tight. She argued with Luo Shun about buying medicine because she feared the cost, then demanded that he buy it because she feared dying.

She died at twenty-eight in her husband's household. The widowed mother-in-law directed the washing of the body and the preparations. Luo Shun arranged the necessary rites and reported the death as required. A-juan, not yet ten, stayed close to Qin Siniang until the household settled.
