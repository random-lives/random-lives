#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 27
#     connection: Placed in a lean season with drought/poor yields and tax demands;

#   reasoning: Small-scale norm-violations like underreporting produce/taxes, taking

Zeng A-chun was born on April 11, 1554, in a hamlet of fields and forested hills in the county of Chaling, under the Ming dynasty. The magistrate’s yamen, the tax registers, and the corvée lists reached even small villages, but daily authority sat closer: elders, lineage rules, and the household altar. Her family spoke the local Xiang–Gan speech and kept the usual rites—incense to the ancestors, paper on the door at New Year, offerings to the Kitchen God before he “reported” at year’s end.

She arrived as the fifth child in a house already crowded with memory. Her mother, Zeng Shi, had buried two infant sons: one born in 1548 and one in 1552. Their names were not spoken much, but their absence shaped the way adults handled babies. Water for bathing was boiled longer than it needed to be. A cradle was not left near a draft. When A-chun cried, her grandmother, Grandmother Zeng, muttered quick petitions and moved the child closer to the warm brick bed.

Her father, Zeng Rong, did not stay only in the fields. He carried loads to market—salt when he could get it, oil, sometimes cloth—walking the roads between villages and small towns. He returned with copper cash knotted on a cord, news of price changes, and stories about the county clerks who took fees for writing and sealing documents. When he left before dawn, A-chun woke and listened for the gate bar sliding back into place, then lay tense, counting the minutes until the rooster cried again. When he came home late, she asked questions without softness. Where had he slept. Who had he traveled with. What had he heard about taxes this season.

Her eldest sister, Zeng Yulan, born in 1546, became A-chun’s first teacher. Yulan showed her how to separate cotton, roll it into slivers, and keep the spindle steady. A-chun’s hands learned fast. She pulled the thread tight and even and snapped at her younger sister, Zeng A-mei, born in 1557, when A-mei’s spinning knotted. A-mei laughed and called her “Little Spring” as if it were a joke, and A-chun’s mouth tightened. She never liked jokes at her expense.

By 1561, A-chun carried water with a shoulder pole, fed the fire, and watched for pigs nosing into the garden. She was not taught to read. Men and boys sometimes gathered near the village to recite, and she listened to the rhythm from a distance while she shelled beans. She remembered numbers, measures, and prices better than most adults. When her father counted cash, she watched his fingers and corrected him when he skipped a knot. He scolded her once for speaking too sharply, then stopped correcting her back when she was right.

The mid-1560s brought a hard year of irregular rains. Seedlings failed in some paddies and stood thin in others. Grain prices rose in the market and neighbors began to bargain harder over small things—worn baskets, bundles of fuel, a scoop of oil. A-chun began to hide small stores. She rolled thread into tighter balls and tucked them deeper into a jar so rats would not chew them. She saved broken bits of dried radish and salted them again. When her mother tried to loosen her grip, A-chun argued until her voice shook. That shaking became part of her. It came in her hands when she was tired and in her chest when she heard coughing behind a wall at night.

By 1570, marriage talk no longer stayed in whispers. Her surviving elder brother, Zeng Liang, born in 1550, was married and thinking about his own children and his share of the household. He pushed to settle A-chun’s match. Her parents chose a family in a nearby village: the Luo. The man was Luo Shun, a farmer with enough land to keep a household fed when years were good. His father was dead. His mother lived as a widow in the main room and held the household keys.

In 1571, A-chun left her natal village and walked with the bridal party to Luo Shun’s home, one day’s travel away. The move tightened her stomach for weeks. She touched every tool in the yard, checked every jar of grain, measured the space between the cooking hearth and the door. Her mother-in-law, the widowed Luo woman, watched her and corrected her at the stove. A-chun answered back too quickly and then lay awake afterward, listing what she had said, rehearsing it again and again until dawn. In daylight she worked without pause. She mended clothes before anyone asked. She swept the packed-earth floor twice. She kept the thread basket covered and scolded a neighbor child for reaching into it.

A-chun grew close to one woman by choice: Shen Lian, a neighbor wife whose husband carted firewood to town. Shen Lian talked while her hands worked, and A-chun liked that she didn’t ask for explanations. In the late afternoons they spun together under the eaves where the light held. Shen Lian brought a small bowl of sweet fermented rice once, and A-chun ate it quickly and then pretended she had not wanted more. She preferred the quiet after a meal, when the kitchen was clean and the bowls were stacked, and she could sit and twist a length of thread into skeins with no one speaking.

In 1573, A-chun gave birth to a daughter, Luo A-juan. She stayed rigid with fear through the labor, then watched the baby’s breathing so closely that she jolted awake at every shift. She did not relax when A-juan grew through infancy. She kept the child’s shirt strings tied a certain way and grew angry when Shen Lian loosened them once, saying the child looked cramped. That anger pushed Shen Lian away for a season, until A-chun brought her a strip of dried fish at New Year as an apology without words.

Money moved more through the village each year. Luo Shun paid some dues in cash when the collectors allowed it; other times they demanded grain by measure. A-chun tracked what left the granary and what returned from the field. She listened when her husband spoke about silver, about prices in the market, about clerks who wanted extra for a stamp. She could not read the lists but understood the leverage of timing and concealment.

In 1578, on a busy market-day when the yard was full of noise—neighbors calling out, A-juan running underfoot, the mother-in-law arguing over how much oil to buy—someone slipped through the open gate. A-chun found it at dusk, when she reached for the cloth she had been saving for winter garments. A length of homespun was gone, and a bundle of cotton thread with it. She stood in the storage corner, breathing hard through her nose, then searched every jar as if the thief had hidden it inside her own house. That night she barred the gate before sunset and checked it twice. She accused a neighbor’s teenage son to his face. Luo Shun dragged her away before the quarrel became a brawl.

In 1581, a lean season followed uneven rains. The plants stood shorter and the heads filled poorly. Taxes did not shrink with the stalks. The village prepared its tallies for the levy, and Luo Shun talked about how many dou they could spare and still have seed for the next planting. A-chun kept the measure basket in her own hands. When the tallying came, she helped shift a portion of grain into a back jar and smoothed chaff over the top so it looked undisturbed. She did it with fast, precise movements, then washed the dust off her arms and spoke sharply to A-juan for stepping too close.

By 1582, A-chun carried pain that did not pass. It began as a tightness under her ribs and a swelling she felt when she lifted water. She tried to work through it, tightened her belt, and forced herself into the fields. Some days she vomited in the weeds and then went back to transplanting. She slept in short bursts and woke sweating, pressing a hand to her belly to check what had changed.

On February 1, 1583, Zeng A-chun died in Luo Shun’s household. The widowed mother-in-law handled the funeral arrangements and the offerings; Luo Shun carried the obligations to the lineage hall. A-juan was nine years old.
