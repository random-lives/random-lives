Zeng A-chun was born on April 11, 1554, in the hills and fields of the Hunan–Jiangxi border country, under the Ming empire’s county offices and tax registers. Her family spoke the local Xiang–Gan village speech, kept the Zeng ancestors on a home altar, and treated the Kitchen God as part of the household’s daily accounting of luck and fault.

She arrived as the fifth child in a house that had already held grief. An older brother born in 1548 had lived only long enough to be wrapped and carried out; another boy followed in 1552 and also died in infancy. The surviving children stayed close together in age: her eldest sister Zeng Yulan, born in 1546; a brother, Zeng Liang, born in 1550; then A-chun; then the youngest sister, Zeng A-mei, in 1557. Their father, Zeng Rong, did farm work when he had to, but he earned much of the household’s cash by carrying goods to periodic markets—salt, oil, bolts of cloth, small bundles of bamboo ware—moving along footpaths and roads with a shoulder pole. When he returned, he brought news along with a few copper cash coins and sometimes a pinch of tea or a strip of dried fish.

At home, A-chun grew up under the authority of her parents and a grandmother everyone addressed as Zeng-po. The old woman kept the incense and the small red paper talismans in a wooden box and watched what went in and out of the grain jar. On the first and fifteenth days, the family lit incense before the ancestral tablets. At the year’s end they pasted fresh door gods on the lintel; before New Year they offered sticky sweets and a little wine to the Kitchen God to keep his report favorable. A-chun learned the order of those acts before she learned any characters; she never became a reader or a writer.

By six she carried water in a small bucket and learned to keep the fire steady so the rice pot didn’t scorch. Her mother, Zeng Shi, worked constantly: weeding and transplanting when the fields demanded it, feeding pigs and chickens, and turning raw cotton into thread. When A-chun was eight, her mother put a small spindle in her hands and slapped it away when the twist went slack. A-chun watched with narrowed eyes, started again, and kept at it until the thread held tight. She grew into a girl who checked her work twice and snapped at anyone who told her it was “good enough.”

Her worries showed early. When a neighbor’s child coughed for days, A-chun slept lightly and woke at every sound, then went to touch her younger sister’s forehead with the back of her hand. She counted the family’s stored grain by eye and became angry when someone scooped from the jar carelessly, leaving the surface uneven. If her mother sent her to the riverbank to rinse cloth, she stayed until the water ran clear and her fingers were numb.

The Ming tax and service obligations were not abstractions in their village. Men were called for transport labor or small public works; grain had to be measured and delivered; disputes about land and water moved through clerks and runners. Zeng Rong’s market trips kept them tied to cash as well as grain. More and more payments were discussed in terms of silver and coin, even when the family mostly handled rice and thread. A-chun learned what a bolt of cloth could buy when salt prices rose. She listened to men talk near the doorway and remembered the numbers.

A dry year in her adolescence tightened everyone’s jaw. In 1568 the rains came late, and the rice plants stood thinner in the paddies that could be watered at all. At market, grain cost more; women argued over measure baskets. Zeng Shi stretched meals with sweet potatoes and greens. A-chun began saving small offcuts of cloth and winding leftover thread onto reed spools, hiding them in a covered basket under bedding. Her sister Yulan teased her for it, calling her “little ledger,” and A-chun answered with a sharp look and no laugh. Later, with only the two sisters in the yard, she let herself smile at the nickname and flicked water at Yulan’s sleeve.

Marriage negotiations started before A-chun had finished growing. In 1571, at seventeen, she was married into the Luo family of a nearby village, a day’s travel along roads and paths. Her husband, Luo Shun, was close to her age and worked the fields; his family held enough land to keep a steady hearth. One parent-in-law was already dead, leaving a widowed mother-in-law, whom the household addressed as Luo-mu. The house was still a stem household: one main cooking place, one grain store, one elder’s authority. A-chun brought bedding, a trunk with clothes she had sewn, and a bundle of thread and cloth from her own hands.

The first months in the Luo home tightened her chest. She woke before dawn, swept the yard, fed animals, and walked to the fields with the others. If Luo-mu corrected her, A-chun answered too quickly. Once, when told she had cut vegetable strips too thick, she pushed the knife down and said, “Then you cut them.” The air went hard; Luo Shun later told her to keep her mouth shut in front of his mother. That night A-chun lay awake, counting the beats between a dog’s bark and the next, and got up to check the door bar twice.

Her daughter was born in 1573. The baby girl, Luo A-juan, cried with strength, and A-chun held her with a grip that made her arms ache. After the birth, she kept a small dish of incense ash near the bed and renewed offerings carefully. At festivals she took A-juan to the ancestral rites and pressed the child’s hands together before the tablets. She watched the girl’s stools, the warmth of her skin, the way she breathed in sleep. When she heard of sickness in another hamlet, she boiled water longer and refused to let a neighbor kiss the child.

A-chun’s pleasures were narrow but real. She liked the quiet just before sunrise when the courtyard was still swept clean and the cooking pot hadn’t been set on the fire. She enjoyed fresh bean curd bought on market days, eaten quickly with a pinch of salt before anyone asked for a share. She also liked sitting near the doorway with another young wife, a woman named Qiu, twisting thread and trading small talk about prices and births. With Qiu she laughed once, suddenly, when a rooster chased a toddler across the yard and the child screamed like an old man. A-chun covered her mouth, then shook her head at herself, as if laughter wasted breath.

At twenty-four, in 1578, a market-day brought a different sort of lesson. The Luo courtyard was busy; people came and went to borrow measures and exchange news. A-chun had laid out a length of homespun cloth and a bundle of cotton thread she had saved for winter garments, planning to carry them to the dye pot. During the bustle a petty thief slipped into the yard, lifted the cloth and thread, and vanished into the flow of neighbors and hawkers. A-chun searched through baskets and behind the stove, then ran to the lane and stared at backs and baskets. She returned shaking, cheeks hot, and accused a neighbor’s boy of taking it. Luo-mu ordered her to stop making noise. That night A-chun wedged a stick under the door bar and slept in broken pieces, rising to check the yard whenever a dog barked.

The late 1570s brought more strain. One season the rains turned irregular and the paddies showed cracks at the edges. Grain prices rose, and the talk in the village turned to arrears and levies. Luo Shun went out more often to find side work, carrying loads for others when fields were thin. A-chun tightened the household’s use of grain, measuring carefully and scolding anyone who left rice stuck to the pot. She kept seed grain separate in a covered jar and watched it like a guard.

In 1581, when she was twenty-seven, the household faced the tax tally with a yield that would not cover both levy and eating. The local record-keeper came with his measures and his brush. A-chun stood near the grain, silent, then moved a basket aside as if it held chaff. When the tally was made, she helped Luo-mu and Luo Shun keep a few extra dou of rice out of the counted pile, hidden under husks and in a second container to be carried away after the clerk left. Her hands were steady. Afterward she washed them hard, as if scrubbing off the act.

The illness that ended her life did not resemble the fevers that tore through villages. It came as pain that stayed, a swelling and a wasting that did not lift with rest or herbal decoctions. She still rose to work, driven by habit, but she stopped in the yard with her hand pressed to her side and breathed through it. Her temper shortened further. She snapped at Luo Shun for bringing home poor salt; she scolded A-juan for dropping a bowl, then held the girl close a moment later and checked her for cuts.

On February 1, 1583, the Luo household washed Zeng A-chun’s body, dressed her in clean clothes she had sewn herself, and set her on a plank in the main room. Incense burned before the ancestors; paper was burned for traveling money. She was carried to the family burial ground and placed in the earth, with a small offering of rice and wine set at the grave.
