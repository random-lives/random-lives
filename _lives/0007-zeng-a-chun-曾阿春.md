#     trait: Neuroticism (89th percentile) + anxiety-spectrum disorder

#       clothing before it tears, and insists chores be finished even when others rest.
#     timing: Begins in adolescence (1564-1570) and becomes central in married household

#     trait: Conscientiousness (88th percentile)
#   - consequence: More frequent domestic friction; fewer supportive friendships among

#     of rice for food and seed.
#   reasoning: Small-scale norm-violations like underreporting produce/taxes, taking

Zeng A-chun was born on April 11, 1554, in the hills and small valleys of the Hunan–Jiangxi borderlands, under the Ming dynasty. Her family spoke the local Xiang–Gan village speech and lived by the mix of farming and market exchange that tied hamlets to county towns through itinerant carriers and periodic fairs.

She entered a busy house. Her mother, Zeng Shi, rose before dawn to rake embers back to flame, boil thin rice porridge, and send older children out with baskets. A-chun’s father, Zeng Rong, did not stay in the fields all year. He carried loads to market—salt, oil, cloth, whatever he could trade—then returned with coin, a little thread, sometimes a handful of dried fruit. When he left, the household tightened. Doors were checked twice. Grain jars were counted again after supper. A-chun learned that habit early, watching her mother’s hands hover over lids and knots.

Her eldest sister, Zeng Yulan, was eight years older and already competent by the time A-chun could walk steadily. Yulan took her to the yard edge to pick stray cotton from burrs and showed her how to roll fibers between finger and thumb. Two older brothers had died as infants before A-chun could remember them, but their absence had weight. On certain days the household burned incense longer than usual, and her grandmother, Grandmother Zeng, insisted on careful offerings—bowls set straight, chopsticks aligned. A-chun copied the attention and the tension.

By the time she was six, she carried water in a small bucket and fed scraps to a few chickens. She kept track of where things belonged. A broken bamboo scoop bothered her until it was repaired. When her younger sister, Zeng A-mei, was born in 1557, A-chun watched every cough and rash on the baby’s skin and reported it to her mother, sometimes twice a day.

The Ming tax calendar structured the year as clearly as planting. The household talked about grain measures, transport duties, and whether payment would be taken in kind or commuted. Zeng Rong brought home news from market: a new tally of levies, a rumor of a stricter clerk, the price of salt shifting because more people were paying with silver. A-chun could not read the placards in town, but she learned to listen for numbers and to remember them.

She became useful at the spindle by ten. Her mother set her to spinning in the evening when the day’s fieldwork ended, and Yulan corrected her without gentleness. A-chun took correction badly if it came with a smirk. She argued, then redid the work to prove the point. She liked the clean feel of finished thread on a spool, even thickness from end to end. When a neighbor woman came to borrow a needle and returned it bent, A-chun confronted her at the lane and demanded a replacement. The neighbor laughed; A-chun did not.

The 1560s brought uneven weather. One year the rains stalled and the soil cracked in the garden beds; another year the downpour arrived too hard and washed seed away. Food was never absent from the table, but it thinned. Her mother measured rice more carefully, bulking meals with greens. A-chun began keeping a private bundle of cotton ends and short lengths of thread tied in a cloth scrap, hidden behind a jar. It soothed her to know it was there.

In 1571, at seventeen, she married Luo Shun from a nearby village reached by a day’s walk and a river crossing. She left her natal house in the bridal sedan, jaw tight, hands folded, the sounds of her younger sister crying behind her. Luo Shun was a farmer with a steady way of speaking. His household was a widowed parent-in-law household: his father was dead, and his mother, Widow Luo, ran the inner rooms. A-chun entered under her gaze and learned quickly which bowls were used for guests and which for the family, where the grain was stored, and which corner of the yard was kept for drying bundles of millet and hemp.

The first year of marriage pressed her nerves flat. She checked the door bar at night and woke to listen for dogs. When Luo Shun came back late from the fields or from a neighbor’s house, she questioned him sharply. Widow Luo told her to hold her tongue; A-chun answered back and was sent to the stove room to work alone. She worked faster when angry. Dough was kneaded hard. Clothing was mended with stitches so small that Shun’s mother inspected them and said nothing.

She got along with one woman in the village, a potter’s wife named Qin, who lived near the path to the stream. Qin liked to talk while rinsing vegetables, and she told jokes about men boasting in the market. A-chun laughed once, suddenly, when Qin imitated a tax runner’s nasal voice. She continued to meet Qin by the stream because Qin did not pry into household disputes and because the streamside work had a rhythm that made A-chun’s thoughts settle.

In 1573 she gave birth to a daughter, Luo A-juan. The birth took place in the Luo house with older women present and boiled water ready. Afterward, A-chun tightened her routines further. She washed cloths carefully, kept smoke away from the baby’s face, and counted every spoon of rice porridge as A-juan began eating. At the Kitchen God offering near year’s end, she placed the sweets precisely and insisted that the bowl for the ancestors be filled to the right line. Widow Luo muttered that the gods were not accountants. A-chun answered that hunger was.

Market exchange grew more present in their lives as the 1570s progressed. Luo Shun carried surplus produce and cloth to the periodic market, and silver and strings of cash circulated more openly. A-chun did not handle much coin, but she knew the prices and corrected Shun when he claimed a trader had offered less than he should. She could do the calculations in her head, converting bundles of thread to lengths of cloth and then to salt or lamp oil.

In 1578, on a market-day when the lanes were crowded and visitors cut through courtyards to avoid the crush, someone entered their yard. A-chun had hung a length of homespun cloth under the eaves and kept a small bundle of cotton thread tied in a corner basket, saved for winter garments. By evening the cloth and the thread were gone. She did not cry; she searched every nook, then confronted neighbors one by one with direct questions that made them stiffen. Luo Shun told her to stop shaming people; she snapped that shame did not steal cloth. After that day she kept the gate latched even in daylight and moved textile goods into the inner room. She also began waking at the smallest sound, convinced that footsteps meant a thief.

A drought year hit hard in the early 1580s. The garden wilted and the rice set fewer grains. Prices rose at the market. Tax demands did not wait for rain. In 1581, when the local tallying of grain yields came, Luo Shun and Widow Luo argued in low voices about what they could spare and what seed they had to keep. A-chun sat with the measures in front of her and recited what remained jar by jar. When the levy tally came to their door, she helped present a reduced figure and kept a few extra dou of rice back, tucked under other sacks. She watched the clerk’s hands and face while he wrote, then exhaled only after the yard was empty.

Her health shifted in the last two years of her life. The trouble did not look like an epidemic fever. Pain came in waves that forced her to stop mid-task, gripping the edge of a table until it passed. Her abdomen swelled at times; then it softened again. She still insisted on rising early, still spun thread, still scolded A-juan for tracking mud inside, but she tired quickly and became sharper in speech.

On February 1, 1583, at twenty-eight, Zeng A-chun died in the Luo household. The winter air was cold and clear. Widow Luo and Luo Shun handled the funeral arrangements with the help of ritual specialists, and the household set out the offerings in the customary way. A-juan was nine years old.
