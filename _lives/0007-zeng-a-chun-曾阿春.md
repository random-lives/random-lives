#   reasoning: Small-scale norm-violations like underreporting produce/taxes, taking

Zeng A-chun was born on April 11, 1554, in the hill-and-valley countryside on the Hunan–Jiangxi borderlands, in territory governed by the Ming empire. Her family spoke the local Xiang–Gan speech of the villages and market towns. County clerks and runners came through to register households and press for grain tax, labor service, and fees that were increasingly paid in cash as silver and market exchange reached deeper into rural life.

She entered a crowded household. Her eldest sister, Zeng Yulan, was already eight and could carry a baby on her hip while doing other chores. An older brother had died the year A-chun was born, and another brother had been buried two years earlier, both before they had teeth. The story of those deaths stayed in the house. When the children coughed at night, someone always listened for the next breath. A-chun’s father, Zeng Rong, made a living from a little farming and from carrying goods to market—cloth, oil, salt when he could get it—walking with loads, sleeping in sheds, returning with small coins and gossip. Her mother, Zeng Shi, kept the hearth, the garden plot, and the spinning wheel moving, and she expected the same from her daughters.

A-chun learned early to do things in a fixed order. She rose when the yard was still dim and checked the fire ash for embers before she fetched water. She lined up the baskets by size and hated when someone left a sickle where it could be stepped on. When she was worried, she rubbed at the skin beside her thumbnail until it reddened. She learned the household rites without needing to be told twice: set out incense at the ancestor tablets on festival days, paste new door gods when the old paper peeled, and remember the Kitchen God before the New Year. Her grandmother, whom everyone called Grandmother Zeng, watched the offerings with sharp eyes and corrected the children if they bowed too fast.

She grew into field work as soon as her arms could carry a bucket without spilling it. In summer she weeded until her fingers cramped around the stems. In winter she sat near the doorway for light, twisting fiber and spinning thread. She could not read a single line, but she counted lengths and measures without confusion. She knew exactly how many handfuls of cotton made one skein if it was spun tightly. If the thread was uneven, she broke it and started again. Her mother scolded her for wasting time; A-chun answered back and did it anyway.

By the early 1560s the family talked more about prices. Salt cost more some months; cloth sold better in others. Rong came home complaining about the weight of his load and the number of hands that reached for payment along the road—ferry fees, gate fees, and the small demands of men who called themselves helpers. Grain tax still took grain, but more things in village life now required cash: repairs, hired labor, fees to avoid extra days of corvée hauling. When the rains failed one year and the seedlings took poorly, the household stretched porridge with greens and saved rice for planting. A-chun watched the jars every evening and pressed the lids down hard.

She argued with her elder brother, Zeng Liang, when he started thinking of his own marriage and his share of the household stores. Liang, four years older than A-chun, had a steady way of speaking that annoyed her. She corrected him on numbers, on how much cotton had been used, on how much oil had been sold. Yulan laughed once and called her “little accountant.” A-chun’s mouth tightened, but she remembered it and later used the same word when she counted out grain.

When A-chun was sixteen, marriage talk became plans. In 1571, at seventeen, she married Luo Shun from a village a day’s travel away and moved into his family’s home. Shun farmed and did occasional carrying work like her father. In the Luo household only one parent remained: Shun’s widowed mother, Luo Widow, who controlled the storage jars and the key to the chest. A-chun learned to speak carefully to her, then learned that careful words did not always prevent criticism. When Luo Widow found dust on a bowl, she blamed A-chun. When a chicken got into the garden, she blamed A-chun. A-chun answered sharply and then lay awake, turning her words over until dawn.

She made routines to keep herself steady. Before the day’s work she washed her hands twice, not once, and smoothed her hair with water. She checked the door bar when Shun went to the fields. She kept her best thread wrapped in cloth and tied with a knot that was hard to untie. When she worried, her stomach clenched and she felt heat in her face. She sometimes sat at the edge of the yard after the evening meal, listening to insects, rubbing her finger along the rim of a bowl until the sound stopped bothering her.

In 1573, at nineteen, she gave birth to a daughter, Luo A-juan. The baby cried loudly and fed well. A-chun refused to let neighbors hold the child for long. When A-juan’s cheeks flushed from heat, A-chun panicked and demanded boiled water and shade; Shun told her the child was only warm. She snapped that he did not watch closely. Luo Widow muttered that A-chun watched too closely, and A-chun stiffened at that too.

She found a friend anyway. A woman a few houses away, Hu Xiu, had married into the same village from another place and understood the loneliness of it. Hu Xiu teased A-chun about her habit of measuring cloth twice and laughed when A-chun finally admitted she did it three times. They sat together on winter afternoons, twisting fiber and talking about market prices and the small humiliations of in-law households. A-chun liked the salted mustard greens Hu Xiu made, chopped fine with chili, and sometimes traded a pinch of thread for a bowl.

By 1578, when A-chun was twenty-four, she had settled into the hardest years of work: the child still small, the fields demanding, and cloth needed for sale or barter. That autumn, on a busy market-day when neighbors came and went through the lanes, someone slipped into the Luo yard. A-chun discovered it when she went to the chest. A length of homespun cloth was gone, along with a small bundle of cotton thread she had saved for winter garments. She shouted for Shun and then for Luo Widow, then searched the yard, the cooking area, the chicken coop. The thief was already on the road, mixed into the noise of the market. Afterward she insisted the door bar be set even in daylight, and she accused a neighbor boy to his face until Shun pulled her away. That night she sat upright in bed listening for footsteps until her legs shook with fatigue.

The next years were tight. A season of irregular rains cut yields in the area. Grain prices rose at the market, and the talk in the village turned to seed and taxes. County demands did not lessen because the rains had failed. The Luo household still had to contribute labor days and provide payments that were now expected in cash more often than in kind. A-chun counted grain in dou and then counted again. Shun wanted to sell a little more rice to pay a fee; she refused and argued until her voice went hoarse. She pressed him to carry more goods to market for coin, then worried when he was gone.

In 1581, when she was twenty-seven, the household made a decision during the levy tally. A-chun helped measure out the grain and kept a portion back, shifting a few dou into a jar at the rear, under a cover of chaff. When the tallying men came, Shun spoke and Luo Widow nodded, and A-chun stood behind them and kept her face still. The jar stayed hidden until planting time. She felt sick with fear for days afterward and watched the lane for officials who never came.

By 1582 she had a persistent pain low in her belly that did not follow the seasons. Her appetite dropped. She kept working anyway, forcing herself into the fields and then to the spinning. When the pain sharpened, she snapped at A-juan for spilling water and then hugged the child too hard, apologizing with a tight voice. Sleep became broken. She woke with sweat on her neck and checked the jars, checked the door, checked the child.

On February 1, 1583, at twenty-eight, Zeng A-chun died in the Luo household in her husband’s village. The village women washed her and laid out the clothes she had sewn with her own hands. Shun notified her natal family by messenger along the road she had traveled as a bride. Her daughter A-juan remained in the care of Shun and Luo Widow.
