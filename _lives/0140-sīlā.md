#     name: Gopa
#     narrative_role: Fourth neonatal death around the time her first marriage is ending;
#       contributes to her social precarity and makes remarriage negotiations more fraught.
#     sex: M
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 6
#     connection: Begins after repeated sickness/food shortfalls; mother uses beatings
#       to force productivity and prevent 'waste' (spilled grain/water). Seeds later
#       PTSD-like hypervigilance.
#     incident: childhood_abuse
#   - age: 9
#     connection: Worsens during a bad rainy season when labor demands and hunger rise;
#       Sīlā learns to anticipate blows and to hide mistakes.
#     incident: childhood_abuse
#   - age: 24
#     connection: Triggered by lean season and grain-debt pressure in first marriage;
#       small thefts begin as 'gleaning' then become deliberate taking from threshing
#       floor margins.
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   - age: 25
#     connection: Poor monsoon + household sickness; debt to a better-off cultivator
#       ties directly to her later punishment and to intensified in-law conflict.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 26
#     connection: Caught taking grain; brought before elders/watchman; forced extra
#       labor repayment and small grain fine. Reinforces trauma symptoms (shame, intrusive
#       memories, avoidance).
#     incident: faced_punishment
#   - age: 27
#     connection: Continues briefly even after punishment due to ongoing hunger; becomes
#       more careful and fearful, heightening hypervigilance.
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   - age: 33
#     connection: During harvest labor in second marriage; injury reduces her ability
#       to meet labor obligations, increasing dependence and household tension.
#     incident: serious_accident
#   - age: 40
#     connection: Recurrent post-monsoon fevers and swelling become baseline; interacts
#       with poverty and prior injury to limit work and increase vulnerability in old
#       age.
#     incident: chronic_illness
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-5
#     key_events:
#     - Grows up in a laboring household with frequent food anxiety and seasonal sickness
#       after rains.
#     - Hears constant stories about dead siblings (Nandā, Bhadraka) and learns household
#       offerings at the hearth.
#     - Begins helping with water/fuel gathering unusually early due to scarcity.
#     phase: Early childhood in natal village (Colonelganj/Ghaghara plain hinterland)
#   - age_range: 6-15
#     key_events:
#     - Endures recurring harsh punishment and neglect during scarcity years; develops
#       hypervigilance and startle responses (PTSD-like).
#     - 'Shows striking intelligence: quick counting, memorizing field boundaries and
#       debts, noticing patterns of rainfall and grain storage.'
#     - Grandmother Soma dies (~age 14), removing a protective adult presence.
#     phase: Later childhood and adolescence
#   - age_range: 16-29
#     key_events:
#     - Married to Rudda (~age 18) and relocates to a nearby village; adapts to new
#       in-laws and labor demands.
#     - Series of poor monsoons and sickness drive debt and labor pledges; she engages
#       in repeated petty grain-taking to keep food in the pot.
#     - Multiple neonatal deaths; public punishment for grain-taking (~age 26); Rudda
#       dies and she becomes a widow (~age 29).
#     phase: 'Young adulthood: marriage, lean years, and first widowhood'
#   - age_range: 30-50
#     key_events:
#     - Remarries Sena (~age 30) to regain household security; lives in a larger affinal
#       network with step-kin.
#     - Serious harvest accident (~age 33) leaves lasting pain/limp and reduced earning
#       capacity.
#     - From ~age 40, recurrent fevers and swelling become chronic; she increasingly
#       relies on lighter tasks and kin negotiation.
#     phase: 'Middle adulthood: remarriage, injury, and rising chronic illness'
#   - age_range: 51-68
#     key_events:
#     - Younger siblings die (Gopāla ~age 40; Māyā ~age 41), thinning natal support.
#     - Second husband Sena dies (~age 61); Sīlā remains in his kin household as a dependent
#       elder, contributing with childcare, sorting grain, and ritual duties when able.
#     - Progressive weakness from malnutrition/anemia/parasites; death in 9 AD at 68.
#     phase: 'Old age: dependence in affinal household and decline'

#   - birth_year: -61
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: -61
#     name: Bhadraka
#     narrative_role: A newborn loss spoken of in low voices; his absence is used by
#       adults to justify strictness and fear around food, purity, and infant-care,
#       feeding Sīlā’s anxious sense that life can vanish overnight.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: -59
#     death_age: 68
#     death_year: 9

#     name: Māyā
#     narrative_role: Closest surviving sibling in childhood; alternates between ally

#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -54
#     death_age: 35
#     death_year: -19
#     name: Gopāla
#     narrative_role: Younger brother who grows into a restless wage-laborer; occasional
#       protector when home, but also a source of conflict when he returns hungry and
#       demanding. His death reduces Sīlā’s natal kin support in later life.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Sleep disruption and irritability; strained relationships with in-laws;
#       cautious, sometimes 'odd' reputation; difficulty concentrating during peak labor.
#     scene: Startles at footsteps behind her; compulsively checks grain pots and door-latches;
#       intrusive flashbacks of public shaming and childbirth blood/screams; avoids
#       threshing grounds after the punishment.
#     timing: Begins ages 6-10; intensifies ages 24-30; persists through old age
#     trait: Neuroticism (94th percentile) + PTSD-like stress reaction
#   - consequence: Triggers scolding and punishment; increases conflict with mother
#       and later in-laws; contributes to being blamed for misfortunes.
#     scene: Forgets agreed labor days and arrives late; leaves tasks half-done when
#       overwhelmed; loses small household items; struggles with long, repetitive processes
#       like careful grain sorting unless supervised.
#     timing: Most visible in adolescence and young adulthood; worsens during chronic
#       illness
#     trait: Conscientiousness low (14th percentile)
#   - consequence: Sometimes protects the household (better bargaining, planning), but
#       also increases rumination and fear; others may resent her sharpness.
#     scene: Quickly learns informal accounting of debts in measures of grain; can estimate
#       harvest yields by sight; anticipates which households will demand labor and
#       which routes avoid watchmen; remembers long genealogies and obligations in affinal
#       kin.
#     timing: Visible from ages 8-12 onward; crucial during debt crisis ages 24-28;
#       used for social navigation in old age
#     trait: Intelligence very high (96th percentile)
#   - consequence: Social support is thinner; rumors spread more easily; dependency
#       in old age feels more humiliating and tense.
#     scene: Keeps to the edge in festivals; speaks bluntly when anxious; has few close
#       friends beyond her sister Māyā; reluctant to ask for help until desperate.
#     timing: Adolescence onward
#     trait: Extraversion low (27th percentile) / Agreeableness low-moderate (29th percentile)
#   - consequence: Occasional benefit (new remedies/strategies), but can draw suspicion
#       from more conservative kin if she deviates from expected practice.
#     scene: Curious about mendicants’ stories and new rites; experiments with small
#       protective rituals and herbal treatments; asks detailed questions about distant
#       markets and travelers’ news.
#     timing: Young to middle adulthood (ages 18-45)
#     trait: Openness moderately high (70th percentile)
# number_of_children: '4'
# number_of_siblings: '4'
# occupation: Agricultural laborer (seasonal and peak-period fieldwork for own/others’
#   fields; weeding/harvest/carrying)
# religion: Household Brahmanical domestic rites + village deity/spirits (daily hearth/home

# - M
# structured_incidents:
# - event: During a hungry season she repeatedly took small amounts of unhusked grain
#     left in the field margins and from a neighbor’s threshing area, hiding it in her
#     bundle to feed her household.
#   reasoning: Petty theft (grain, fuelwood, gleaning beyond what was allowed) was a
#     common survival strategy among the poor, but opportunities for larger-scale fraud/burglary
#     were limited.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Recurring pattern, ages 24–27 (during successive lean seasons after marriage)
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime
# - event: After a poor monsoon and sickness in the household, her family fell into
#     grain-debt to a better-off cultivator; they had to pledge labor at low rates and
#     briefly sold a cow/goat to settle part of what was owed.
#   reasoning: Land-poor agricultural laborers were highly exposed to harvest failure,
#     debt, illness shocks, and widowhood; surviving to old age without adult children
#     makes a severe hardship episode likely.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Sustained period, ages 25–28
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: As a small child she was often beaten harshly for accidents and for not working
#     fast enough at fetching water/fuel, and at times was left unfed when supplies
#     ran short, while older siblings were prioritized for field help.
#   reasoning: In a stressed, land-poor household with multiple child deaths, harsh
#     physical discipline and neglect were common enough that at least one episode is
#     plausible, though not guaranteed.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Recurring pattern, ages 6–10
#   type: childhood_abuse
# - event: While carrying a heavy bundle of cut stalks during harvest, she slipped on
#     an embankment and badly injured her leg/hip; she was unable to work the fields
#     for weeks and walked with pain afterward.
#   reasoning: Agricultural labor involved falls, animal injuries, and tool accidents;
#     serious but survivable injuries were a meaningful lifetime risk.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Single event with long recovery, around age 33
#   type: serious_accident
# - event: From midlife onward she had recurring bouts of fever and weakness with persistent
#     pallor and swelling—likely a mix of parasite burden/anemia with repeated malaria-like
#     fevers—leaving her intermittently unable to do heavy labor.
#   reasoning: Long-term limitations from recurrent malaria, TB sequelae, chronic pain,
#     anemia/parasites, or gynecologic issues were common among older rural laborers.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Sustained condition with flare-ups, ages 40–68
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: She was confronted by a landholder’s watchman and taken before village elders
#     for taking grain; she was publicly shamed and made to repay with extra days of
#     labor, with a small fine in grain demanded from her household.
#   reasoning: No perpetrator categories were confirmed; for an ordinary rural woman,
#     formal arrest/trial was uncommon and most conflicts were handled informally unless
#     tied to serious theft/violence.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Single formal incident, around age 26
#   type: faced_punishment

Sīlā was born in a farming hamlet on the flat, wet land north of the great river system that fed the middle Ganga plain. Officials came through with demands for grain and labor in the name of whichever local ruler held the roads that year, and village elders handled most disputes. At home her family spoke a Middle Indo‑Aryan village speech, and they kept the household rites: a lamp at dusk, water poured for the ancestors, and small offerings at the cooking fire.

Her father, Dharaka, earned most of his food by working other people’s fields. He ploughed when someone lent him oxen, cut stalks with a sickle when harvest began, and carried loads when the headman assigned men to embankment work. Her mother, Kālī, did the same work when needed and ran the house besides. Sīlā grew up hearing two names spoken with care. Nandā, the older sister, had died at five, before Sīlā could remember her clearly. Bhadraka, a brother born the next year, lived only long enough to be washed and wrapped.

Sīlā learned early to watch faces and hands. When she was six, her mother started sending her alone to the water place with a pot that seemed too heavy. If she slipped and lost water, Kālī struck her with a thin switch cut from a bush by the path. If she came back slow, her arm yanked hard enough to leave marks. On days when grain ran low, Kālī fed the older children first because they could work longer in the fields. Sīlā learned to eat quickly and to hide small mistakes. She began waking at night to the sound of dogs and men’s voices outside and could not settle until she had checked the door‑latch by touch.

Her younger sister, Māyā, was born when Sīlā was three. Māyā’s hands were quick and she laughed easily. When they were older, the two girls shared tasks: one scooped dung for the fuel pile while the other gathered leaf plates, then they switched without being asked. They whispered together when their mother was angry, and when Dharaka brought home a handful of salt or a strip of jaggery, Māyā always tried to slip the first piece to Sīlā. Their younger brother Gopāla came two years after Māyā, loud and demanding. He kicked at everyone, then climbed onto Sīlā’s lap as if she owed him. She called him “little goat” and he bit her shoulder once for it.

Sīlā’s mind moved faster than the adults expected. By eight she could keep track of who owed her mother a basket of husked rice and who had borrowed a rope. She watched the clouds in the hot months and argued about whether they would get a good first rain. She listened when older men talked about measures and shares on the threshing floor. When she was told to fetch something, she remembered exactly where it had been put weeks earlier. Kālī used that sharpness against her when she was angry, saying Sīlā chose to be slow only to spite her.

Soma, Dharaka’s mother, lived close enough to visit but not in the same house. Soma kept a few goats and knew which bitter leaves eased a stomach after bad water. Sīlā went to Soma when she could, sitting by the doorway while Soma twisted fiber into rope. Soma died when Sīlā was fourteen, after a season of fever. The day Soma’s body was carried out, Sīlā stood too stiffly beside the women and startled at every touch.

At eighteen, Sīlā married Rudda, a laborer from a nearby village. Her hair was oiled and parted; vermilion was pressed into it at the parting, and bangles were slid onto her wrists. She left her parents' courtyard with a pot on her head and a small bundle of cloth. Dharaka died the next year, worn by labor and fever. In her husband's house Sīlā learned new rules: where to place the water jars, which corner was for the cow dung cakes, which ancestor names were spoken when the lamp was lit. She gave handfuls of rice and sesame into the hearth fire on the new moon and tied threads for protection at the village shrine where women left flowers and smears of red powder.

Her first son, Ajja, was born when she was twenty. He did not live. Two years later she carried another pregnancy to term and buried another son, Nanda, the same day he was washed. The women of the household made her sit while they pressed warm cloth to her belly and fed her thin gruel. The next morning she was back in the fields, pulling weeds with both hands. She stopped sleeping in long stretches. Any baby’s cry from a neighbor’s house made her chest tighten and her hands shake.

A poor monsoon came when she was twenty‑five. The harvest fell short and sickness spread after the rains; men shivered under quilts in the damp heat, and children’s bellies swelled. Rudda’s household borrowed grain from a better‑off cultivator and promised days of labor to repay. The next year the rains failed again. Sīlā watched the grain pot shrink and began taking what she could. After threshing she gathered the loose unhusked heads at the margins and slid extra into her bundle from a neighbor’s pile when no one looked. She did it again the next week, and again, careful to keep her eyes down and her hands steady.

At twenty‑six a watchman named Vikata caught her near the threshing ground. He grabbed her bundle, shook it, and grain spilled out. She was taken to Somadeva, one of the elders, and made to stand while men talked over her head. Somadeva set repayment: extra labor days for Rudda’s household and a small fine in grain. Women in the courtyard stared at her when she returned. She avoided the threshing floor after that and jumped whenever she heard Vikata’s sandals on hard ground.

The debt period lasted until she was twenty‑eight. A goat was sold, and Rudda worked himself raw. Sīlā’s third child, a daughter called Suma, died at birth when Sīlā was twenty‑five, and her fourth, a son called Gopa, was lost when she was twenty‑eight. After each birth she washed, sat before the hearth, and offered a pinch of rice with ghee, then went to the village shrine with the older women. She learned the proper words and said them fast, afraid of forgetting. When she did forget, she bit the inside of her cheek until it bled.

Rudda died when she was twenty‑nine, taken by a fever after the rains. Without a living child and without his protection, she became a burden in his house. The next year she remarried. Sena, a widower with family nearby, took her as his wife when she was thirty. He watched her closely at first, measuring whether she would work hard and keep quiet. She did not keep quiet. She argued when blamed and snapped when mocked. Sena answered with hard commands and occasional blows, then cooled and handed her a piece of roasted gram.

At thirty‑three, during harvest, Sīlā carried a heavy bundle of stalks along an embankment. Her foot slid in loose mud and she fell hard. Pain seized her hip and she could not stand. For weeks she stayed near the hearth, sorting lentils with shaking fingers and listening to other women talk. When she returned to the fields she limped, and in cold months the joint stiffened so badly she woke before dawn just to stretch it.

After forty the fevers started returning with the rains. She sweated, shivered, and woke with a mouth that tasted of metal. Her ankles swelled; her skin stayed pale. A healer named Jīvaka gave her decoctions of bitter bark and told the household to keep her to thin gruels and to avoid certain fish from stagnant water. When she felt well she worked too hard to make up for lost time, then collapsed again and lay listening for footsteps, sure someone was coming to accuse her.

Her mother Kālī had died some years earlier, after seasons of recurring fever. Māyā and Gopāla died within a year of each other when Sīlā was in her early forties. After that, messages from her natal village came less often. Sena lived into Sīlā's early sixties, then died in the rains of her sixty‑first year. She remained with her late husband's family, dependent on his brother's household. Punnā, the brother’s wife, controlled the grain bin and decided who ate first. Sīlā made herself useful: she watched toddlers, swept the courtyard, and sat at the edge of the cooking place picking stones from rice. On days she could stand, she carried water in small amounts and supervised the lamp at dusk. She still poured water for the ancestors and laid a few grains for the village spirits at the boundary stones.

In her last years she could not do heavy labor. The swelling in her legs worsened, and she ate little without wanting to. She died in the cool season at sixty‑eight, after days of weakness and diarrhea. Her husband's relatives washed her body, wrapped it in cloth, and carried it to the cremation place outside the settlement; a small offering of rice and sesame was placed with the fire, and water was poured afterward for her spirit and for the household ancestors.
