#   - age: 24
#     connection: Placed between births of Jori (-210) and Rina (-208) as a miscarriage/stillbirth
#       in -209; ties to heightened anxiety from earlier infant loss and increases dependence
#       on the household women who provide care.
#     incident: pregnancy_complications
#   - age: 27
#     connection: 'Placed in late autumn of -206 (age 27): goat stolen after descent

#       amplifying stress and household tension over stores and blame.'
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6
#     key_events:
#     - Learns household deity and ancestor offerings from grandmother Bhadra; is frequently
#       corrected for forgetting steps or wandering off (shows low conscientiousness
#       early).
#     - First vivid experience of death when grandfather Elder Kanna dies (around age
#       5); Vina becomes more fearful and watchful afterward (neuroticism seed).
#     phase: Early childhood in birth household
#   - age_range: 7-15
#     key_events:
#     - Begins daily dairying tasks (milking, churning, carrying water/fodder) alongside
#       her mother Suni; becomes socially active with other girls at springs/paths (extraversion).
#     - Periods of low mood, withdrawal, and irritability appear around early menses;
#       elders interpret it as 'weak spirit' or stubbornness (depression emerging).
#     - Household faces periodic levies/requests for produce or labor tied to Mauryan-linked
#       administration; brother Soma becomes more involved in negotiations, shaping
#       family expectations of obedience.
#     phase: Later childhood / adolescence
#   - age_range: 16-22
#     key_events:
#     - Marriage to Boma and move to nearby settlement (~<30 km) in -217; must adapt
#       to mother-in-law Tasi’s rules and a stem-family structure.
#     - Birth of first son Naro (-216); Vina’s status improves, but she becomes anxious
#       about infant illness and milk supply.
#     - 'Around -214: Vina’s father Dara dies; in the same year her infant Savo dies,
#       concentrating grief and triggering a more severe depressive episode.'
#     phase: Young wife and new mother (local patrilocal move)
#   - age_range: 23-27
#     key_events:
#     - Pregnancy complication event (late miscarriage/stillbirth with heavy bleeding
#       and fever) between -210 and -209; prolonged recovery changes household labor
#       allocation and increases Tasi’s criticism.
#     - Birth of Jori (-210) and later daughter Rina (-208); Vina becomes a key dairy
#       producer, managing milk conversion to ghee/curd for storage and exchange.
#     - Trade-route insecurity/news from the northwest frontier intermittently affects
#       market access and prices; household prioritizes storable dairy products.
#     phase: 'Established adulthood: dairying, losses, and household pressure'
#   - age_range: 28-31
#     key_events:
#     - Goat theft in late autumn when she is 26–27 already occurred earlier; continued
#       vigilance and suspicion colors later years, with disputes over watch duties
#       and tethering.
#     - Mother Suni dies around -206 (Vina ~27), removing an emotional anchor and increasing
#       depressive recurrence.
#     - Dies in -202 (age 31) during a febrile infectious illness; household duties
#       fall abruptly onto co-wives/kin and her older children.

#     timing: Adolescence onward; peaks after infant death (-214) and after miscarriage
#       (-209)
#     trait: Neuroticism (90th percentile)
#   - consequence: Feeds criticism from mother-in-law; after the goat theft, others
#       cite her 'carelessness' even if she wasn’t at fault.
#     scene: Forgets agreed tethering routines or misplaces a stored item (salt, ghee
#       pot seal), then improvises excuses or last-minute fixes.
#     timing: Childhood (grandmother scolding) and adulthood (household management conflicts)
#     trait: Low conscientiousness (10th percentile)
#   - consequence: Helps the household access help during her pregnancy complication
#       recovery; also sparks gossip in the in-law village.
#     scene: Talkative at springs and on paths; maintains a wide network of women for
#       swapping news, milk starters, and small favors.
#     timing: Late childhood through adult life
#     trait: High extraversion (76th percentile)
#   - consequence: Periodic household quarrels; husband Boma sometimes withdraws support
#       when conflict escalates.
#     scene: Pushes back when criticized, answers sharply, and is willing to argue about
#       labor division or accusations after the goat theft.
#     timing: Mostly adult married life
#     trait: Low agreeableness (21st percentile)
#   - consequence: Builds reputation for fairness; makes her a default person for handling
#       shared dairy tasks, increasing workload.
#     scene: Refuses to dilute milk or short neighbors on measure even when stores are
#       tight; insists on returning borrowed churn-stones and vessels promptly.
#     timing: Adulthood, especially during lean seasons
#     trait: High honesty-humility (88th percentile)
#   - consequence: Improves household dairy management and social navigation, partially
#       offsetting low conscientiousness.
#     scene: Quickly learns which fodders increase yield, remembers complex kin relations,
#       and anticipates who to ask for help or information on market days.
#     timing: Adolescence and adulthood
#     trait: High intelligence (92nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Reduced productivity and increased conflict; greater reliance on
#       other women for childcare and milking during episodes.
#     scene: Weeks-long periods of low appetite and slowed movement, neglect of grooming,
#       tearfulness, and thoughts that her family would be better without her, alternating
#       with brief functional stretches.
#     timing: First clear episode early teens; severe recurrence after infant death
#       (-214) and after miscarriage (-209); recurrence after mother’s death (-206)
#     trait: Depressive disorder (recurrent episodes)
#   - consequence: More teasing/criticism; may contribute to harder labors being assigned
#       to others while she is pushed into continuous dairy/childcare tasks.
#     scene: Struggles with heavy loads and high tether points; others underestimate
#       her, while she compensates by being verbally forceful and by using technique
#       rather than strength.
#     timing: Throughout, particularly visible after marriage when judged by in-laws
#     trait: Very short stature (2nd percentile)
# number_of_children: '4'
# number_of_siblings: '6'
# occupation: Dairying and livestock-based household production (milking, churning,

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During late autumn, after animals were brought down from higher grazing,
#     someone cut the tether and stole one of the household’s better milk goats from
#     the byre near their dwelling; the loss reduced milk and ghee production through
#     the cold season and forced the family to borrow or barter for dairy.
#   reasoning: Moderately prosperous agro-pastoral households owned portable wealth
#     (animals, dairy stores, textiles) that could be stolen, but low population density
#     and strong local kin enforcement reduces constant predation.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Age 26–27 (late autumn into early winter)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: In one pregnancy between her middle births, she suffered a late miscarriage
#     or stillbirth followed by heavy bleeding and fever; she survived after days of
#     weakness, with women of the household keeping her warm, giving broths and diluted
#     milk, and taking over milking and churning until she could stand again.
#   reasoning: Across multiple pregnancies in high-mortality contexts, miscarriage/stillbirth
#     and serious complications are common; her terminal death was febrile disease,
#     but she could still have had earlier obstetric complications.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 23–25 (during a pregnancy between live births)
#   type: pregnancy_complications

Vina was born in the upper valley country near the great lake and the river that ran west, where broadleaf forests came down close to the fields and the winter cold could hold for months. People spoke a Dardic Indo‑Aryan tongue at home and used a more widely understood market speech when dealing with traders and collectors passing through. The valley sat at the edge of Mauryan reach; officials did not live in every hamlet, but demands for grain, animals, or labor arrived with men carrying seals and tallies.

Her father, Dara, ran an agro‑pastoral household with enough animals and stored grain to keep kin together under one roof. Her mother, Suni, managed milk and butter more surely than anyone else in the compound. Vina was the last of seven births. The first child, Ramu, died in the year he was born. Jaya came next and lived. Soma, born a few years later, grew into the household’s steady hand. Two girls—Miri and Nali—died in infancy. Karu, the last boy before Vina, also died before he could walk. The women washed and wrapped those infants quickly, and the names stayed in the mouths of older women longer than in the mouths of men.

As a small child Vina stayed close to the hearth because she could not keep up with older children on the steep paths. Her height never caught up, and her grandmother Bhadra used it as proof that Vina needed watching. Bhadra kept the house rituals tight. At dawn she had Vina smear a little ghee on a stone set by the threshold, lay pinches of grain on a leaf, and whisper the names of dead kin to keep them friendly. When Vina forgot the order—grain first, then ghee—Bhadra rapped her knuckles and made her start over.

Elder Kanna, her grandfather, sat by the door when the weather allowed, mending straps and telling short stories about trails, animals, and the way snow shifted on ridgelines. Vina liked those stories and repeated them later, changing details for effect. At five she watched his funeral. Men carried him out wrapped in cloth; women placed a small pot of milk near him and a sprig of green. After he was gone she began waking at night to check whether her mother was still breathing, then lay awake listening to the wind.

By eight she followed Suni to the byre each morning. Her hands learned the rhythm of milking early, and she had a quick eye for which goat would kick, which cow needed calming. She talked while she worked, to the animals and to anyone nearby. If there was laughter at the spring path, it usually started with her. She grew into a girl who sought company even when her mouth got her into trouble.

The trouble came from forgetting and from her temper. She left a wooden bowl where a goat could step on it. She went to fetch water and came back without the rope. When Bhadra scolded her, Vina answered back, sharp and fast. Once, when she was twelve, her grandmother accused her of making the offerings carelessly. Vina flung the pinch of grain onto the ground and said it was all the same to dead people. Bhadra slapped her hard enough to leave a mark. That night Vina cried in the corner behind the grain bins and would not eat.

Men connected to the wider world passed through. A collector named Vedu came once with two assistants and demanded measures of stored grain. Soma handled the talk, using clipped, careful words and bringing out a goat for inspection so the men would not poke through everything. Vina listened from behind a wall and later repeated Vedu’s phrasing in a mocking voice that made Jaya laugh. Soma did not laugh. He told her to keep quiet when outsiders were near.

When Vina began bleeding each month, her mood changed in long stretches. Some weeks she talked and joked and worked quickly, then she would go dull and slow. She sat outside the byre staring at the ground. If someone asked her a simple question, she snapped. Suni tried to soothe her with warm milk and bread dipped in ghee. Bhadra said she needed stricter ritual attention. Vina did the offerings with trembling hands and then scrubbed them again, checking and rechecking the smear of ghee on the threshold stone.

Soma arranged her marriage when she was sixteen. The match was local, a household in a nearby settlement on the same valley floor. Her husband, Boma, was not a man of speeches. He watched a person’s hands and their pace at work. On her first day there her mother‑in‑law Tasi told her where the churn stone sat and how much milk was set aside for the household spirits. Vina answered quickly, too quickly, and Tasi’s eyes narrowed.

Within a year Vina had her first child, Naro, a son. The birth took place in the women’s room with the older women guiding her. Afterward Vina would not let anyone carry the baby far from her, and she checked his skin for warmth every time the wind shifted. When he lived past his first winter she began walking more freely, smiling when he toddled after the goats. She took pride in teaching him small tasks: holding a tether, fetching water without spilling, bringing in dung cakes for the fire.

Her father died when she was nineteen. News came to her married home in the mouth of a neighbor, and she left at once to return for mourning. Soma met her on the path and told her where to sit and what to do. In the same year Vina’s second son, Savo, was born and died before he could be carried outside. The women washed him and laid him on a cloth near the doorway while Boma stood with his jaw tight. After the burial Vina stopped speaking much. She moved slowly, forgot to skim the milk at the right time, and once let it sour in the pot. Tasi called her lazy and shameful. Vina answered with a curse and had to be pulled away.

She recovered enough to return to work, but the heaviness came back in waves. At twenty‑four she became pregnant again and carried the child late. One night pain started and did not end. She delivered a still child, and afterward she bled heavily and shook with fever. Haro, her sister‑in‑law, took over the byre before dawn and kept the animals calm. Ena, the older midwife‑healer, made thin broths and diluted milk and kept warm stones at Vina’s feet. Vina lay for days in the women’s room, sometimes muttering prayers to the household dead, sometimes refusing the cup pushed to her lips. When she could finally stand, she walked to the threshold stone and placed a careful offering of ghee without being prompted.

At twenty‑three she had already borne Jori, her third child, and two years after the miscarriage she bore Rina, a daughter. Jori grew into a stubborn boy who argued like his mother. Vina liked his quick answers and hid her smile when Tasi scolded him. Rina stayed close to Vina’s skirts, watching her hands at the churn. Vina taught her daughter how to tie a cloth over a milk pot so insects would not fall in, and how to rinse it without wasting water.

The wider valley felt less settled as Vina entered her late twenties. News came of trouble toward the plains and the routes leading west, and Loma, her market‑day contact, reported that caravans came less regularly and prices jumped. Boma’s household turned more milk into ghee for storage, and Vina’s work mattered more. She measured carefully and refused to cheat neighbors even when the stores ran low. It made borrowing easier when needed, but it also meant she carried more responsibility.

Late one autumn when she was twenty‑seven, after animals had been brought down from higher grazing, someone cut a tether in the dark and stole one of their better milk goats. In the morning Vina found the frayed rope and the empty space. She shouted for Boma, then for Haro, then accused a neighbor’s teenage son within earshot of half the lane. Boma dragged her back inside before the shouting turned into a fight. The loss hit hard. Milk fell short. Vina went to Loma to barter for a little butter and returned angry at the price. Tasi called it Vina’s fault for careless tethering. Vina threw a pot lid onto the floor and said anyone could be robbed, even a woman who never slept.

That winter her own mother, Suni, died back in Vina’s birth household. Vina went for the rites and stood beside Soma as offerings were placed—grain, a little milk, a strip of cloth. She returned to her married home quieter. She rose late when she could, then forced herself up, because the byre did not wait.

At thirty‑one, in early autumn, a fever swept through nearby households. Vina fell ill first, with chills, aching limbs, and a pounding head. Ena came again and gave her water and thin milk with salt. Vina insisted on seeing Rina and pulled the girl close, then pushed her away to keep her from catching it. After several days Vina stopped getting up. Boma moved her to the warmest part of the house and kept people from crowding her. She died on the twelfth day of the month.

Her body was washed by the household women, wrapped in cloth, and carried out at dawn. They set a small pot of curd and a pinch of grain beside her before the men took her to the family’s burial place beyond the fields.
