#   reasoning: Despite reaching 'poor but stable' adulthood, she started destitute and
#     works in a shock-prone sector (weather, crop disease, price swings), making at

# - event: During an argument over money and his suspected outside relationship, her
#     partner slapped and punched her in their yard, leaving bruises; afterward she
#     stayed for weeks with a sister nearby and later ended the cohabitation.
#   reasoning: Given she had a long-term partner relationship that ended in separation,
#     and IPV base rates are high in many settings, the chance that her confirmed victimization
#     included partner/household violence is substantial.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 40s (around 2017–2019)
#   type: domestic_violence
# - event: At a local shop/bar near market day, a dispute about a debt and “bad talk”
#     escalated and another woman struck her with a bottle and fists, causing a cut
#     that needed stitching at the clinic.
#   reasoning: Non-domestic fights/assaults happen (community disputes, market/rum-shop
#     incidents), but for a rural woman who stayed local they are less common than IPV.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late 20s (around 2004–2006)
#   type: physical_assault
# - event: As a teenager she began a sexual relationship with an older boyfriend from
#     a nearby district, meeting privately when she went to town/market or to church
#     events.
#   reasoning: Premarital sex has been common in Jamaica for decades, and legal marriage
#     often occurs later (or not at all) even when people form long-term unions.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: mid-to-late teens (ages 15–17)
#   type: premarital_sex
# - event: She became pregnant with her first child while not legally married, and the
#     baby was born while she was still living in her mother’s household and the father
#     was only visiting intermittently.
#   reasoning: Most births in Jamaica have often occurred outside legal marriage; with
#     five children and a non-marital/cohabiting/unstable union pattern, at least one
#     pregnancy outside marriage is very likely.

Daphne Williams was born on September 15, 1976 in Watt Town in the hills of Saint Ann, under Jamaica’s elected government and its hard party politics. She grew up Afro-Jamaican, speaking Patwa at home and using more formal English when the situation demanded it, with church life setting the weekly rhythm.

Her mother, Mavis, left home before daylight to clean, cook, and mind other people’s children. Daphne was the last of eleven. The yard always had somebody moving through it—older brothers coming in dusty from a day’s work, sisters tying up little ones’ hair, the radio on when there was a battery for it. Her father did not live there. Men came and went in the district, but Daphne learned early not to wait for one.

Money stayed short. When the IMF cuts and price rises hit hard in the 1980s, the effect reached right into the kitchen. Mavis cooked smaller pots. School days meant uniforms kept clean by hand and shoes patched again. Daphne went to primary school and learned to read better than she could write. She could sound out a letter and follow a Bible passage in church, but filling out forms and writing long notes stayed hard, and she hated being laughed at for it.

Sundays were strict. Mavis pushed her children up early, washed and dressed them, and walked them to church. Daphne sat through long services, sweated in the crowd, and watched who put what in the offering. Church women checked on one another. They also watched young girls.

Daphne started seeing a boyfriend from a nearby district when she was still a teenager. His name was Desmond. He was older, already doing work for cash. They met after youth meetings or on trips to town, slipping behind a shop or down a path where nobody could see. She did not talk about it with her mother. She kept her face hard at home and did not take advice easily.

At eighteen she got pregnant. Mavis found out when Daphne’s skirt stopped fitting and she began vomiting in the mornings. There was shouting, then a long stretch where Mavis spoke to her in short sentences only. Desmond came by sometimes and brought a tin of milk or a bag of rice. He did not move in. Daphne had her first child, a boy, while still in her mother’s house. She named him Andre. She went back to helping around the yard and making herself useful. She learned to bathe a baby with water warmed on the stove, to wash cloth diapers, to stretch food for one more mouth.

In the mid-1990s, when Jamaica’s financial crisis spread through the country, the strain in Watt Town showed up in the same places it always did: less work, less credit, more quarrels. People who had relied on small remittances or a steady job in town got cut off. Daphne watched shopkeepers tighten up, and she learned the rules of the “credit book” from the customer side. You paid, or you got cut off.

She built her own household in fits. She had a daughter, then another son. Not all the children had the same father. Men stayed for a while and left. Daphne did not keep peace for the sake of appearances. If she felt disrespected, she said so in front of whoever was there. That got her into arguments with neighbors and relatives. She and one older sister, Marlene, could quarrel hard and then borrow from each other the next week.

By her late twenties she was farming more steadily. She worked a small plot—yams, banana, and ground provisions—on land arranged through family connection and local agreement. She woke early, cut bush, carried water, and hauled produce to sell. She counted cash carefully, but paperwork confused her, and she often relied on someone else to read a letter or explain a bill.

In the mid-2000s she went to a shop-bar near market day to settle a small debt and buy supplies. Words moved fast. Another woman accused her of “bad talk” and disrespect. The argument shifted into the open space by the shop. The woman hit her with a bottle and then fists. Daphne fought back, but her head split above the eye. Blood ran down her face. A neighbor hauled her toward the clinic, and she got stitches and a warning to keep it clean. For weeks she kept a scarf tied over the wound and snapped at anyone who stared.

She had two more children in her thirties, a girl and then a boy, making five—three sons and two daughters. The oldest helped in the field. The girls washed dishes, swept, and learned to cook. Daphne’s household did not run soft. She expected children to move when she spoke. She also fed other people’s children when they showed up hungry, and she sent plates of food to church functions so nobody could say she gave nothing.

The HIV/AIDS years brought fear and gossip. People whispered about who was “sick-sick.” Church announcements urged testing and caution. Funerals came with extra talk and careful words. Daphne kept her own business close. She scolded her teenage daughter about men and did not want anybody bringing shame to the yard.

In 2007 and 2008, when food and fuel prices jumped, Daphne felt it in transport and inputs. Fertilizer cost more. Taxi fare to town rose. Rice and cooking oil climbed. She tried to plant more to cover the gap, but planting more still needed money.

Around 2010 to 2012, weather hit her hard. A dry spell browned the ground, then heavy rains washed through and spoiled parts of the plot. Yams rotted. Banana stems broke. She had been taking goods “on book” at the shop and could not clear the balance. She sold goats to raise cash. When that still did not cover everything, church women came with a small collection and bags of basic food. Daphne took it without crying and without thanking people too sweetly. The next week she was back in the field, replanting.

By her early forties she was living with a man named Winston. He worked when he felt like it and spent money in ways Daphne could not track. They argued about bills and about other women. One day, in the yard, the argument turned to blows. Winston slapped her and punched her, leaving bruises where her clothes would hide them. Daphne gathered a few things and went to Marlene’s house nearby with her children coming and going between yards. She stayed there for weeks. Winston sent messages through other people. Daphne did not return to live with him. They remained separated, not divorced, and she spoke of him in short, sharp phrases.

In the years after, Daphne took on more care work. Her mother aged and slowed down. A relative fell ill and needed someone to cook, bathe, and manage clinic visits. Daphne did not enjoy the work, but she did it. Her older children were grown by then, bringing small help when they could and taking their own lives more seriously than she expected.

Now, in 2025, Daphne lives in Saint Ann on the same side of the hills she was born in. She works her plot, sells what she can, and keeps close track of what she owes and what others owe her. On Sundays she goes to church, hair wrapped neat, Bible in hand. During the week she reads messages when they come on a phone screen, slowly and carefully, and asks a daughter to write down what she needs to remember. She weeds a row of young plants in the morning, cooks in the afternoon, and listens for the next shift in weather.
