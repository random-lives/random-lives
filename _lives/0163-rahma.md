#   - birth_year: 2021
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 2021
#     name: Yahya
#     narrative_role: Younger brother who dies in infancy; a quiet absence in the household.
#       His death shapes parental anxiety and overprotection, and becomes a reference
#       point in family conversations and religious life-cycle rites (aqiqah/funeral).
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Academic praise and placement in enrichment/extra tuition; also social
#       friction—peers call her 'mjuaji' (know-it-all) and adults push higher expectations.
#     scene: 'Early primary school: Rahma finishes work quickly, argues with the teacher
#       about a ''wrong'' arithmetic method, and later teaches Amina to read syllables;
#       she also picks up adult vocabulary from parents’ work talk.'
#     timing: ages 6–9 (2022–2025)
#     trait: Intelligence (97th percentile)
#   - consequence: Conflicts with adults pushing flexibility; she doubles down on routines
#       and becomes controlling with Amina ('do it my way'), but also excels in structured
#       tasks.
#     scene: Rahma resists trying unfamiliar foods/activities and dislikes changes in
#       school routines or household staff; she complains when a new curriculum/teacher
#       introduces group 'creative' tasks and prefers fixed rules and proven methods.
#     timing: ages 5–10 (2021–2026), recurring
#     trait: Very low Openness (3rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Periodic discipline meetings at school; strained friendships; parents
#       coach her on heshima (respect) and tone.
#     scene: On the school playground and at home, she is blunt, interrupts, and escalates
#       arguments quickly; she corrects relatives and refuses to apologize when she
#       feels 'right.'
#     timing: ages 6–10 (2022–2026), especially after stressors
#     trait: Low Agreeableness (10th percentile)
#   - consequence: Social visibility brings opportunities (school roles) but also more
#       clashes because her assertiveness is hard to ignore.
#     scene: She dominates group games, volunteers for presentations, befriends adults
#       easily, and enjoys leading Qur’an/holiday recitations even if not deeply observant.
#     timing: ages 4–10 (2020–2026)
#     trait: High Extraversion (81st percentile)
#   - consequence: Strong academic performance; self-pressure and occasional irritability
#       when others are 'careless.'
#     scene: Keeps tidy notebooks, insists on punctuality, and checks homework repeatedly;
#       during inflation/price talk at home, she starts tracking small expenses in a
#       notebook like her father.
#     timing: ages 7–10 (2023–2026)
#     trait: High Conscientiousness (77th percentile)
#   - consequence: Short-term anxiety spikes; parents respond with reassurance and structure
#       rather than formal mental-health treatment.
#     scene: After the serious illness episode, she becomes more vigilant (asks about
#       symptoms, worries before clinic visits), but still functions well—sleep/appetite
#       mostly normal and returns to school.
#     timing: ages 7–9 (2023–2025)
#     trait: Moderately high Neuroticism (65th percentile) without diagnosable disorder
#   - consequence: Parents emphasize accountability; small household consequences (loss
#       of privileges), reinforcing a 'results matter' atmosphere.
#     scene: Occasionally takes credit for Amina’s ideas, negotiates rules opportunistically,
#       and tests boundaries with small exaggerations to avoid blame, especially around
#       chores.
#     timing: ages 6–10 (2022–2026)
#     trait: Low Honesty-Humility (22nd percentile)
# number_of_siblings: '2'
# religion: Mostly Muslim-identified but low-observance (infrequent prayer/mosque; still
#   Ramadan/Eid and life-cycle rites)
# sibling_ages_at_death:
# - alive
# - 0
# sibling_sexes:

Rahma Rashid was born on 7 July 2016 in Segerea, in Ilala District, when Tanzania was under President John Magufuli and Dar es Salaam was swelling outward with new roads, bus routes, and construction. Her family spoke Kiswahili at home and carried a Swahili coastal identity; Islam marked the calendar more than the daily schedule. Her father, Dr. Salim Rashid, left early for work in a pressed shirt. Her mother, Neema, kept her bank-office badge on a hook by the door and ran the house by lists and reminders. Bibi Zainabu sat on the edge of family decisions, correcting children’s greetings and the angle of a headscarf.

Rahma talked easily with adults and took over games with other children. When the neighborhood kids argued over rules, she settled it fast and loudly. She wanted the same breakfast every morning and refused “new” foods, even when Neema changed brands because prices jumped. If a cousin offered a different cartoon on a phone, Rahma ended the visit early, then complained to her mother in the car. At school she finished sums before the others and walked to Mwalimu Rehema’s desk to point out an error in the method, not quietly.

Amina arrived in 2019. Rahma acted like a second parent, lifting her sister onto chairs and telling her which toys were “for big kids.” She also snapped when Amina touched her notebooks. In 2020, when COVID-19 reached the region, the adults argued about masks and crowds; Neema still kept sanitizer in her handbag, and Bibi Zainabu insisted on extra handwashing before meals.

Yahya was born in 2021 and died before the end of his first year. After that, Neema watched fevers closely. During the long rains of 2023, Rahma fell seriously ill and spent days in a private clinic where Nurse Joyce checked her temperature and drip line. She returned home thin and angry, then started asking to see the thermometer whenever anyone coughed.

Now it’s late 2025. Rahma reads quickly, keeps her school bag organized, and corrects Amina’s spelling at the table while Mama Halima serves tea and bread. Neema signs school forms, Salim checks homework, and Rahma insists everyone follow her schedule.
