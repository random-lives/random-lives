Kunu was born early in April 887 in a market town in the Mahanadi valley, where dry sal forest and scrub ran up to the edge of rice fields and tank-fed gardens. Her family lived in a three-generation house set back from the lane by the porter’s yard, where men waited to be hired to load, carry, and escort goods.

They worked under a patron who kept the town’s carts and storage sheds and decided whose labor got called first. Kunu’s father carried what the patron’s clerks pointed out: salt brought up from the coast, bolts of cloth from passing traders, grain moved after harvest, and baskets of mahua flowers and other forest produce that hill people sold in the bazaar. Wages came as measured grain more often than coin, and the measure shrank when debts were tallied.

Inside the house, Kunu’s grandmother kept the cooking place and the family’s small shrine. Red earth marked the post by the wall, and a stone sat beside it for the household spirits. On the new moon she set down a pinch of rice and a cup of water and spoke the names of the dead. When sickness moved through the lane, she paid a local ritual specialist with grain to chant and drive it away.

Kunu was the fourth child. Her two sisters carried water and collected fuel. Her brother ran errands to the yard and learned which men to avoid when tempers rose over work. Their mother spun fiber and twisted rope, then sat with other women to weave baskets and press leaf plates for dues owed to the patron’s household.

After the rains, the house ate from what was left. Grain went out to settle old balances before it went into their pot. Kunu’s mother stopped nursing early so she could take more work outside the house and keep her place with the patron’s women. Kunu was fed thin rice-water and a little gruel when there was enough.

She stopped putting on weight. Her cries weakened, and her skin loosened over her arms and legs. By the start of January she could not keep even water down. On the morning of January 2, 888, she lay on a mat near the hearth, breathed shallowly, and died before midday.
