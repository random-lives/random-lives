#     narrative_role: Second child and first surviving son. Born after a few years of

Mira was born into a small Uto‑Aztecan–speaking forager band that moved between springs, dry washes, and sheltered rock overhangs on the high desert plateau where the Mazapil country lies. No chiefs ruled her camp. Decisions sat with older men and women, with disputes handled face to face and alliances kept through visits and shared meals. Her family spoke to the places they depended on—certain hills, a spring with a salt edge, a stand of thorny shrubs—using short prayers and song before digging or hunting.

Her mother, Luma, carried her in a sling while gathering seeds and cutting cactus fruit, stopping to grind the day’s take on a stone. Her father, Pira, shaped flakes from cores and kept bone awls and wooden shafts in order. At camp he fixed a net, re-tied cordage, and set sharp edges into handles with resin. When meat came in, he cut portions with a fresh edge and passed the first pieces to the elders nearby.

Late in Mira’s first cool season, stomach sickness moved through the camp after a visit from another band. She began passing watery stool and could not keep milk. Luma fed her often and held her to shade, then tried thin broth from a small potstone cup.

Mira died before her first year. Pira dug into a patch of soft ground near a rock shelter above the wash. They laid her wrapped in hide, set a pinch of red pigment on the bundle, and sang a short camp song before closing the earth.
