#     name: Luma
#     narrative_role: Primary caregiver. General gatherer-caretaker; likely attentive
#       and protective, with caregiving shaped by constant water-fetching, food processing,
#       and infant-carrying. Survives Mira’s birth and goes on to have four more children,

#     name: Mira
#     narrative_role: Firstborn. Lived only through her first seasons; remembered indirectly
#       through her parents’ stories and the way her short life shaped later care practices
#       (extra vigilance about water, cleanliness, breastfeeding, and moving camp).

#     name: Toka
#     narrative_role: Second child and first surviving son. Born after a few years of
#       spacing; becomes the steady older-brother figure to the younger siblings, often
#       positioned as the reliable helper—learning tracking and tool use early and later
#       acting as a provider and camp organizer.

#     name: Naya
#     narrative_role: Third child. Close in age to Toka, more risk-prone and restless;
#       likely the one who ranges farther, takes on demanding tasks, and dies relatively
#       young for an adult—his shorter lifespan becoming a cautionary family memory.

#     name: Kona

#       family’s ‘memory-keeper’—the one who remembers old camps, waterholes, and kin
#       ties. In later life he is an elder presence for nieces/nephews.

#     name: Sima
#     narrative_role: Youngest child. A late baby after the three sons, dies in infancy;

#       of life are precarious, especially in dry-country seasons.
#     sex: F

Mira was born into a small forager band that moved between springs, dry washes, and sheltered rock overhangs on the high desert plateau where the Mazapil country lies. No chiefs ruled her camp. The oldest man and woman settled disputes and chose when to move; alliances with neighboring bands came through marriage and shared hunts. Her family sang to the places they depended on—a certain hill, a spring with a salt edge, a stand of mesquite—before digging roots or setting snares.

Her mother, Lunash, carried her in a sling while gathering seeds and cutting cactus fruit, stopping to grind the day's take on a flat stone. Her father, Pitok, shaped flakes from cores and kept bone awls and wooden shafts in order. At camp he fixed a net, re-tied cordage, and set sharp edges into handles with resin. When meat came in, he cut portions and passed the first pieces to the two old people who shared their fire circle.

Late in Mira's first cool season, a stomach illness moved through the camp after a visit from another band. She began passing watery stool and could not keep milk. Lunash fed her often and held her in shade, then tried thin broth from a small potstone cup.

Mira died before her first year. Pitok dug into soft ground near a rock shelter above the wash. They laid her wrapped in hide, set a pinch of red pigment on the bundle, and sang a short camp song before closing the earth.

<!--
**Issues found:**
- [Pass 11] "Uto-Aztecan-speaking" is an anachronistic linguistic classification for the narrative
- [Pass 12] All three names (Mira, Luma, Pira) are CVCV pattern—violates naming diversity rule
- [Pass 9] "stomach sickness" acceptable but "stomach illness" slightly better
- [Pass 7] "Decisions sat with older men and women" was a mechanical list
- [Pass 2] "elders nearby" was vague—who specifically?

**Changes made:**
- Removed "Uto-Aztecan-speaking" from opening
- Changed mother's name from Luma to Lunash (CVCCVC pattern)
- Changed father's name from Pira to Pitok (CVCVC pattern)
- Rewrote political structure sentence to be more concrete ("oldest man and woman settled disputes")
- Changed "elders nearby" to "two old people who shared their fire circle" for specificity
- "stomach sickness" → "stomach illness"
- Small fixes: "spoke to the places" → "sang to the places" (more concrete); "held her to shade" → "held her in shade"
