#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-5
#     key_events:
#     - Born into a female-headed temple/estate labor household; early caregiving shared
#       by mother Anniya, grandmother Zalpa, and oldest sister Hantiliya.
#     - Learns household offering routines at the hearth/shrine (small pours of beer/water,
#       bits of bread) as protection after earlier infant deaths.
#     - Begins simple errands within the compound; his small stature is noticed and
#       commented on, but his bold talkativeness wins indulgence.
#     phase: Infancy and early childhood
#   - age_range: 6-10
#     key_events:
#     - 'Hittite-style estate organization tightens locally: more tallies, more scheduled
#       workdays; he is used as a messenger because he is quick and socially fearless.'
#     - Death of grandmother Zalpa (age 7), increasing household workload for mother
#       and older sisters; Tiwati becomes more central.
#     - 'First sustained exposure to temple/estate festival mobilizations: communal
#       labor and offerings on designated days.'
#     phase: Later childhood (increasing estate demands)
#   - age_range: 11-13
#     key_events:
#     - 'Shift toward regular runner/porter duties: deliveries between storehouse, fields,
#       and overseer’s post; becomes known for talking his way through gates and persuading
#       others.'
#     - 'Household authority changes after Hantiliya’s death (when he is ~10): fewer
#       adult protectors; mother leans on him more.'
#     - 'Economic squeeze years intensify: more ration scrutiny, more pressure to meet
#       quotas (sets stage for crisis incident).'
#     phase: Early adolescence (work role solidifies)
#   - age_range: 14-16
#     key_events:
#     - Chronic intestinal illness becomes a recurring limitation; he tries to keep
#       working through it to avoid ration penalties.
#     - Aruna’s death (when he is ~11) lingers in memory; he becomes more outwardly
#       performative—jokes, boasts, loud friendliness—to keep fear at bay.
#     - Dies at 16 (March 11, -1472) after terminal work-related exposure/poisoning;
#       household conducts modest rites and offerings rather than elaborate temple burial.
#     phase: Mid-adolescence (illness and declining capacity)

#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Gains small privileges (first in line, extra sip of beer, leniency)
#       but also becomes highly visible—blamed quickly when deliveries go missing or
#       messages are misunderstood.
#     scene: As a boy he inserts himself into adult conversations at the storehouse
#       gate, joking with guards and repeating news; he becomes the default messenger
#       because he is unafraid to approach overseers.
#     timing: ages 7-16 (especially 11-16 in runner role)
#     trait: Extraversion (96th percentile)
#   - consequence: Helps him function under pressure, but can lead him to underestimate
#       risks (drinking dubious water, pushing through illness).
#     scene: During ration scoldings and threats, he stays outwardly calm, even cheeky,
#       and recovers quickly after humiliation; he treats danger as manageable rather
#       than paralyzing.
#     timing: ages 11-16
#     trait: Low neuroticism (22nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Reliable and steady in routine tasks, but slow to adopt safer alternatives
#       (boiling water, changing routes) even when sickness suggests it.
#     scene: He prefers familiar routes, familiar work crews, and household rituals;
#       he is skeptical of novel omens/foreign practices and repeats 'the way mother
#       does it' when disputes arise.
#     timing: ages 6-16
#     trait: Low openness (26th percentile)
#   - consequence: Builds a reputation as 'loud but not soft,' deterring some bullying,
#       yet occasionally draws reprimands that threaten the household’s standing.
#     scene: He is friendly but quick to argue; if another youth cuts the ration line
#       or mocks his height, he responds with sharp words and escalating dares rather
#       than backing down.
#     timing: ages 10-16
#     trait: Lower agreeableness (33rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Limits advancement into heavier labor roles; increases reliance on
#       messenger/porter work and the associated exposure to contaminated water and
#       storehouse materials.
#     scene: He is assigned loads that 'fit his size' and teased by peers; he compensates
#       by taking the fastest routes, talking his way into tasks, and volunteering for
#       errands needing quick movement rather than brute strength.
#     timing: ages 7-16
#     trait: Short stature (4th percentile height)
# number_of_children: '0'
# number_of_siblings: '7'
# occupation: General estate servant/runner/porter (errands, carrying, assisting overseers;
#   not literate)
# religion: 'Household cult: regular food/drink offerings at home (hearth/house shrine),
#   prayers to local Storm/Fertility gods, and ancestor/village protective rites'

# structured_incidents:
# - event: After a poor harvest and tightened temple/estate rationing, his mother’s
#     household fell into arrears on labor and grain dues; to keep access to barley
#     rations and avoid penalties, they had to pawn household goods (tools/blankets)
#     and send him more regularly as a runner/porter for overseers instead of keeping
#     him on home tasks.
#   reasoning: Temple/estate labor households were already near-subsistence and vulnerable
#     to shortfalls; a female-headed household with an absent father raises risk of
#     debt, ration loss, or destitution episodes.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 11–13 (sustained period, worsening over multiple seasons)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: From early adolescence he suffered recurring bouts of intestinal sickness—abdominal
#     cramps and debilitating diarrhea—that flared especially after drinking from field
#     channels/springs while running errands, leaving him weak and periodically unable
#     to carry loads for days at a time.
#   reasoning: Chronic conditions (e.g., recurrent fevers/parasites, respiratory disease,
#     lingering infection) were common, but many would be hard to distinguish from repeated
#     acute illness and might not produce a single discrete 'incident' unless clearly
#     limiting.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 12–16 (recurring pattern with intermittent severe episodes)
#   type: chronic_illness

Targasnalli was born the last of eight children in a Luwian-speaking village on the southern Anatolian uplands, where temple estates took grain, wool, and labor and sent orders down through overseers. The household kept to the local mix of Anatolian cult practice: a clay stand by the hearth, a small bowl for beer, and bits of bread set aside for the Storm God and for dead kin whose names were still spoken.

His mother, Anniya, ran the household without a resident husband. When people asked after the father, she answered in short phrases and shifted the talk to work. In the compound there was always a woman's voice giving instructions. His grandmother Zalpa nursed him and carried him on her hip while she ground grain; his oldest sister Hantiliya, already twelve when he was born, took over when the grinding needed two hands. Three other sisters filled the household: Tiwati, three years older, steady and watchful; Luli, five years older, who carried water jars and sang while she worked; and Aruna, only a year older, the one nearest his age.

The family had already buried three children. An infant sister, Pirwa, had died before Targasnalli was born; another, Mara, had lived one year. His only brother, Arnuwi, had died the year Targasnalli was born, at seven—old enough that adults still spoke of him. When Anniya poured the first drink each evening, she tipped a few drops to the floor and said the names in a fixed order.

Targasnalli grew up small. When the other children climbed onto low roofs or wrestled in dust, he pushed in anyway, loud and quick with insults and jokes. A cousin once called him "little bones," and he chased the boy the length of the threshing yard, stopping only when Hantiliya grabbed his ear.

When he was six, Luli sickened and died. She had been old enough to carry water jars, and then her place at the hearth went empty. The next year, Zalpa died.

That same year the estate's demands sharpened. Word came that the Great King in Hattusa wanted more grain, more wool, more labor. Kuwalanaziti, the overseer, began arriving with a tally stick and a man who carried a seal. Labor days were counted more tightly, and grain deliveries prompted more arguments over measures. Targasnalli ran messages between the overseer's post and the storehouse gate, because he walked fast and talked faster. Happiya, the gate-keeper, liked news. Targasnalli fed him small talk—who had a new calf, who fought with a neighbor, who complained about ration measures—and got waved through without waiting.

At eleven, Hantiliya died at twenty-two. She had been the one who could face Kuwalanaziti without shrinking and argue over measures without flinching. After that, Anniya leaned harder on Targasnalli and on Tiwati, who took over much of the grinding and food work that Hantiliya had managed. The following year brought a bad harvest, and the estate tightened rations. Before the harvest was in, Aruna took a fever and died at thirteen. She had been the sister nearest his age, the one who teased him when he preened for the guards, calling him "little man" in a singsong. After her burial, he talked even more. He interrupted adults, repeated jokes twice if the first telling did not land, and pushed himself into the center of any group that would have him.

The household scrambled. Anniya brought a blanket and a bronze awl to her sister's house and returned with grain on credit. She sent Targasnalli out constantly as a runner and porter: a jar of oil to a shrine helper, a bundle of flax, a sack of barley from the storehouse to the millstone yard. He learned which overseer wanted deference and which wanted speed. He argued his way out of punishments with bright, shameless confidence until he met someone who enjoyed slapping boys. After that he kept his mouth running but his hands still.

On errand days he drank from field channels and springs without thinking. By twelve the stomach cramps had become familiar—days of diarrhea that left him lightheaded and slow. Anniya boiled water when she could, but fuel was scarce and the household could not spare him from work whenever he doubled over. Pazunuwa, an older porter, mocked him when he lagged and then used him anyway, sending him on extra trips because Targasnalli could talk guards into opening gates. Between bouts of sickness he gambled with knucklebones, shouted at the throws until elders scowled, and took quiet pride in knowing every shortcut between fields, pens, and shrine. He liked the first cup of thin beer after a long run. He liked being greeted by name at the gate.

At sixteen he was still small, still quick, still talking, though the recurring stomach sickness had left him thinner than before. After carrying loads for Kuwalanaziti during a stretch of heavy estate work, he handled a jar of leather tanning solution in a workshop yard and then ate without washing. The cramps came back harder than usual. He vomited, retched again, and could not keep water down. Years of intestinal illness had worn his body down; what a stronger body might have thrown off in days became something he could not survive. Anniya and Tiwati laid him by the hearth and offered bread and beer at the clay stand, naming the Storm God and the household dead. His body was washed, wrapped in a cloth, and carried to a burial place near the settlement; they set a small bowl and a little barley beside him and sealed the spot with stones.
