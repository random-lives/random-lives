# ethnicity: Han (Huaxia) agrarian people of the Eastern Han heartland
# father_occupation: Smallholder subsistence farmer (millet/wheat dry-field cultivation;
#   taxes and corvée)
# historical_context:
# - event: Imperial state taxation and corvée labor demands (road/irrigation works,
#     transport service, periodic conscription levies) that structured the agricultural
#     calendar and household labor availability.
#   timing: throughout life, especially ages 15–45
# - event: Local impacts of late Eastern Han court factional struggles and purges (e.g.,
#     recurring crackdowns on 'partisans' and shifts in local administration), producing
#     instability in county governance and enforcement.
#   timing: notably 160s–170s (ages ~17–37)
# - event: Regional flood risk and river-control failures on the Yellow River system,
#     causing field inundation, siltation, and emergency labor or relief efforts in
#     affected years.
#   timing: intermittent across life; higher likelihood in adulthood ages 20–49
# - event: Drought/irregular rainfall and consequent grain price spikes and shortfalls
#     (including the need to substitute foods, sell assets, or seek loans) typical of
#     north China dry-field farming.
#   timing: intermittent; especially likely at least once ages 25–45
# - event: Late Eastern Han epidemics/large sickness waves in densely settled regions
#     (fever and dysentery-type outbreaks) periodically raising mortality and disrupting
#     labor and markets.
#   timing: intermittent; plausible multiple waves, especially ages 10–49

#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: 167
#     death_age: 1
#     death_year: 168
#     name: Zhao Yong
#     narrative_role: Only son; brief survival makes Shun’s sense of obligation and

#     death_age: 59
#     death_year: 229
#     name: Zhao E
#     narrative_role: Surviving child; becomes Shun’s main family bond in later life.
#       As a young adult she helps manage household tasks during his chronic chest illness;
#       later marries out, but remains emotionally important.
#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 6
#     connection: Starts when he is trusted with more serious chores (grain drying,
#       tool care); mistakes trigger beatings. This shapes his extreme agreeableness
#       (appeasing) and anxious hypervigilance.
#     incident: childhood_abuse
#   - age: 10
#     connection: Peak severity during successive heavy seasons; father’s frustration
#       at labor shortages and corvée demands spills into the household.
#     incident: childhood_abuse
#   - age: 31
#     connection: Begins after marital separation and increased household vulnerability
#       (less adult labor/guarding). Losses are tied to market-day traffic and weakened
#       neighborhood trust.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 35
#     connection: Tool theft forces him to borrow/owe favors, tightening dependence
#       on kin and increasing anxiety about future planting schedules.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 41
#     connection: Onset overlaps with heightened regional disorder and his mother’s
#       decline/death; reduced resilience and winter crowding/smoke exposure aggravate
#       symptoms.
#     incident: chronic_illness
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-5
#     key_events:
#     - Born 143 in a smallholder household near the Huang He plain; early learning
#       is practical (chores, tool-handling), not schooling.
#     - Begins showing anxious vigilance (startles easily at storms/illness; frequent
#       stomach complaints) and strong compliance to keep peace.
#     - 'First exposure to state demands indirectly: father summoned for short corvée
#       stints; household labor tightens.'
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 6-16
#     key_events:
#     - Sustained harsh discipline from father during planting/harvest; Shun learns
#       to placate and yield rather than argue.
#     - 'Develops very low openness in practice: distrust of new tools/seed varieties
#       and suspicion of outsiders’ advice; prefers inherited routines even when inefficient.'
#     - Teen years include corvée training/rotations (transport, ditch work) and first
#       real awareness of county authority and punishments.
#     phase: Later childhood and adolescence
#   - age_range: 17-29
#     key_events:
#     - Marriage to Chen Shi around 164 as a standard rural alliance; household tries
#       to stabilize labor and produce heirs.
#     - Three births (165, 167, 170) with two infant deaths; repeated sickness seasons
#       and funeral obligations deepen his anxiety and somatic complaints.
#     - 'Late 160s–170s: local governance feels harsher/less predictable amid wider
#       factional politics; Shun becomes more conflict-avoidant and passive in disputes.'
#     phase: Young adulthood and marriage
#   - age_range: 30-40
#     key_events:
#     - After the de facto separation (by ~176), Shun continues farming and household
#       maintenance; his surviving daughter remains with him rather than his estranged
#       wife.
#     - 'Experiences a run of difficult years: at least one drought/price spike and
#       some flood threat, pushing borrowing and tightening grain storage practices.'
#     - Property crime begins to recur (grain and small livestock losses, stolen tool),
#       reinforcing mistrust and worry about neighbors and market crowds.
#     phase: 'Middle adulthood: farming under pressure'
#   - age_range: 41-49
#     key_events:
#     - From ~184, Yellow Turban-era disorder brings troop movements/requisitions rumors
#       and heightened insecurity; his mother’s death around this time removes a key
#       support.
#     - Chronic chest illness develops (winter-worsened cough, fevers, sweats); labor
#       capacity declines and he becomes more dependent on his surviving child and nearby
#       kin.
#     - Dies in 192, likely during a period of ongoing local instability; household
#       at death is a small stem-family unit centered on him and his surviving child.
#     phase: 'Later adulthood: chronic illness and unrest'
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Zhao Bo
#     prominence: ages 25–49, especially 41–49
#     relationship: paternal cousin (neighboring household in same village cluster);
#       occasional work partner and later key helper during Shun’s illness
#   - name: Chen Ru
#     prominence: ages 32–34 (around separation aftermath)
#     relationship: wife’s elder brother; intermediary during the de facto separation
#       and negotiations over child residence and goods
#   - name: Old Meng
#     prominence: ages 22–27 and 41–48
#     relationship: local ritual specialist/diviner consulted during infant illnesses
#       and later during Shun’s chronic cough
#   - name: Xu the Runner
#     prominence: intermittent, strongest ages 16–45
#     relationship: county yamen runner/messenger who posts corvée notices and enforces
#       levies; symbol of state pressure
#   partners:
#   - name: Chen Shi
#     narrative_role: Wife in a locally arranged match. Early years marked by Shun’s
#       chronic disorganization and avoidance, and her frustration with insecure provisioning;
#       separation becomes de facto after escalating household conflict and pressures
#       as Shun’s father ages. No formal divorce; she returns to her natal village/kin
#       network.
#     relationship_end_year: 176
#     relationship_start_year: 164
#   siblings: []
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Missed opportunities to adapt to drought/price swings; reinforces
#       family criticism that he is 'stuck' and fuels his own worry when harvests disappoint.
#     scene: Refuses to try a neighbor’s suggested change in sowing timing or a different
#       grain mix, insisting on the pattern his father taught even after a poor yield
#       year.
#     timing: middle adulthood (ages 30–40)
#     trait: Openness (very low)
#   - consequence: Conflicts with spouse and neighbors; contributes to estrangement
#       and makes the household more vulnerable to losses and debt.
#     scene: Repeatedly misplaces or neglects maintenance of tools and forgets agreed
#       exchange obligations (returning borrowed implements late), despite understanding
#       the practical stakes.
#     timing: from adolescence into adulthood (ages 14–40)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (very low)
#   - consequence: Maintains a reputation as 'soft' and dependable but sometimes gets
#       exploited; also helps him secure aid during illness.
#     scene: Yields in disputes over irrigation turns and boundary quarrels, offering
#       extra labor or a portion of grain to keep peace even when he feels wronged.
#     timing: adult life (ages 20–49)
#     trait: Agreeableness (very high)
#   - consequence: Improves short-term decision-making and detection of problems, but
#       cannot translate into formal advancement due to illiteracy and low conscientiousness.
#     scene: Quickly does mental tallies of seed-to-yield risk and prices, and spots
#       patterns in who comes near the grain jars after market days, even without literacy.
#     timing: middle adulthood (ages 28–38)
#     trait: Intelligence (high)
#   - consequence: Short temper under stress is rare (high agreeableness), but avoidance
#       and indecision increase; contributes to marital breakdown and makes chronic
#       illness feel more debilitating.
#     scene: Frequent stomach tightness, insomnia before corvée summons or during a
#       child’s fever; repeatedly checks granary seals and re-counts stored grain, ruminating
#       about 'what will happen this winter.'
#     timing: noticeable from late childhood; strongest in family-loss years and during
#       unrest (ages 8–49, peaking 165–170 and 184–192)
#     trait: Anxiety disorder (persistent worry with somatic symptoms)
# number_of_children: '3'
# number_of_siblings: '0'
# occupation: Dry-field cereal farmer (millet/wheat) as primary occupation (smallholder/tenant
#   mix typical of the area)
# religion: Household ancestor offerings + worship/propitiation of local deities/spirits
#   (kitchen/door/earth gods, river/field spirits), with seasonal/village rites
# structured_incidents:
# - event: 'Recurring pattern: over several years, small but damaging thefts hit his
#     household—grain was quietly taken from the storage jars after market days and
#     a chicken/piglet disappeared from the yard; once, a plow-iron/tool was stolen
#     from the field edge, forcing him to borrow or pay to replace it.'
#   reasoning: Smallholders regularly faced petty theft (grain/tools/animals) and occasional
#     robbery, especially around markets and during local disorder; even without major
#     migration, victimization at least once is fairly plausible over 49 years.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 30–38
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: 'Sustained period: as an only child, he was harshly beaten and verbally degraded
#     by his father during planting/harvest seasons when work was urgent—punished for
#     mistakes with tools, slow chores, or spilling grain, sometimes left hungry or
#     locked out briefly as discipline.'
#   reasoning: Even in intact rural households, corporal punishment and harsh discipline
#     were common; as an only child he may have received focused pressure rather than
#     neglect, but severe beatings/neglect still occurred at a meaningful rate.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 6–12
#   type: childhood_abuse
# - event: 'Sustained period: he developed a long-running chest illness with bouts of
#     cough, low fever, night sweats, and exhaustion that worsened in winter; he could
#     still work some days but often fell behind, relying on his son and kin for heavy
#     tasks.'
#   reasoning: Endemic infections and untreated conditions often became chronic (recurrent
#     fevers, chronic digestive problems, arthritis-like pain); this is especially plausible
#     given he later died of a chronic wasting disease.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 41–49
#   type: chronic_illness

Zhao Shun was born on the first day of the fifth month in 143, in a hamlet of the Eastern Han empire near the bend of the Yellow River plain. Everyone around him spoke the local Sinitic vernacular. The county yamen set the taxes, the labor drafts, and the punishments. In the household, the dead mattered as much as the living. A low table near the north wall held a bowl for millet and a cup for poured ale at the new and full moons, offered to the Zhao ancestors whose names were spoken from memory.

His father, Zhao Qiu, worked dry fields of millet and wheat and kept a stubborn pig that rooted at the fence line. Qiu’s temper rose with the weather and the calendar. When a summons came for transport duty, Qiu cursed the runner who brought it and then turned on the yard, snapping at his wife, Liu Shi, about how the bundles had been tied. Liu Shi spun hemp and tended the kitchen garden; she also watched Shun closely for signs of sickness. Shun grew into a quiet child who stayed near her when he could, and who learned early to keep his hands busy—twisting rope, sorting chaff, mending a broken basket rim—because idleness drew his father’s eye.

At six, Qiu put him to heavier chores. Shun carried sheaves, kept birds off the drying grain, and tried to handle tools too big for his arms. That was the age when the beatings began and then became routine. When Shun spilled a measure of millet, Qiu struck him with a switch cut from the hedgerow and made him kneel on hard-packed earth until the light failed. When Shun let a chicken into the grain yard, Qiu shoved him into the doorway and barred it for a while, leaving him outside until Liu Shi came and argued him back in. Shun learned the shape of his father’s anger: worst at planting and harvest, worst on days when corvée took men away and the household work fell behind.

He carried the fear into his body. Before storms, his belly tightened and he sat squatting behind the woodpile, chewing on a strip of reed until his jaw hurt. When his mother left for the well, he checked the gate and counted the animals again, then checked again. He did not enjoy change. If a neighbor brought a new style of hoe from a market town, Shun held it, tested its edge, then set it down and reached for the older tool he knew.

By his teens he joined the rotations of labor the county demanded. He hauled baskets of earth for ditches and carried loads for transport service when the runner, Xu, read names from a bamboo strip. Shun was bright enough to catch instructions quickly and to calculate how much seed they could spare, but he forgot details others kept straight. He promised to bring a tool to a work site and left it leaning by the gate. He agreed to return borrowed rope and returned it late, then tried to smooth things over with extra help. He yielded easily, sometimes too easily, letting an older youth take his place at a water turn without a fight. He hated arguments. When he heard raised voices he walked away to the edge of the field and pretended to pull weeds.

At twenty-one, in 164, Qiu arranged his marriage with a woman from a nearby village, Chen Shi. She came with a small chest of cloth and a cooking pot, and she walked into the Zhao yard with her hair pinned and her eyes already measuring what she had married into. Shun wanted peace between people, so he agreed with her quickly, smiled even when he did not understand what she wanted, and said yes to more than he could deliver. He also lost track of things. He forgot to patch the roof before the rains. He left a sickle out and it rusted. Chen Shi complained in a steady voice and then, when the household heard her, she raised it.

Their first child, Zhao Lan, was born in 165 and died the same day. Liu Shi washed the infant, wrapped her, and placed her in a small wooden box. Shun carried it out at dawn, with his father walking behind him and saying nothing. The second child, Zhao Yong, arrived in 167, a boy with strong lungs at first. He lived through one winter and died in 168 after days of fever and loose stool. Shun spent nights sitting on a low stool beside the sleeping mat, listening for the boy’s breath, then jumping up to check again. He went to Old Meng, a local diviner, and paid with grain for a talisman strip and instructions to burn it and mix the ash with water. He did what he was told, then blamed himself when it changed nothing.

A daughter, Zhao E, was born in 170. Shun held her with care, and then with worry. He pressed his palm against her chest when she slept. He argued with Chen Shi about the smoke from the cooking fire and about visitors who came with coughs. He also forgot the small steps that made a household run. He let grain sit too long before airing it. He promised he would repair a fence and then went to help a neighbor and returned at dark with nothing fixed. He apologized too much, which only angered Chen Shi more.

In the 160s and 170s, the county’s mood shifted. Officials changed, runners grew rougher, and talk spread of men arrested for factional disputes far away. None of it put books in Shun’s hands. He could not read, and the written proclamations posted at the yamen gate meant nothing until someone recited them. What he felt was the tightening: more inspections, sharper collection, less patience. He met it by trying to offend no one. When a boundary dispute rose with a neighbor, Shun offered a strip of land rather than argue. When a cousin, Zhao Bo, teased him for giving in, Shun shrugged and said he needed quiet to sleep.

By 176, Chen Shi left the Zhao household. The break happened in stages, but it ended that year. A quarrel over stored grain—Shun had promised part of it to a cousin who had helped with harvest and then could not remember how much—turned into shouting in front of the yard. Chen Shi took her remaining cloth and returned to her brother Chen Ru’s house. There was no formal repudiation, no neat settlement. Shun did not chase her or argue with her brother. He agreed to whatever Chen Ru demanded just to end the confrontation. Zhao E stayed with Shun, small enough to be carried on his hip when he went to the fields.

Qiu died in 176. Shun dug the grave with help from Zhao Bo and a few neighbors. At the funeral meal he poured ale for the ancestors and for his father’s spirit, hands shaking as he steadied the cup. After that, the household was smaller and quieter, but the work did not get easier. He kept planting the same way his father had taught, refusing advice to shift the sowing when the rains were late. When drought came and grain prices rose, he tried to calculate how long the stored millet would last, then woke in the night and checked the jars again.

In the years that followed, thefts began to bite. Grain disappeared from the storage jars after busy market days when strangers moved through. A piglet vanished from the yard. Once, a plow-iron left at the field edge was gone by morning. Shun noticed patterns—who passed by, who lingered—but he did not confront anyone. He borrowed a replacement from Zhao Bo and paid back with labor, digging and hauling until his shoulders ached. He tried new jar seals and checked them too often, touching each knot, then touching again, then lying awake imagining footsteps outside.

He found small pleasures that did not cost him anything. In late autumn he liked roasted millet cakes browned on a clay griddle, eaten outside while the air turned cold. He sat on a low stone by the threshing floor at dusk, listening to other households' laughter carry across the yard lines. He let Zhao E braid rushes into simple mats and praised her work with a few words, then fell silent.

Liu Shi died in 184. The same year, rumors of rebellion reached their villages and then became facts: men with yellow cloths, soldiers moving through commanderies, demands for grain and labor. His stomach clenched before every knock at the gate. He avoided the market when he could, sending Zhao Bo instead, and when he did go he walked the edges and kept his eyes down.

That same year, he began to cough in the mornings. By the next winter the cough came at night. He sweated through his shirt and woke shivering. He still went to the fields, but he stopped often, hands on knees, catching his breath. Zhao E carried water and took over tasks he could no longer keep pace with, and Zhao Bo came more frequently, cutting stalks and lifting loads without being asked. Shun paid him back with what he could: a share of grain, a repaired handle when his hands were steady, a promise remembered at last.

Old Meng gave him another talisman and told him to avoid cold foods and spirits that came with damp wind. Shun obeyed. He also worried more. He worried about requisitions from troops, about rumors of bandits, about the next winter, about the cough that would not leave. He spoke little, but when he did, it was to ask if the gate was barred, if the jars were sealed, if Zhao E had stayed away from sick children.

He died on December 11, 192, in the room where the family kept their ancestor table. Zhao Bo and Zhao E washed the body and dressed him in plain garments. They placed him in a simple coffin and buried him in the family plot, setting bowls of millet and a cup of ale by the grave before packing the earth down.
