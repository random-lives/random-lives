#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 37
#     connection: Occurs during a period of tighter revenue demands and heightened suspicion;
#       Ramachandra’s drinking and lax oversight (low conscientiousness) contributes

#       with certain neighbors.
#     incident: perpetrator_violence (physical assault perpetrated)
#   - age: 34
#     connection: A severe fever with weeks of weakness (or a farm injury) reduces his

#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds wide ties and information flow, but increases exposure to
#       conflict and drinking settings; reputation as 'too forward' with other men’s
#       households.
#     scene: At market days and festival nights he is the loudest talker—negotiating
#       cattle hire, telling stories, drawing a crowd, then lingering with drink companions
#       while others go home.
#     timing: Adolescence through adulthood (ages 14-45)
#     trait: Extraversion (very high)
#   - consequence: Makes him socially interesting and adaptable, but also seen as disrespectful
#       of tradition; fuels wandering at fairs and experimentation with drink.
#     scene: He is fascinated by traveling performers and pilgrims; he repeats new songs
#       and tries unfamiliar remedies/ritual variations, arguing with elders that 'there
#       are many ways to please the goddess.'
#     timing: Adolescence and early marriage (ages 15-30)
#     trait: Openness (very high)
#   - consequence: Contributes to household friction and vulnerability to theft; Mahadev
#       increasingly supervises him and limits his control over stores.
#     scene: He delays repairs to the grain store latch and leaves measuring pots unreturned,
#       trusting 'it will be fine'; work starts late after drinking nights.
#     timing: Most visible after marriage (ages 22-40)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (low)
#   - consequence: Leads to fights (both as victim and perpetrator), damages alliances,
#       and increases reliance on kin mediation.
#     scene: In disputes he uses cutting humor and refuses to back down, even when elders
#       signal him to soften; he escalates quarrels over boundaries and debts.
#     timing: Adulthood (ages 25-45)
#     trait: Agreeableness (low)
#   - consequence: Reinforces alcohol use and short temper; drives more frequent ritual
#       expenditures and vows.
#     scene: After deaths/illness in the compound he becomes restless and irritable,
#       sleeping poorly, seeking drink to calm himself, and obsessing over omens and
#       the goddess’s displeasure.
#     timing: Spikes during caregiving/illness periods (ages 18-49)
#     trait: Neuroticism (moderately high)
#   - consequence: Marital conflict and violence, reduced reliability in farm management,
#       heightened risk of assault and theft vulnerability, and worsening standing with
#       elders though he remains within the substantial cultivator tier.
#     scene: Regular toddy/rice-beer drinking at market/festival gatherings shifts into
#       morning drinking in hard seasons; he misses field tasks, sells small amounts
#       of grain for liquor, and returns home argumentative, sometimes violent.
#     timing: Onset ages 24-28; most impairing ages 30-45; fluctuates afterward
#     trait: Alcohol use disorder (must be visible)
#   - consequence: Helps prevent complete social collapse or severe legal punishment;
#       allows partial repair of relationships after conflicts.
#     scene: Despite quarrels, he is reluctant to outright cheat in measures when watched
#       and sometimes insists on compensating a neighbor after a fight, especially under
#       elder pressure.

#     trait: Honesty-Humility (moderately high)

Ramachandra was born on April 17, 1601, in Surada, a cluster of houses and fields in the damp green country of southern Odisha. The village lay under layered authority—local headmen and intermediaries answering up to bigger powers pressing from the Deccan—so a farmer learned early that grain and labor were counted by men who did not plough. His household spoke Odia and kept Shakta rites close, with the village goddess treated as a protector that also demanded attention.

He came last. Six older siblings had arrived before him, and only one—his brother Mahadev—would live past his childhood. The firstborn, Gopinath, had died in 1587 before he could be carried to the courtyard for the first washing. Another sister, Nilambarī, was lost at birth. There were others: Durgacharanī dead at two, Shyāmā dead at one. Only Harisankarī, born in 1596, grew tall enough to braid her hair and carry water pots. After Shyāmā’s death in 1600, the women in the compound tightened their rules. When Ramachandra cried too long, his grandmother Tulasi spat a little water and drew a smear of ash on his forehead. A lemon with red thread hung from a beam over the sleeping mat. On Tuesdays and Fridays she set a small leaf-cup of rice, salt, and a pinch of turmeric at the threshold, and in the month of heavy rains she offered a bit of goat blood at the village shrine.

The joint household was crowded: his father Gadadhar, owner of good plots and cattle, his mother Padmā who ran the kitchen and stores, and his grandfather Nilakantha who sat on a low stool in the courtyard and judged everyone’s speech. Ramachandra learned to keep his eyes down in front of Nilakantha, then forgot and talked anyway. He liked noise. He chased the older boys to the tank, shouted across the bunds, and bargained for roasted gram at the small stalls when a fair came near. When his father sent him to watch calves, he returned with long stories about a traveling singer and the jokes the men told by the toddy pot.

Harisankarī did the steady work of keeping him out of trouble. She slapped his hand away from the fire, tied his loincloth when it loosened, and pulled him back when he tried to join older boys at a dice mat. In 1608, when men argued at the edge of a paddy about a boundary line, he stood close and listened, repeating the sharpest insults later. Gadadhar heard and struck him once, hard, in front of the courtyard. Ramachandra did not cry. He waited until the elders turned away, then spat into the dust and mouthed the insult again.

Nilakantha died in 1616, and the household’s weight shifted. Mahadev, already grown, began taking the lead in the fields, while Gadadhar pushed harder, worried about dues and labor demands. That year Ramachandra carried messages between hamlets, hauled manure, and learned to drive oxen. He never learned letters. When a man offered to show him how to scratch his name on a palm leaf, he lost interest after a few tries, then wandered off to watch a drum group rehearse for a festival. His grandmother Tulasi forgave that; his father did not.

In 1619 news arrived that Harisankarī had died at twenty-three in her husband’s village. The women of Surada beat their chests and smeared dust on their hair, and Tulasi added an extra lamp at the household shrine. Ramachandra sat near the doorway and listened, silent for a long time, then walked out and stayed by the cattle shed until dark. After that he grew quick-tempered when someone spoke of sickness.

Tulasi died in 1622. Before the year was done, Gadadhar arranged Ramachandra’s marriage to Kanchanī, a young woman from another cultivating family in the area. The wedding brought drums, turmeric paste, and a small procession. Kanchanī moved into the compound and learned which pots were Mahadev’s wife Sona’s and which were hers. Ramachandra liked the bustle of marriage rituals and the teasing from his friends; he liked Kanchanī’s sharp replies. He also fought with her early. If she criticized him in front of Sona, he snapped back, then stormed out to the village edge.

By 1624 their son Damodar was born. Ramachandra carried the baby once, proud, then grew impatient with the crying and handed him back. He worked hard in bursts. One morning he would rise before dawn, wash at the tank, and drive the oxen straight and steady; another morning he would sleep late and stumble out with his hair uncombed. He started drinking more often after market days. Toddy and rice beer were easy to find when men gathered to trade grain, hire labor, or listen to a singer. He took pleasure in the warm sting, in talk that sped up, in laughter that came easy. He liked sitting with Bairagi Das, a traveling storyteller who sang devotional songs and also told obscene jokes when older women were out of earshot.

Padmā, his mother, died in 1628. She had grown worn from years of loss and work, and Ramachandra wept openly at her funeral, then refused to speak of her for months.

A daughter, Nilambarī, arrived in 1631. Kanchanī kept to her work—grinding grain, tending the hearth, and helping in the fields when needed—while Ramachandra bounced between obligations and distractions. Mahadev watched him more closely. When Ramachandra forgot to mend a broken latch on the grain store, Mahadev fixed it without a word, then later scolded him in front of the laborers. Ramachandra answered with a cutting remark and earned a shove. They did not reconcile with embraces. They shared work the next day.

Gadadhar died in 1635, and with him went the one man Ramachandra still tried to impress. Mahadev’s authority hardened. Headmen and revenue intermediaries pressed more insistently for dues and service days as the decade wore on; Panchu Nayak, the village man who dealt with those demands, came to courtyards with measuring sticks and a ledger held by someone else. Ramachandra argued over measures, then went to drink afterward, telling Bairagi Das that Panchu cheated on the grain count.

In 1635 Ramachandra fell seriously ill. A fever flattened him for weeks. He lay sweating on a mat near the hearth while Kanchanī fed him thin rice water and Sona complained about the extra work. Rukmini, the midwife and ritual healer, came with neem leaves and a bitter decoction. Tulasi’s old amulets were tied on again. When he could stand, he went straight to the toddy pot, swearing it would “settle his stomach,” and Kanchanī slapped his shoulder in anger. He grabbed her wrist and twisted hard enough to leave bruises. Mahadev pulled him off and struck him in the face once, in full view of the courtyard. Ramachandra spat blood and laughed, then sobbed in rage.

After harvest in 1638 the household opened the gola to measure paddy for dues and for a small trade, and the pile sat lower than it should have. Mahadev counted again. Sona accused Kalia, a seasonal laborer who had worked near the store. Ramachandra accused a neighboring hamlet, naming men he disliked. They searched, shouted, and threatened. Panchu Nayak advised quiet and compensation instead of a feud, then demanded his share anyway. Ramachandra wanted to beat someone immediately; Mahadev forced him to stand down. For months Ramachandra watched the paths near the fields at night, spear in hand, drunk and twitchy, seeing enemies in every shadow.

A fight in 1630 had already set his pattern. At a fair he drank too much and struck a man over a credit dispute, knocking him down and kicking him while others pulled him away. Later, at forty-one in 1642, violence came back on him. After drinking at a market evening he argued with Nanda Behera over an irrigation path. Nanda’s cousins joined in. Ramachandra swung first and was beaten to the ground with sticks. He returned to the compound with his back striped and his lip split, furious and humiliated. Mahadev went to elders to settle it with payments and promises. Ramachandra tried to reopen the quarrel for weeks, then drank more when no one followed him.

Damodar grew into a strong young man and began taking over day-to-day decisions. He spoke to his father in a flat tone that cut deeper than shouting. Nilambarī worked with Kanchanī and Sona, and she prayed at the village goddess shrine with careful seriousness, tying red thread and carrying leaf-cups of rice, salt, and flowers. Ramachandra teased her, then brought her small treats—fried sweets from the market, a piece of jaggery—when his guilt rose.

In 1650 the fever season was severe. People in Surada complained of weakness and chills; work crews thinned. Nilambarī fell ill first and did not recover. Damodar sickened soon after. Ramachandra sat near their mats, pouring water into their mouths, then running out to fetch Rukmini, then shouting at a neighbor who stepped too close. He stopped drinking for a short stretch, jittery and angry, then started again when fear made him restless.

Ramachandra caught the same acute fever and died on October 17, 1650, in the compound where he had been born. His body was washed, smeared with oil, and carried out by relatives; offerings of rice and a small lamp were set with him as the household completed the rites and disposed of the body according to local custom near the water.
