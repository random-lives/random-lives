The boy had no recorded name. He was born on December 22, 1294, in the upland villages north of present-day Zhangjiajie, under the Yuan dynasty’s county offices and tax quotas. His family spoke Chinese at home and dealt in the market speech used by travelers and officials who came through on errands for the state. The household was a patrilocal compound: his father lived under his own father’s roof, sharing stores of grain and tools.

His father, Li Shun, worked small plots carved from slopes and valley edges. Winter work meant repairing terrace walls, splitting firewood, and carrying loads along the mountain paths to a market town. His mother, Zhang Shi, kept the hearth, fed pigs and chickens, and turned beans and millet into meals. She also joined the women at the stream to wash cloth and rinse vegetables, then returned to tend the kitchen garden.

On the evening of the birth, the women of the household heated water, laid out cloth, and burned incense at the household shrine. In the morning, Li Shun’s mother set a bowl of food before the ancestors and spoke their names. The infant cried, took milk, and slept close to the brazier.

On December 26, a neighbor’s child stumbled near the hearth and knocked the brazier. Coals scattered onto the bedding. The infant was burned. He died the next day, December 27, 1294.
