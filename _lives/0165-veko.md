#       death but later carries stories of his trade literacy and generosity.
#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 30
#     connection: Occurs during peak trade activity; undermines trust in Russian trade
#       partners and forces Veko to tighten record-keeping and cache-guarding, increasing
#       workload and tension at home.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 34
#     connection: Prolonged winter-spring caregiving overlaps with reduced hunting range;
#       contributes to later economic pressure and fatigue, and sets a pattern of Veko
#       prioritizing kin needs over personal rest.
#     incident: sick_relative
#   - age: 38
#     connection: Builds on earlier caregiving; becomes central to household organization,
#       with Nyanya doing daily care while Veko compensates by increasing provisioning
#       and coordinating help from siblings.
#     incident: elderly_parents
#   - age: 22
#     connection: Civil War-era instability disrupts trade and travel early in marriage;
#       provides background for later suspicion of authorities/outsiders and motivates
#       maintaining mobility within the Ob–Irtysh district.
#     incident: warfare_impact (confirmed category)
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6 (1897-1903)
#     key_events:
#     - Born after an older brother’s death; household increases infant protections
#       (taboos, offerings at camp sites).
#     - 'First learning: following adults on short foraging trips, hearing Russian words
#       from visiting traders.'
#     - Family experiences repeated infant loss (1901, 1902-03), shaping Veko’s sensitivity
#       to provisioning and safety.
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 7-20 (1904-1917)
#     key_events:
#     - Begins serious hunting/fishing tasks; father entrusts him with routes and trapline
#       discipline.
#     - Learns basic Russian letters/numeracy through trade contacts (recording small
#       counts, names, debts).
#     - Sister Mando dies at 16 (1920) slightly after this phase; during late teens
#       the family anticipates her adulthood and relies on her labor.
#     phase: Later childhood & adolescence
#   - age_range: 21-32 (1918-1929)
#     key_events:
#     - Marriage to Nyanya (1918) and first children (1919, 1921, 1924); Veko grows
#       into leadership as organizer and negotiator.
#     - 'Warfare impact period: Civil War-era insecurity/requisitions affects travel
#       routes and trade dealings (roughly 1919-1922).'
#     - Child Miko dies at age 6 (1927), a major family grief event.
#     phase: Early adulthood & family formation
#   - age_range: 33-38 (1930-1935)
#     key_events:
#     - Prolonged caregiving for a close adult relative with wasting illness during
#       winter-spring (1930-1932).
#     - Balances trade obligations with increasingly complex kin needs; relies on wife
#       and older daughter for camp stability.
#     - Younger daughter Nyeko is born (1931), increasing dependents during an already
#       demanding period.
#     phase: Peak responsibility & strain
#   - age_range: 39-41 (1936-1939)
#     key_events:
#     - Eldercare intensifies as parents become less mobile; household keeps them attached
#       much of the year (1933-1939, peaking 1936-1939).
#     - Father dies (1937) and mother dies (1938), compressing grief, obligations, and
#       identity loss.
#     - Suicide in October 1939 after cumulative strain and a sense of failure/control
#       loss, despite outward prominence.
#     phase: Late adulthood (final years)

#     death_age: 72

#     name: Kardo
#     narrative_role: Much younger brother; looks up to Veko as a model hunter and ‘Russian-letter’
#       man. Too young to fully share Veko’s early burdens but old enough to remember
#       his decline.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds reputation as steady and fair, but also leads to overcommitment
#       and difficulty refusing others’ demands.
#     scene: Veko mediates a dispute over a shared fishing spot and insists on a compromise
#       that prevents retaliation; later he absorbs extra work so a grieving sibling
#       can rest.
#     timing: Young adulthood through late adulthood (1918-1939)
#     trait: High Agreeableness (86th)
#   - consequence: Maintains long-term trust with most partners, but can be exploited
#       by the unscrupulous and feels moral injury when cheated.
#     scene: After discovering the pelt substitution theft, he refuses to retaliate
#       by cheating another trader and instead documents counts carefully and confronts
#       the issue directly but calmly.
#     timing: Age ~30 (1926-1928) and after
#     trait: High Honesty-Humility (85th)
#   - consequence: Others rely on him; however, distress may be delayed/suppressed,
#       contributing to a sudden collapse near the end of life.
#     scene: During dangerous winter travel and during the sick-relative period, he
#       stays outwardly calm, focuses on tasks, and reassures others rather than catastrophizing.
#     timing: Especially visible in peak responsibility years (1930-1935)
#     trait: Low Neuroticism (34th)
#   - consequence: Enhances trade success and prominence; increases exposure to conflict,
#       theft, and political scrutiny during unstable years.
#     scene: He willingly initiates conversations at trading posts, remembers names,
#       and maintains a broad network across camps and settlements.
#     timing: Adolescence onward; strongest in early adulthood (1914-1929)
#     trait: Above-average Extraversion (63rd)
#   - consequence: Facilitates leadership in hunting parties; marriage stability driven
#       more by practicality/kin ties than romantic display.
#     scene: He is physically capable and imposing in negotiations and travel labor;
#       not especially sought for looks, but respected for competence and steadiness.
#     timing: Adulthood
#     trait: High physical stature (87th height percentile) with modest attractiveness
#       (34th)
#   - consequence: Occasional vulnerability to fraud/administrative pressure; compensates
#       with careful routines and social trust.
#     scene: He can write basic Russian notes and counts but struggles with more complex
#       contracts/official demands; he relies on trusted bilingual contacts for tricky
#       paperwork.
#     timing: Trade-heavy years (1920s-1930s)
#     trait: Lower measured intelligence (29th) expressed as limited formal abstraction,
#       but functional practical skill
#   - consequence: Provides companionship; also creates a private compartment of life,
#       increasing isolation if shame or gossip risk rises.
#     scene: He shows a pattern of close, emotionally intense male friendships during
#       travel seasons; any sexual non-normativity remains offstage and hidden, never
#       displacing his marriage.
#     timing: Late adolescence through early adulthood (1915-1925)
#     trait: Bisexual orientation expressed discreetly under strong marriage norms
#   - consequence: Sudden rupture for the household; siblings and wife must reconfigure
#       leadership and trade ties.
#     scene: After parents’ deaths and sustained caregiving burden, he becomes quieter,
#       sleeps poorly, and withdraws from shared joking; one night he leaves camp alone
#       and does not return.
#     timing: Final year (1938-1939)
#     trait: No clear mental disorder, but end-of-life acute crisis leading to suicide
# number_of_children: '5'
# number_of_siblings: '9'
# occupation: Lead hunter/trapline organizer + trade intermediary (coordinates exchange
#   with Russian posts; reads/writes basic records)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: While trading furs and supplies at a Russian river settlement on the Ob–Irtysh
#     route, he discovered that a visiting trader/boatman had taken part of his bundled
#     sable/fox pelts from a shared cache and substituted lower-value skins, leaving
#     him short on goods owed for the season.
#   reasoning: As a trade intermediary with goods (furs, tools, food stores), he had
#     more to steal than most and interacted with wider networks where theft/cheating
#     could occur.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Age 29–31 (1926–1928)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: He spent a winter and spring repeatedly moving camp more slowly and staying
#     near reliable fishing places to care for a close adult relative with a wasting
#     cough and weakness (likely tuberculosis), feeding them, keeping the fire, and
#     arranging occasional contact with a settlement healer/trader for medicines.
#   reasoning: In an extended taiga household with limited medical care, serious illness/injury
#     often required months of feeding, transport, and daily help from able adults;
#     his high agreeableness makes him likely to take on such duties.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 33–35 (1930–1932)
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: As his parents became less able to travel and work, his household kept them
#     in the camp unit for much of the year; he provided food shares from his trapline
#     and organized transport by boat/sledge, with his wife handling daily care while
#     he ensured their needs were met.
#   reasoning: His parents likely had many children, which can spread eldercare, but
#     living in an extended household and his stable prominence increases the chance
#     an aging parent/in-law resided with him and relied on him materially.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 36–41 (1933–1939)
#   type: elderly_parents

Veko was born on November 16, 1897, in the West Siberian taiga north of the Ob River settlements, in country ruled from St. Petersburg and administered through Russian officials and traders. His family were Forest Nenets. In camp they spoke Nenets, but the river brought Russian words, Russian goods, and Russian rules. In the household, offerings went to local place-spirits and to the spirits tied to hunting luck: fat set on a small wooden figure, a strip of cloth tied at a known tree, tobacco pinched out on the snow before a hard trip.

He entered the world after loss. His older brother Yarko had died the year before, still small enough to ride against a mother’s chest. When Veko was a baby his mother, Lempo, kept careful about what crossed the sleeping place and what was said over an infant. His father Haryo, a tall man who ran traplines and bargained hard at posts, did not leave his wife alone at night in the first weeks. He took the long watch, listening for dogs and strangers.

The household grew fast and then shrank. A sister, Savo, was born in 1901 and died the same day. Another brother, Toko, came in 1902 and was gone before he could walk. Veko remembered those deaths through objects, not stories: the way his mother stored infant things out of sight, the silence when a woman began the birth songs and then stopped. He learned early to accept a plan and carry it out without asking for more explanation than a parent gave.

He was big for his age and stayed that way. By the time he was eight he could lift a pail of fish with one hand and walk without stumbling, and the adults began to send him on short errands along the riverbank. Haryo took him to check deadfalls and to reset snares where the willow thickets held hare. He corrected Veko’s knots until they held, then stopped correcting and watched. Veko had a routine even as a boy: touch the line, count what needed counting, then sit and eat before starting again. When he was sent to a Russian shack to trade fish for shot, he listened more than he spoke, then repeated the phrases to himself on the walk back.

Lempo’s work filled the days: cutting fish for drying, turning hides, sewing boots and mittens, keeping children clean enough not to blister, and keeping the small sacred things away from careless hands. Veko learned which bags not to open and which poles not to step over. Before the first long winter trip each year, Lempo placed a dab of fat onto a small spirit-figure kept wrapped in cloth, and she told Veko to speak quietly when he passed it. He obeyed without complaint.

Mando, his sister born in 1904, became the extra set of hands that made the family run smoothly. She could dress a pike quickly and make a fire in wind. Veko liked her jokes; she teased him about his careful counting and called him “letter-man” when he practiced Russian on scraps of paper. Peko was born in 1906 and died as a toddler in 1908. After that, Tyaro arrived in 1909 and stayed. When Veko was twelve he carried Tyaro on his back while Lempo worked, and he learned how to calm a child without shouting. He hated shouting in camp. It made dogs restless. Nado, another brother, was born in 1912 and died before he could crawl.

By his mid-teens, Haryo was taking him to trade more often. Veko learned to write basic Russian letters from a settlement clerk called Pavel the Scribe, who liked tobacco and liked to feel useful. Veko learned to copy names, make simple lists, and write numbers. His hand stayed plain and blocky. He could read short notes and labels. Long printed text made him tired quickly; he followed the lines with a finger and lost his place. He did not pretend otherwise. When he didn’t understand, he asked Pavel to read it aloud and repeat the parts that mattered.

Kardo, the youngest brother, was born in 1915 and clung to Veko when he was small. Veko brought him pieces of dried fish and small carved scraps from antler. He did not play rough games with him; he showed him how to sit still and listen for birds.

Marriage came when Veko was twenty. In 1918 he took Nyanya as his wife. She was quick with her hands and did not waste words. They set up their own camp space but stayed close to Haryo and Lempo’s territory. Their first child, Sera, arrived in 1919. Veko marked the birth with an offering of fat and a small piece of cloth at a known tree near their winter route, then went back to checking gear.

The years of civil fighting and shifting power reached even the taiga. In 1919 armed men traveled the rivers, demanding food and transport. Once, on a trip toward a settlement, a man named Daniil stopped Veko’s boat and made him open his bundles. Veko kept his face calm and answered in Russian as well as he could, holding his hands open and still. He gave up a sack of flour and two small metal tools rather than argue. At home he did not boast about it. He checked the family’s stored goods twice that winter and moved some items to a second cache.

A son, Miko, was born in 1921. Another son, Tadyo, came in 1924. Veko worked harder each season. His height and strength mattered on portages and in deep snow, but his advantage came from planning: he organized who went where, which traps were checked first, which fish sites were left to rest. He enjoyed tea sweetened with sugar bought at the post, and he liked to sit in the early evening with a cup while Nyanya sewed and Sera braided cord. He laughed easily with his brother Nyarko, born in 1899, especially when Nyarko mocked the way Russian traders tried to imitate Nenets words.

In 1920 Mando died at sixteen. A sickness took her quickly after a winter trip. The camp work tightened. Lempo carried more, then Nyanya did. Veko spoke to the shaman Khasava and followed the instructions given: a small offering, a day of restraint, certain words not spoken. He also did the practical things—boiled water longer, kept the children closer to the fire, watched for coughs.

In 1927 Miko died at six. The boy had been running along the river edge and went under the ice in early spring. Veko pulled him out, but the child never warmed enough to live. After that, Veko became strict about ice. He tested it with a pole before letting anyone step forward. He barked once at Tadyo for running, then stopped and spoke in a low voice instead, making the boy repeat the rule back to him.

The theft happened in 1927 at a river settlement on the Ob–Irtysh route. Veko had stacked a bundle of sable and fox pelts in a shared cache near a shed, wrapped and tied the way he always did. After a night of drinking and talk among boatmen, he opened the bundle and found low-value skins tucked in where the best pelts had been. He did not strike anyone. He went straight to Stepan Kireev, a trader he had dealt with before, set the skins on the table, and counted out loud in Russian. He wrote the numbers on paper and made Stepan look. The argument stayed tight and controlled. Veko left with less than he was owed, but he changed how he worked: he kept his own cache, he wrote lists, and he stopped trusting casual promises.

Yando was born in 1928 and died at birth. Nyanya returned to work with a stiff face and kept the infant things folded and tied. Veko spent more time out on the trapline that winter, coming back with meat and furs and little conversation.

In the winter of 1930, Old Neko—his mother’s uncle, attached to their camp—began to cough. The cough deepened, and he lost strength. Veko slowed the household’s travel and kept them near reliable fishing places through spring 1931, hauling water, feeding the sick man broth and fish, and keeping the fire steady through the night. He traveled to a settlement for medicine and brought back small packets and a bottle from Yevdokiya, who told him to keep the sick man warm and away from smoke. Veko followed orders carefully. Old Neko died in 1931 anyway.

Nyeko, Veko’s second daughter, was born later in 1931. Sera took on more work without being asked. Tadyo began to carry loads and set simple traps. Veko spoke to his children gently when he had time, then returned to planning routes. He disliked pointless talk with traders and avoided drunk men.

From 1933 onward, Haryo and Lempo grew old in the practical way that mattered in the taiga: they could not travel far, and their hands tired fast. Veko kept them in the extended household camp unit. Nyanya handled daily care—food, warmth, cleaning, small sores—while Veko provided. He assigned Nyarko the nearer lines and took the harder routes himself. In 1937 Haryo died after a winter of weakness. Lempo followed in 1938. Veko arranged their camp rites with Khasava: food set out, a strip of cloth tied at a familiar place, tobacco offered. He did the work without ceremony.

After that, Veko’s voice grew quieter. He still went out, still wrote his short lists, still negotiated at posts, but he stopped laughing with Nyarko. He slept in broken stretches, getting up to check the dogs and then sitting alone with cold tea. Sera watched him and said little.

On October 22, 1939, Veko walked away from camp before dawn and did not take his gun for hunting. He went to a known stand of trees near an old route and hanged himself with a line. Nyarko and Nyanya cut him down and carried him to a sheltered place. They laid him out and left offerings of tobacco and a small piece of fat, then marked the spot so the household could avoid stepping across it in the dark.
