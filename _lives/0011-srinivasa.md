Srinivasa was born on October 26, 1516, in Kanchipuram, in a street that stirred before dawn when pilgrims passed on their way to the Vishnu temples. In his house people spoke Telugu. Their neighbors spoke Tamil. His grandmother kept the children close to the household’s ways and corrected them when they slipped into the wrong words.

Three generations lived under one roof. His paternal grandfather slept near the front, where he could hear the street and the vendor calls. Srinivasa’s father left before the heat built, carrying sacks on a shoulder pole. He walked out beyond the town to the family’s small leased fields and returned to the market lanes to weigh and sell grain. A clerk kept the figures on palm leaf; his father listened and nodded, then asked his mother to count the coins again at home.

His mother’s days stayed inside the yard and at the tank: water, firewood, grinding, washing, and keeping children from the cooking fire. Srinivasa was the third child. An older brother and sister lived, and three younger siblings did not live past infancy. Later, the sister who had been older than him died at ten, and the brother at sixteen. Those deaths were spoken of plainly and folded into the work of each day.

On festival days she took Srinivasa to the Vishnu temple and held him in the crush at the entry. Bells rang. Camphor smoke hung in the air. He pressed his hand to the stone at the threshold and turned his face into her shoulder when the shouting rose.

In the monsoon months of 1519, fever and cough moved through the lanes. Srinivasa sickened after two days of runny nose and heat in his skin. The cough deepened and his breathing turned fast and pulling. He stopped nursing. His mother kept him against her, tried spooning thin rice water into his mouth, and listened to the rattle in his chest.

He died before sunrise on August 18, 1519, on the floor of the main room. The street outside was wet and quiet, and his mother stayed sitting with him until the first calls began again.
