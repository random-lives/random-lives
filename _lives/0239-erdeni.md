#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: 1652
#     name: Hūwangga
#     narrative_role: Mixed hunter-fisher-cultivator; taught Erdeni careful tool care,

#   - death_year: 1648
#     name: Aisin
#     narrative_role: Household manager with heavy gathering/gardening duties; model
#       of endurance and routine. Warm but demanding; her illness/death contributes
#       to the sustained religious intensification later and deepens Erdeni’s depressive
#       symptoms.
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: 1614
#     name: Ama (unnamed paternal grandmother)
#     narrative_role: Present in earliest memories; taught early household taboos and

#     death_year: 1633
#     name: Ejen
#     narrative_role: Only live-born child; dies shortly after birth during a cold-season
#       illness wave. Her death becomes a quiet, recurring grief for both parents and
#       later shapes Erdeni’s turn toward more intensive protective rites.
#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 28
#     connection: Begins after the infant’s death and several poor seasons; he rationalizes
#       trespass as necessity and as compensation for perceived unfair access to productive
#       forest.
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   - age: 34
#     connection: Stops or reduces after conflict costs rise and after being beaten
#       in a dispute, making him more cautious and more reliant on close-to-home subsistence.
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime (continuation)
#   - age: 31
#     connection: Occurs amid accusations of trespass; alcohol and public shame trigger
#       a rare loss of restraint, creating a feud-like tension with neighboring men.
#     incident: physical_assault_perp
#   - age: 33
#     connection: Retaliatory or related to ongoing net/trap disputes and suspicion
#       from other settlement; reinforces his later religious intensification and desire
#       for protective rites.
#     incident: physical_assault (victim)
#   - age: 39
#     connection: Triggered by household sickness and bad hunting plus accumulated grief;
#       he seeks stronger shaman-led protections and adopts new taboos about places,
#       tools, and offerings.
#     incident: religious_change
#   - age: 42
#     connection: 'Practices stabilize into a new routine: more frequent offerings,
#       amulets on hunting gear, and stricter observance of prohibitions tied to a territorial
#       spirit.'
#     incident: religious_change (peak/settling)
#   - age: 44
#     connection: Lingering cough/fevers reshape his work role and increase dependence
#       on wife/brother for long-distance provisioning; also deepens depressive symptoms
#       in winters.
#     incident: chronic_illness
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-7 (1606-1613)
#     key_events:
#     - 'Learns household and riverbank routines: gathering kindling, tending small
#       garden plots, watching fish drying racks.'

#     key_events:
#     - Growing political consolidation under Later Jin felt as new obligations/visits
#       by local leaders; men discuss service and tribute in furs.
#     - Learns winter travel discipline and tool maintenance; becomes known as careful
#       and steady rather than daring.
#     - Forms adult-brother dynamic with younger brother Mergen (teaching mixed with
#       competition).
#     phase: Later childhood & adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-27 (1624-1633)
#     key_events:
#     - Older sister Bujantai dies at 23 (1627), triggering prolonged mourning and the

#     - 'Violence cluster: he commits a serious assault at a midwinter gathering (1637)
#       and is later assaulted returning from fishing camp (1639).'
#     - Mother Aisin dies (1648); household shifts toward elder-support and prompts
#       intensified ritual attention and protective taboos (begins 1645–1648, peaks
#       1645–1648/1649).

#       (shared work) with rivalry over hunting grounds and reputation after Erdeni’s
#       midlife conflicts.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Others trust him in practical emergencies; he is sought for steady
#       hands, even by men who dislike him during resource disputes.
#     scene: During sudden river-ice break or a near-drowning incident in the fishing
#       season, he responds with calm, methodical actions—cutting a line, directing
#       others, then returning to work without visible panic.
#     timing: adolescence and recurring adulthood scenes (c. ages 15–40)
#     trait: Very low neuroticism (1st percentile)
#   - consequence: Household usually avoids catastrophic shortages; however, his strictness
#       contributes to tension with peers who see him as judgmental or controlling.
#     scene: He keeps traps, net weights, and knives meticulously maintained; he inventories
#       dried fish/meat and repairs winter clothing early, pushing household routines
#       even when others want to postpone.
#     timing: from late childhood onward (ages 10+)
#     trait: High conscientiousness (76th percentile)
#   - consequence: Stability in normal years, but during lean years he adapts slowly—helping
#       set the stage for desperate choices like trespass trapping.
#     scene: He is skeptical of unfamiliar techniques or distant customs; he prefers
#       established seasonal routes and resists experimenting with new exchange partners
#       until forced by scarcity.
#     timing: young adulthood to midlife (ages 20–40)
#     trait: Low openness (23rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Strains marriage, reduces social visiting and cooperative exchanges,
#       and makes him more prone to rigid thinking and resentful interpretations during
#       disputes.
#     scene: After sister’s death and later after the infant’s death, he shows weeks-to-months
#       of early waking, slowed movement, loss of appetite, and withdrawing from conversation;
#       he still performs essential tasks but without pleasure, especially in long winters.
#     timing: first clear onset ages 21–22 (1627–1628), recurrence and worsening in
#       midlife and with chronic illness (1633 onward; notable winters in 1640s and
#       1650s)
#     trait: Depressive disorder (persistent/episodic)
# number_of_children: '1'
# number_of_siblings: '3'
# occupation: 'Mixed subsistence provider: hunting/trapping + fishing + some cultivation
#   (seasonal round)'
# religion: Clan/household ancestor offerings + shamanic rituals for illness/fortune
#   + local nature/territorial spirit offerings

# structured_incidents:
# - event: 'Recurring pattern: during several lean winters he set traps and took sable/marten
#     in a stretch of forest customarily used by a neighboring clan group, sometimes
#     removing other men’s trap stakes and quietly selling pelts through intermediaries
#     at a riverside exchange.'
#   reasoning: Activities like poaching on others’ hunting grounds, illicit trade, or
#     opportunistic taking were not uncommon and were sometimes norm-blurred; still,
#     as an ordinary, locally rooted man, repeated serious property offending is not
#     the default.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 28–34
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime
# - event: 'Sustained period: after a severe sickness in the household and a run of
#     bad hunting, he shifted from routine ancestor offerings to more intensive shaman-led
#     rites and adopted new protective taboos and amulets linked to a particular territorial
#     spirit said to control game and illness, changing how the family made seasonal
#     offerings.'
#   reasoning: Household ancestor/shamanic practice was customary and stable; significant
#     conversion (e.g., to Buddhism/Chinese religion) was possible via contact but not
#     common for a locally rooted commoner.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 39–42
#   type: religious_change
# - event: 'Single event: returning from a winter fishing camp, he was beaten by several
#     men from another settlement after an argument over whose nets had been cut and
#     whose catch had been taken; he was left with bruised ribs and a swollen face but
#     survived.'
#   reasoning: Frontier life with feuds, raiding, alcohol-fueled fights, and disputes
#     over resources makes at least one serious non-domestic assault a common pathway
#     to 'victim of violence' for an adult man.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 33
#   type: physical_assault
# - event: 'Single event: in a drunken dispute at a midwinter gathering over accusations
#     of trespass on hunting grounds, he struck a man with a wooden pole and then grappled
#     him to the ground, leaving the other man bloodied and unable to hunt for a time.'
#   reasoning: Non-lethal violence in disputes, retaliation, or brawls was relatively
#     common and is the most likely form of perpetration for a rural man, even with
#     decent conscientiousness.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 31
#   type: physical_assault_perp
# - event: 'Sustained period: from his mid-40s he developed a lingering cough with periodic
#     fever and exhaustion that worsened each cold season, limiting long hunts and forcing
#     him to rely more on short-range fishing and household tasks between flare-ups.'
#   reasoning: Chronic respiratory disease (including post-infectious problems), arthritis,
#     and lingering effects of infections were common by middle age, though not universal.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 44–51
#   type: chronic_illness

Erdeni was born in the spring of 1606 in the mixed forests and river country of the Sanjiang Plain, in a small Jurchen community that spoke a Jurchenic tongue and lived by hunting, fishing, and garden plots. During his childhood, Nurhaci's Later Jin drew clans into new obligations; men talked about tribute in furs and service, and strangers began to arrive with messages and demands.

His parents, Hūwangga and Aisin, kept a tidy household. Aisin dried fish on racks set high enough to keep dogs from stealing it, and she planted beans and millet in a patch cut from the trees. Hūwangga spent long days walking trap lines and checking weirs, returning with damp boots and a bundle of sticks for net repair. Erdeni grew up between those rhythms. He learned early where tools belonged and how to keep them from rusting: knife oiled, fishhook wrapped, sinew thread stored in a sealed pouch so mice could not chew it. His mother scolded him if he left anything on the ground. He stopped doing that.

Two older sisters came before him. The first, Sargan, died before he could remember her; Aisin kept a small bundle of cloth from the baby’s swaddling and brought it out when the household made offerings. The second sister, Bujantai, was born in 1604 and stayed long enough to be part of his days. She carried him when he was small, tied to her back while she gathered mushrooms and the inner bark for cord. When he was six she teased him for counting fish one by one on the rack, touching each with a finger to make sure the count was right, and she invented songs with numbers that made him laugh and keep counting.

A paternal grandmother lived with them at the start of his life. She taught him the small gestures: a pinch of flour scattered by the threshold, a bit of fat tossed into the fire for the household spirits, and a short spoken line before a hunt. When she died in 1614, Erdeni helped carry water and firewood for the wake. The adults spoke in low voices about the cold and the cough that had taken her. Aisin washed the body and tied the hair back. Hūwangga set out a bowl of broth and a strip of dried meat near the place where his mother had slept.

Erdeni’s younger brother, Mergen, arrived in 1609. Erdeni treated him as an apprentice once they were both old enough to be useful. In winter he showed Mergen how to read snow around a trap, how to see if a fox had circled it, how to handle the dead animal so blood did not stain the fur. Mergen learned fast and began to argue about routes and timing. They fought with words more than hands, and their parents left them to it unless it turned into shouting.

As the 1610s ended, messengers and armed men moved more often along the river corridors. Hūwangga attended meetings with other household heads, returning irritated by orders he did not choose. Erdeni listened and said little. When danger pressed close—rumors of raiders, a boat spotted downstream—he did not run about or ask questions. He checked the lashings on the sled, packed the dried fish into hide bags, and waited for instructions.

Bujantai married into another nearby settlement and visited when she could, bringing news and small items: a needle made of better metal, a bit of salt wrapped in bark. She died in 1627 at twenty-three, after a short illness that left her weak and sweating. Erdeni helped carry a pole for her bier. After the burial he stopped joining evening talk. He still rose early, still checked traps, still worked the net weights smooth with a stone, but he ate little and stared into the fire without moving. Aisin pressed him to speak to the household spirits and to his sister’s shade. He did the motions without argument, but the slowness and the silence did not lift.

Marriage came the next year. In 1628 he took Alun as his wife. She was quick with her hands and blunt with her mouth. She matched him in work, and they settled into an arrangement without much ceremony beyond what the elders required: gifts exchanged, a feast, and formal words before the ancestors. Erdeni built a small hearth space close to his parents’ place, close enough that Aisin could call out across the yard when she needed help lifting a pot or carrying wood.

In the winter of 1633 their daughter, Ejen, was born. The child lived only a short time. A cold-sickness moved through several households that season; coughing and diarrhea took infants first. Alun’s milk dried. The baby’s skin turned grey and cool. Afterward, Alun returned to work quickly, carrying water and splitting fish, but her face stayed hard and her voice sharp. Erdeni stayed quiet for long stretches. He did not seek people out. He avoided gatherings unless required, and when he did attend he sat near the edge and watched hands rather than faces.

Lean winters followed. The 1630s brought hard cold and thin yields from the gardens. Game shifted, and men argued more about whose forest and whose river bend held the better spots. Some hunters tried new routes or traded with unfamiliar middlemen from farther south, but Erdeni kept to the paths his father had shown him. He trusted what he knew. When Mergen suggested a different approach to the winter camps, Erdeni refused. Only when the old ways failed entirely did he begin crossing lines that he understood well. Starting in 1634 he set traps for sable and marten in a stretch of forest used by a neighboring clan group. He pulled up other men’s trap stakes and reset them farther off. When he carried the pelts to exchange, he used Sonde, a riverside intermediary who asked no questions and took a cut. Erdeni kept his own hands clean at the meeting places, staying quiet while Sonde spoke.

That choice fed the household, but it also sharpened suspicion. At a midwinter gathering in 1637, with drink passed around and accusations spoken loudly, Yanggū from the neighboring settlement called him a thief and said his traps stole from other men’s children. Erdeni had been silent through the first words. When Yanggū repeated the charge, Erdeni stood, took up a wooden pole used for carrying loads, and struck him across the shoulder and head. Yanggū went down. Erdeni grappled him and pinned him until others pulled them apart. Blood ran from Yanggū’s scalp onto the snow. An uncle, Hūlun, demanded compensation. Erdeni paid in pelts and dried fish, and he stayed away from the next two gatherings.

Two years later, returning from a winter fishing camp in 1639, he was met on a path by several men from another settlement. They accused him of cutting nets and stealing catch. They knocked him down and kicked him, bruising his ribs and swelling his face. He walked home bent forward, breathing shallow, and sat by the fire without speaking while Alun dabbed snowmelt water on the bruises. In the days that followed, he moved with care. He still checked traps. He still set the net line. He spoke less than before.

The 1640s brought news from far away: Ming walls broken, new rulers in the south, trade routes shifting. In their river country, the change arrived as different buyers, different demands, and men with authority who claimed to speak for the new order. Fur and ginseng moved out more steadily. Men argued more often about who could trap where.

In 1645 a sickness hit their household. Aisin developed fever and a deep cough. At the same time the hunting was poor, and a spring flood spoiled stored fish. Erdeni turned away from the small routine offerings that had been enough in earlier years. He brought in Nisihūn, a shaman, and paid him with pelts and cloth. Nisihūn sang and shook a drum, called the household ancestors by name, and spoke of a territorial spirit that owned the game trails. Under Nisihūn’s direction, Erdeni tied protective amulets—small bundles of fur and thread—onto his hunting gear. He stopped stepping over certain fallen logs and refused to cut wood in a patch of trees where Nisihūn said the spirit listened. He poured vodka-like spirits and broth onto the ground at set points in the season, and he made Alun keep a clean bowl reserved for offerings only. Those practices continued after Aisin died in 1648. The household marked her death with food offerings and careful handling of her tools; Alun kept Aisin’s best knife wrapped and stored, taken out only for rites.

Hūwangga aged quickly after his wife’s death. By 1650 Erdeni and Alun lived with him and, often, with Mergen as well. Erdeni took on the less glamorous tasks: repairing nets, re-cutting wooden floats, keeping the stored food counted and dry. He stopped taking the longest hunts. In 1650 he developed a cough that never left. Fever came with it, then exhaustion that returned every cold season. He still went out, but closer to home, setting short trap lines and working the river edge. When he needed to rest, he sat on a low bench by the doorway where he could see the racks and the yard and correct small mistakes without raising his voice.

Hūwangga died in 1652. Erdeni handled the household obligations with steady hands, directing the preparation and the offerings. Afterward he withdrew more. In winter he woke early, stared at the fire, and let the pot boil down unless Alun reminded him. Some days he moved slowly, finishing only the necessary work. Other days he worked hard and methodically until dark without speaking to anyone.

An acute illness struck in early summer of 1657. Erdeni’s cough turned wet and constant, and he grew hot and weak. Alun and Mergen kept him inside and fed him broth. On July 1, 1657, he died in the house where his parents had lived. His kin washed the body, dressed him, and laid him out with a small bowl of meat and a cup of spirits for the ancestors and the territorial spirit whose rules he had followed. They buried him on higher ground above the river, with his knife wrapped in cloth beside him.
