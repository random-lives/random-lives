Ruqayyah was born on a warm morning in early March of 1442 in the stony country north of al-Madinah, where the black lava broke into pockets of palms and shallow plots around Khaybar. The air in the room held dust and goat hair. Her mother washed her with water kept back in a skin and tied a small leather packet at the baby’s neck with a Qur’anic verse inside, protection against the eye. In that house there were only her parents and the work that never ended: kneading, sweeping, fetching, mending. Her father slept light because he rose before dawn to take other people’s animals out to graze.

A boy was born before her and another after, and both were gone within days. Their bodies were small enough to wrap and carry. Ruqayyah lived past the point when a child could vanish without warning. She stayed thin like most children there, but she moved fast and watched everything. She learned the drag of a full water skin against her hip and how to keep her head covered when the wind lifted grit off the ground. She spoke the Hijazi Arabic of her people, quick and clipped, full of names for wells, shrubs, and bad stretches of stone.

Her mother’s hands were always busy: straining milk, turning it to sour curds, rubbing wool clean between her palms, feeding the fire with dry thorn. Ruqayyah copied what she was shown and remembered the steps. She was careful with chores when her mother stood over her. When no one counted, she took things. A few dates from the bowl set aside for visitors. A length of thread from the spindle. Once, a small pinch of salt from the jar. She hid what she took and traded it with other children for odds and ends—an old copper bead, a strip of dyed cloth, a broken comb with teeth still left. When she was caught she lied without blinking, then turned offended, as if the accusation were the real injury. Her mother’s anger landed harder on the lying than on the missing dates.

Her father worked for men who owned animals and land. In the pilgrimage season the road brought more travelers and more animals moving through, and the sharif’s men showed up more often at the wells and on the track, collecting fees and pushing people to make room. The household never dealt with officials directly; they felt it through the men who hired her father. When business was good, the patron promised extra pay. When the season ended, he delayed it. Sometimes Ruqayyah’s father came home with grain instead of coin. Sometimes he came home with nothing but a claim that he would be paid later.

From the time Ruqayyah was five the rains failed more than once. Each bad year made the next one harder. Pasture thinned until even the tough shrubs were chewed down. Goats nosed at bare ground and fought over scraps. Milk in the house ran short. Her mother stretched meals—more flatbread, less fat—and watered the sour milk until it was thin. Ruqayyah felt the change in her father’s temper. He came back with dust stuck in his eyebrows and spoke in short bursts about animals dropping behind the herd and owners arguing over losses. He walked farther each week for grazing and slept heavy when he returned.

On market days prices jumped. Dates and grain cost more, and her mother sent Ruqayyah with a small basket to barter and watch the measures. Ruqayyah liked the crush of bodies and the noise. She pushed to the front, spoke over older women, and flashed quick smiles at men who were not her kin. When someone hesitated, she took the pause as permission. She came home with what her mother asked for more often than she should have, not because she was trusted but because she made herself hard to refuse. A neighbor slapped her hand once at a stall and told her to stop reaching like a thief.

One summer when Ruqayyah was ten, the closest well dropped low. People came earlier and waited longer. The line turned sharp, women accusing each other of stealing a place. Her mother sent Ruqayyah before sunrise with a skin and a clay jar, counting on her small body to slip through. Ruqayyah did, edging ahead of an older girl and pretending not to hear. The older girl grabbed the skin and jerked it away. Water splashed onto the dirt. Ruqayyah lifted her hand as if to strike back and only stopped when the older girl’s aunt stepped between them. She walked home with half the water and a red mark around her wrist, furious more at being stopped than at being hurt. That night her mother recited ruqyah over her, then over the water jar and the corner where they kept the food, the words steady in the dark.

In 1453 the heat held on late into the year. More people in the cluster of houses fell sick, first with headache and chills, then burning skin and weakness that pinned them to the mat. Ruqayyah went on an errand in the morning and came back complaining that the light hurt her eyes. By evening she shook with cold. The next day the fever climbed and stayed there. She snapped at her mother, then stopped speaking and stared at the wall.

Her mother pressed water to her lips and retied the little leather packet at her neck. Ruqayyah’s father sat near the doorway, silent, listening for her breathing. On September 30, 1453, before midday, Ruqayyah’s chest rose once and did not rise again. Her mother closed her mouth with two fingers. The room already had flies, and her father drove them off with a rag until it was time to carry the body out.
