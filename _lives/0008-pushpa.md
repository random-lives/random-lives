historical_notes:
  - "In 1936–37 Raebareli was in British-ruled North India (the United Provinces), where Congress-led nationalist politics often surfaced through meetings, rumors, and periodic arrests, even in farming districts."
  - "Small peasant proprietors in the Gangetic plains commonly relied on a mixed economy: small landholdings plus a few cattle or buffalo for milk sales, which provided steadier cash than seasonal crop income."
  - "A household “puja” shrine with a daily lamp, incense, water offerings, and brief prayers was a widespread form of home-based Hindu practice in North Indian villages, alongside festival observance and occasional temple visits."
  - "Before antibiotics were widely available in rural India, acute respiratory infections in infants were frequently fatal, and treatment often came from local “compounders” (informal or semi-trained practitioners) dispensing powders and home remedies rather than hospital care."

Pushpa was born on August 19, 1936, in a village outside Raebareli in the United Provinces. The land lay flat and open, with scattered trees at the edges and dirt tracks that stayed dry and powdery until the rains. Inside her parents’ house, Awadhi filled the rooms.

At daybreak her mother lit a small lamp at the household shrine and set down water in a metal lota before anyone ate. The rest of the morning went to the usual work—grain ground and cooked, pots scrubbed, clothes rinsed, younger children watched. Pushpa’s father farmed his own narrow plots and kept two milk animals. He cut fodder before the sun climbed, then carried a tin pail of milk to the lane, where a local buyer took it and noted the amount to settle later.

Pushpa was the fourth child. Two sisters and a brother were already in the house. Before her, a baby had died, and no one spoke about it, but her mother counted the children by habit when she fed them and when she laid them down.

In January the cold tightened at night. Pushpa started with a cough. Within days her breathing turned quick and shallow, each breath lifting her ribs. Her mother kept her close to the fire and rubbed warm oil over her chest and back. A compounder came once, felt for fever, left a paper twist of bitter powder, and took a few coins.

Pushpa did not improve. She died before dawn on February 7, 1937. In the shed behind the house, the buffalo shifted and stamped in the dark while the household woke to the quiet that followed.
