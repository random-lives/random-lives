historical_notes:
  - "Raebareli district (United Provinces, British India) in 1936–37 was administered under the colonial UP government framework; the place-name “United Provinces” is the correct contemporaneous jurisdiction for her birth and death."
  - "Language: Awadhi (Eastern Hindi) was a dominant home language in the Raebareli–Awadh belt; the 1931 Census of India for the United Provinces reported very large totals of “Hindi”/regional Hindi varieties, while official domains (schooling/administration) often favored standardized Hindi/Urdu and English—consistent with Awadhi being used inside the household."
  - "Demography/health: In interwar north India, infant and under‑5 mortality was extremely high by modern standards, and repeat infant loss within a sibling set was common; Pushpa’s death at ~5.5 months fits the period’s typical risk profile rather than an unusual event."
  - "Cause of death context: Acute respiratory infections (pneumonia/bronchitis), frequently following febrile viral illness, were among the leading killers of infants before antibiotics and routine immunization; sulfonamides began to appear in the late 1930s but were not reliably accessible in rural villages, so treatment commonly came from local “compounders” or informal practitioners rather than hospitals."
  - "Records/verification limits: Although late-colonial vital registration laws existed, rural birth/death registration in the United Provinces was often incomplete; for a village infant girl, family memory and oral account may be the only sources, and exact dates/clinical diagnoses are typically not independently verifiable in surviving archives without specific family documents."

Pushpa was born on August 19, 1936, in a village outside Raebareli in the United Provinces. Her parents’ house stood among fields of food crops, with neem and mango trees near the wells and along the boundaries. At home the adults spoke Awadhi.

At daybreak her mother lit the lamp at the household shrine and set a metal lota of water before the small images. Then she stoked the chulha, cooked, and kept the younger children close while she worked. Pushpa’s father tended his own narrow plots and the two milk animals. He cut fodder in the early hours and carried milk out in a metal pail to the lane. The buyer came on his rounds, wrote the quantity in a small book, and left without paying that day.

Pushpa was the fourth child in the house. Two sisters and a brother made noise in the courtyard and were fed first when food was ready. Before Pushpa, another baby had died. Her mother did not speak of that child, but she counted her children by touch when she settled them to sleep.

In January the nights turned hard with cold. Pushpa began to cough. The cough deepened and her breathing grew fast, each breath lifting the skin between her ribs. Her mother kept her against her body near the fire and rubbed warmed oil over her chest and back. When the baby’s fever did not break, a compounder came to the house, felt her skin and the soft spot on her head, and listened with his ear close to her chest. He left a paper twist of bitter powder and took coins from Pushpa’s father.

Pushpa worsened through the next days. She would not feed, and the cough pulled at her until she tired and went limp in her mother’s arms. She died before dawn on February 7, 1937. In the shed behind the house the buffalo shifted in the dark as the household woke to the space she left.
