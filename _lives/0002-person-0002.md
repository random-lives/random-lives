On the third day they gave the baby her name. Her mother could sit up again and eat broth from her own bowl. The house stood on a sandy rise above wet ground in the mixed forest, where the family kept small clearings for grain and fenced animals close.

Danu was the sixth daughter. They did not talk about the missing ones. One sister had lived long enough to walk and then was gone. Two had died before they had any strength in them. The oldest sister lay at the far side of the room with her husband and their small child. The grandparents slept near the hearth and rose slowly, but they still sorted grain, fed the fire, and watched the older children when work pulled everyone outside.

Her father spent the day with the cattle and pigs, driving them into oak stands for fallen acorns and keeping them out of the plots. He carried a ground stone axe and a flint knife traded in from other settlements. When he came back he smelled of smoke and animal fat, and he checked the pens before he ate.

Her mother returned to the fields as soon as she could stand the work. She hoed and pulled weeds with the baby bound tight against her chest. At sowing and again at harvest she brought a pinch of grain and a splash of milk to a post set at the edge of the fields, pressed the offering into the soil, and spoke the words the family used for growth and good weather.

In the heat of late summer, after Danu was given thin gruel and water from a storage pot, her belly turned. She passed stool again and again. Nothing stayed down. Her mouth went dry, her crying faded, and her limbs stopped fighting against the cloth. She died in her mother’s arms on August 10, 2296 BC.
