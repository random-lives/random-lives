Wérā was born in late winter, in a clay-plastered wattle house on a low rise above wet forest ground near the river. Smoke from the hearth sat in the rafters. The floor was hard-packed. Her mother named her in the same quick way she spoke to the other children, without a pause in her work.

She was the sixth child and the sixth girl. Two sisters had already died, one before her first year and one still small enough to be carried everywhere. The older girls filled the house with noise and errands. The eldest, thirty-six, lived there with her husband and a small child, and took charge when the adults were gone. Wérā’s grandparents stayed closest to the warmest part of the room. They watched the fire, sorted grain, and kept things moving when the younger hands were in the fields.

Her father’s days ran with the animals. He drove cattle and pigs between clearings and oak stands and kept them out of the planted strips. In the evenings he came back smelling of wet hide and dung. If someone arrived to trade, he did it at the edge of the yard—salt for hide, a better strap for a measure of grain—then he put the herd where he could hear them at night.

When spring came, Wérā’s mother went back to planting and weeding with the baby tied tight against her. Before the first work of the day she stopped at the settlement’s offering place and left meal and a little milk for the fields and the herd, then joined the others.

In the heat of late summer the river ran low and the water near the houses turned foul. Wérā began to pass thin stools again and again. Her mother fed her thin gruel and sips of water, and kept her against her chest to warm her when she went cold. The child’s mouth dried, her crying weakened, and her skin stayed slack under a pinch.

She died in the high part of the day, in her mother’s arms, before the evening work was done.
