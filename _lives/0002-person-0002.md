They called her Little One until she could take a name.

She was born in the deep cold, when snow lay under the oaks and the river ran slow beneath a lid of ice. Their house stood with other houses on higher ground above the wet places, timber and clay sealed against wind. A long fire burned along the floor. Her grandparents lived there, her parents, and an older sister with her husband and child. Work and food were shared, and so were the nights when a baby kept everyone awake.

She was the sixth daughter. Two sisters had already died in infancy. The women in the house kept the younger children close while they worked. When the soil loosened and the first field tasks began, her mother carried her out and back through the day: clearing old stalks, hoeing, and pressing seed into the dark earth. At the edge of the settlement they set aside a little grain and a little milk at a marked post, the offering made the same way each season.

Her father spent most days with the animals. He drove cattle and pigs into the clearings and the edges of the stubble, kept them moving so they did not foul the ground near the houses, and watched the tree line for wolves and for people coming up from the open country to the south.

In late summer, when the heat held on and flies clung to the animals, the baby’s stools turned watery and frequent. She stopped feeding well. They thinned porridge and offered the breast again and again. They kept a pot over the fire, boiled water, and cooled it before giving it to her in small amounts. Her mouth stayed dry. Her skin slackened at her wrists, and she no longer cried with strength.

Before the harvest work was finished, she went still in the night and did not wake.
