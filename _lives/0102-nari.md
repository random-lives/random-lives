# ethnicity: Eastern Sudanic (Nilotic-speaking) pastoralist/forager communities of the
#   Turkana Basin
# father_occupation: Small-scale pastoral herder (primarily goats/sheep; possibly a
#   few cattle)
# historical_context:
# - event: Multi-year drought episodes in the eastern Horn/East African rangelands leading
#     to water scarcity, pasture failure, and forced longer dry-season movements
#   timing: recurrent; especially likely in adulthood (ages ~20–60)
# - event: 'Indirect influence of the Kingdom of Aksum and Red Sea commerce (3rd–7th
#     c.): increased movement of prestige goods (beads/metal), new trading intermediaries,
#     and shifting demand for livestock products'
#   timing: mostly midlife (ages ~25–55)
# household_social_status: Poor / livestock-poor (few animals; often reliant on client
#   ties, fishing/foraging, or labor for others)
# household_structure_at_birth: Married monogamous nuclear family within a patrilineal
#   homestead (father and mother co-resident, plus nearby paternal kin)
# household_structure_at_death: Elder male with one remaining wife (others deceased/left),
#   plus grandchildren/other dependents
# language: Eastern Sudanic (Nilo-Saharan) — Nilotic language (primary)
# literacy: Neither read nor write
# marital_status: Married polygynously (2+ wives at some point; at time of death still
#   had 2+ or one surviving)
# mental_disorder: No likely modern-recognizable mental disorder (within expected range
#   given personality and context)
# migration: Stayed within the broader birth region (Turkana Basin), with regular seasonal/territorial
#   movements but no permanent long-distance relocation
# mother_occupation: 'Domestic manager and childcarer: cooking, water/fuel collection,
#   milk processing, hide/food preparation (primary role)'
# narrative_plan:
#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: 367
#     name: Tebo
#     narrative_role: Small-stock herder; demanding but not cruel, expects competence
#       and silence rather than talk. Relationship is practical and apprenticeship-like;
#       in old age he becomes dependent on Nari (frail/blind period ages 52–56).
#     role: father
#   - death_year: 356
#     name: Nari's mother (unnamed)
#     narrative_role: Domestic manager; protective, anxious about infant survival but
#       emotionally steady. Relationship is warm and instructive; she is the one who
#       pushes kin ties during crises and later brokers early marriage arrangements.
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: 372
#     name: Palo
#     narrative_role: Better-off kinsman; intermittently employs Nari as a herder during
#       the severe drought crisis and is a key voice in elder mediation after violent
#       disputes.
#     role: paternal uncle (frequent campmate/mentor)
#   children:
#   - birth_year: 336
#     death_age: 37
#     death_year: 373
#     name: Daku
#     narrative_role: Oldest son; capable herder and Nari’s main support in camp politics.
#       His adult death triggers long-term caregiving for grandchildren and reorders
#       authority in the household.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 346
#     death_age: 25
#     death_year: 371
#     name: Kalo
#     narrative_role: Second son; impulsive and conflict-prone, often the spark for
#       quarrels with neighbors. His early adult death adds to Nari’s sense that wealth
#       is fragile and men are easily taken.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 352
#     death_age: 28
#     death_year: 380
#     name: Meto
#     narrative_role: Youngest son; more cautious and attached to his mother Hadi. Dies
#       the same year as Nari (earlier in the year), leaving Nari surrounded mainly
#       by women and grandchildren at the end.
#     sex: M
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 28
#     connection: Occurs after his first marriage and early fatherhood; the theft worsens
#       insecurity and foreshadows the later drought crisis, pushing him to rely on
#       elders and kin rather than escalating feuds.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 32
#     connection: Directly constrains his ability to meet bridewealth/reciprocity; leads
#       to months working for uncle Palo and sets the stage for later status rebuilding
#       and eventual polygyny.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 40
#     connection: Part of a midlife cluster of aggressive incidents as he tries to police
#       livestock claims and defend reputation; contributes to simmering tensions that
#       later fuel domestic violence.
#     incident: physical_assault_perp
#   - age: 40
#     connection: Happens during a negotiation/travel episode amid rising status; later
#       becomes a source of whispered hostility and compensation demands that shape
#       how other camps view him.
#     incident: sexual_violence_perp
#   - age: 43
#     connection: Overlaps with polygyny and seasonal gatherings; suspicion about this
#       affair feeds the domestic violence cycle with Wero.
#     incident: extramarital_sex
#   - age: 44
#     connection: Triggered by accusations and resource disputes; mediation by elders
#       and affines alters household composition and helps explain why only one wife
#       remains later (Wero’s eventual separation).
#     incident: domestic_violence
#   - age: 46
#     connection: Occurs after a tense period of disputes; injury reduces his direct
#       participation in risky confrontations and increases reliance on sons/age-mates
#       for security.
#     incident: physical_assault
#   - age: 51
#     connection: A later fall converts accumulated wear/injury into a visible limp;
#       accelerates transition from active herding to supervisory/elder tasks and increases
#       dependence on sons.
#     incident: acquired_disability
#   - age: 54
#     connection: Caregiving for father coincides with Nari’s own disability; forces
#       delegation and deepens ties with grandchildren who assist.
#     incident: elderly_parents
#   - age: 60
#     connection: Begins after first son’s death; becomes central to household structure
#       as Nari becomes the stabilizing elder for grandchildren and widows.
#     incident: orphaned_children
#   - age: 62
#     connection: Hadi’s prolonged illness overlaps with grandchild caregiving and reduced
#       labor after sons’ deaths, tightening resources and increasing dependence on
#       neighbors/affines.
#     incident: sick_relative
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-7
#     key_events:
#     - Learns camp routines in a livestock-poor household; repeated infant deaths in
#       the family shape parental vigilance (311–318).
#     - 'First memories of drought movement: long walks to wells, learning to stay silent
#       and watchful (c. 316–318).'
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 8-17
#     key_events:
#     - Apprentices with father Tebo on goats/sheep; becomes known as observant and
#       unpanicked in scares (c. 319–328).
#     - Seasonal gatherings expose him to wider networks and the first trickle of prestige
#       goods (beads/metal) through inland barter (c. 326–328).
#     - Begins to negotiate status with age-mates while remaining reserved; avoids showy
#       boasting (c. 327–328).
#     phase: Later childhood / adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-33
#     key_events:
#     - Builds his own small herd share; marries first wife Kena (334).
#     - Older sister Suma dies (335), shifting responsibility and grief onto him.
#     - First son Daku born (336); gradual rise in standing through steady herd management
#       and kin reciprocity (336–344).
#     - Victim of goat theft during dry-season movements; learns limits of retaliation
#       and importance of elder mediation (338–340).
#     - Severe drought/herd disease crisis forces dependence on fish/foraging and herding
#       for uncle Palo to rebuild stock (342–345).
#     phase: Young adulthood
#   - age_range: 34-52
#     key_events:
#     - 'Expands household: second wife Wero (345) and third wife Hadi (351); polygyny
#       marks rising respectability though still not ''rich'' (345–352).'
#     - Indirect Aksum/Red Sea trade influence felt through more beads/metal circulation
#       at gatherings; increased competition and raiding talk (c. 350–360).
#     - 'A cluster of disputes: assaulting a younger kinsman over livestock accusations
#       (349–353), then coercive sex during a negotiation trip (350–352).'
#     - Recurring domestic conflict with Wero amid extramarital suspicions and resource
#       stress (354–356).
#     - Physical assault at a watering place dispute leaves long healing period, reducing
#       his willingness to travel into contested wells (357).
#     - Acquired disability from a later fall leads to a permanent limp and a shift
#       toward supervisory elder roles (361–363).
#     phase: Midlife (status consolidation and conflict)
#   - age_range: 53-68
#     key_events:
#     - Caregives for father Tebo during frailty/blindness; household authority transitions
#       toward Nari and then to sons (363–367).
#     - Adult sons begin dying (371, 373, 380), leading to long-term support of grandchildren
#       and at least one widowed daughter-in-law (371–380).
#     - Hadi’s prolonged wasting illness requires reorganized labor and ritual/healing
#       efforts (371–374).
#     - Dies from an accident in early 380 while still embedded in a household of one
#       wife plus grandchildren/dependents (380).
#     phase: Older age (caregiving and losses)
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Jara
#     prominence: Prominent ages ~28–46 during theft compensation, violence mediations,
#       and watering-place disputes.
#     relationship: Neighboring camp elder/mediator
#   - name: Ruma
#     prominence: Prominent ages ~38–42; reappears during compensation and later as
#       a helper when Nari becomes disabled.
#     relationship: Younger patrilineal kinsman whom Nari assaulted; later reconciled
#   - name: Gilo
#     prominence: Prominent ages ~41–48; catalyst for domestic conflict and gossip networks.
#     relationship: Affair partner from a nearby camp
#   - name: Leko
#     prominence: Prominent ages ~35–45, including the trip during which the sexual
#       violence incident occurs.
#     relationship: Age-mate and occasional travel companion on negotiation/trade trips
#   - name: Wero's brother (named Tano)
#     prominence: Prominent ages ~43–45; influences Wero’s eventual separation.
#     relationship: Affine who confronts Nari during domestic violence mediation
#   partners:
#   - name: Kena
#     narrative_role: First wife (monogamy phase); relationship starts with pragmatic
#       cooperation. Ends via death after recurrent fevers/childbirth complications;
#       her kin ties initially help Nari stabilize after early losses.
#     relationship_end_year: 343
#     relationship_start_year: 334
#   - name: Wero
#     narrative_role: Second wife; strong-willed and socially connected. Relationship
#       becomes conflictual in Nari’s early middle age, especially during suspicions
#       about his affairs; leaves to natal kin after repeated disputes/mediations (not
#       a clean 'divorce' but separation).
#     relationship_end_year: 365
#     relationship_start_year: 345
#   - name: Hadi
#     narrative_role: Third wife and last remaining at his death; manages household
#       through late-life caregiving years. Develops prolonged wasting illness ages
#       60–63; relationship is close but strained by labor shortages and loss of adult
#       sons.
#     relationship_end_year: 380
#     relationship_start_year: 351
#   siblings:
#   - birth_year: 309
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 309
#     name: Aro
#     narrative_role: Firstborn who died in infancy; his absence is a quiet pressure
#       on the parents to protect later children and is mentioned in laments during
#       hard years.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 310
#     death_age: 25
#     death_year: 335
#     name: Suma
#     narrative_role: Older sister and closest surviving sibling; she teaches Nari practical
#       camp skills and helps buffer him from adult conflict; her death as a young adult
#       becomes a reference point for grief and responsibility.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: 311
#     death_age: 68
#     death_year: 380
#     name: Nari
#     narrative_role: Protagonist; quiet, steady under stress, observant and strategic
#       with animals and people; rises from livestock-poor origins to ordinary respectability.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 313
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 313
#     name: Kori
#     narrative_role: Younger brother who dies around birth; reinforces the household’s
#       sense of vulnerability and the mother’s fear of losing children.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 315
#     death_age: 1
#     death_year: 316
#     name: Baki
#     narrative_role: Youngest brother who dies as a toddler; remembered in later ritual
#       meals when the family recounts the ‘thin years’ of childhood sickness.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Others trust him with night watches and herd decisions, aiding his
#       rise in standing; it also makes him seem emotionally distant during grief.
#     scene: During drought movements and later during the watering-place attack recovery,
#       Nari stays outwardly calm, speaks little, and focuses on immediate tasks (count
#       animals, ration water) rather than panic or rumination.
#     timing: Visible from adolescence; emphasized ages 18–34 and again after age 46
#     trait: Very low Neuroticism (5th percentile)
#   - consequence: He gains a reputation for being hard to read; fewer allies-by-charm,
#       but fewer impulsive entanglements—except where reputation threats force him
#       into fights.
#     scene: At seasonal gatherings he stands behind talkative age-mates, listening
#       and watching exchanges; he speaks only when necessary and avoids boast contests.
#     timing: Adolescence through midlife
#     trait: Low Extraversion (22nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Helps rebuild after the drought crisis and negotiate compensation
#       after thefts/fights; also makes him effective in disputes, which can escalate
#       conflict when others feel cornered.
#     scene: He anticipates pasture depletion, proposes earlier moves, and keeps unusually
#       careful mental tallies of debts/compensation livestock during mediations.
#     timing: Young adulthood into midlife (ages ~20–50)
#     trait: Higher Intelligence (75th percentile)
#   - consequence: Contributes to physical assault perpetration and harsh household
#       discipline; later mediations reduce his standing slightly and strain affinal
#       ties.
#     scene: He is not habitually deceitful, but he is blunt and controlling when he
#       believes someone is lying about animals; in domestic conflict he prioritizes
#       authority and order over harmony.
#     timing: Midlife conflict cluster (ages ~38–46)
#     trait: Lower Agreeableness (34th percentile) with moderate Honesty-Humility (61st)
# number_of_children: '3'
# number_of_siblings: '4'
# occupation: Pastoral herder (household head managing goats/sheep; some cattle if acquired)
# religion: 'Pastoralist household and communal rites: prayers/offerings for livestock
#   fertility, rain, protection; elders lead rituals; occasional divination/healing'

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During a dry-season move between wells, a small group from a neighboring
#     camp slipped into the night kraal and drove off several goats; he tracked them
#     for a day but recovered only one animal and had to accept compensation negotiations
#     through elders.
#   reasoning: Livestock theft and opportunistic taking of animals/gear are common risks
#     in mobile pastoral economies, even for modest herders, over a long lifetime.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Age 27–29; recurring pattern (at least two theft attempts, one successful)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: A severe drought and disease in the small-stock herd killed many goats and
#     left the household dependent on dried fish, gathered foods, and loans of milk
#     animals from affines; bridewealth obligations were delayed and he spent months
#     herding for a better-off kinsman to rebuild stock.
#   reasoning: Arid ecology brings recurrent drought, disease in herds, and losses from
#     raiding; starting livestock-poor makes at least one episode of severe loss or
#     near-destitution fairly likely.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Age 31–34; sustained period
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: After a dispute over meat distribution and suspicions about his time away
#     with other women, one wife struck him with a cooking stick and threw hot ash;
#     he responded by restraining and beating her, and the quarrel drew in her brothers
#     and the camp elders for mediation.
#   reasoning: Intimate-partner violence against men can occur but is comparatively
#     uncommon; with polygyny, household conflict is possible, yet severe repeated wife-on-husband
#     beating is still a minority outcome.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 43–45; recurring pattern (several violent quarrels over ~2 years)
#   type: domestic_violence
# - event: In a confrontation at a watering place over access order, he was set upon
#     by two men and hit with clubs and stones, leaving him with broken ribs and a deep
#     scalp wound that took weeks to heal.
#   reasoning: Fights, retaliation, and raiding-related beatings are common hazards
#     for adult men in pastoral settings over many decades, making at least one serious
#     assault plausible.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 46; single event
#   type: physical_assault
# - event: While traveling with other herders to negotiate livestock matters, he forced
#     sex on a young woman staying with relatives in a temporary camp, using threats
#     and his group’s leverage over her kin; afterward her family demanded compensation
#     and the matter was handled through elders rather than any formal court.
#   reasoning: Coercive sex exists in many societies, but his profile (low neuroticism,
#     moderate agreeableness, higher honesty-humility) and culturally available marital
#     access reduce the chance relative to participation in fights.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 39–41; single event
#   type: sexual_violence_perp
# - event: He beat a younger man from his extended family during a dispute over a goat
#     and accusations of lying about herd counts, leaving the man badly bruised and
#     unable to herd for several days; compensation was later arranged with livestock
#     and public apologies.
#   reasoning: Given confirmed perpetrator violence, the most common manifestation is
#     non-lethal assault in fights, raids, punishment, or disputes over animals/women,
#     which is widespread among adult men.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 38–42; recurring pattern (multiple serious fights)
#   type: physical_assault_perp
# - event: After a fall on rocky ground while driving animals, his knee/hip never fully
#     recovered; he walked with a limp thereafter and shifted from long-distance herding
#     to more supervisory and camp-based tasks.
#   reasoning: Partial hearing/vision loss, mobility impairment from prior injuries,
#     or chronic joint problems increase with age; still, many remain functional without
#     a clearly “disabling” threshold.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Onset age 50–52; sustained lifelong disability thereafter
#   type: acquired_disability
# - event: His remaining wife developed a prolonged wasting illness with recurrent fevers;
#     he and the household reorganized labor around her care, sought divination and
#     herbal treatments, and relied on neighbors for water fetching during her worst
#     periods.
#   reasoning: Extended family care is normal, and elder men often organize resources
#     for ill spouses/kin; having only one remaining wife late in life suggests illness
#     episodes among close family were plausible.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 60–63; sustained period
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: When his adult sons died, their children and at least one widowed daughter-in-law
#     attached themselves to his household; he provided animals for milk and arranged
#     protection and future marriages/alliances for the grandchildren.
#   reasoning: All three sons died before him, making it likely that at least one set
#     of grandchildren (and possibly a son’s widow) needed his household’s long-term
#     support.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 55–68; sustained period
#   type: orphaned_children
# - event: In his late adulthood his father became frail and partially blind; he took
#     responsibility for feeding him, assigning a grandchild to escort him, and ensuring
#     he was included in ritual meals and decisions until his death.
#   reasoning: In high-mortality settings many parents die before a child reaches mature
#     adulthood; nonetheless some men do provide for frail parents, especially if they
#     themselves live long.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 52–56; sustained period
#   type: elderly_parents
# - event: Despite having wives, he maintained a discreet affair with a woman from a
#     nearby camp during seasonal gatherings, exchanging small gifts (goat meat, beads,
#     help with water hauling); the liaison periodically reignited household conflict
#     when it became suspected.
#   reasoning: Despite polygyny, extramarital affairs and partner-taking disputes occur;
#     opportunity during travel/raiding/trading and household tensions make at least
#     one episode plausible.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 41–48; recurring pattern
#   type: extramarital_sex

Nari was born in the Turkana Basin in the late rains of 311, in an acacia-and-commiphora plain where camps shifted between thornbush kraals and a few reliable wells. His people spoke a Nilotic tongue and ordered life through family, cattle, and elders rather than any distant court. Far to the northeast the Aksumite kingdom was expanding its trade along the Red Sea, and some of that wealth trickled inland—beads and bits of metal passed hand to hand through many camps before reaching the basin. At home his mother kept the hearth and milk vessels, and his father Tebo guarded a small herd of goats and a few sheep, tallying each animal lost as carefully as richer men tallied gains.

Nari's parents had already lost a firstborn, Arok, before Nari could remember. His sister Suma was born in 310. When Nari came, they handled him with anxious care: his mother kept him close in the shade and watched his mouth for dryness when the wind turned hot. Another baby, Korim, died at birth in 313. The youngest, Bakur, lived long enough to toddle after the goats and died the next year. Nari learned early to stay quiet when adults talked, watching their faces for signs of trouble.

Suma became the person who pulled him into the ordinary work of camp. She showed him how to settle a skin bag so it did not leak, how to find the last damp sand in a dry riverbed, and how to scrape hides with a stone flake without cutting through. Tebo trained him in the older boy's tasks early: watching goats in thorn scrub, keeping them from straying into another camp's grazing, and standing night watch when hyenas circled. Nari did not chatter with other boys. He sat on a rock above the animals and studied their movement, then moved them before they scattered. When a kid went missing he did not shout; he looked for tracks where the dust held an edge.

At fifteen he joined older youths on seasonal gatherings where people traded dried fish, hides, and fat, and where a few strings of beads appeared, bright against skin and leather. Nari watched the exchanges more than he joined the jokes. He liked the early hours before heat, when the goats were calm and he could hear their bells and the soft clack of hooves on stones. He avoided boastful contests and disliked men who talked over elders.

Through his late youth he built his share of the family's herd slowly, receiving a few animals from Tebo and adding kids when nannies bore well. He learned which wells held water longest and which routes other camps avoided. By twenty he had enough standing among age-mates to speak at gatherings, though he rarely did.

He married Kena in 334, after months of negotiation with her family. The bridewealth was small and paid slowly, and Tebo leaned on his brother Palo for help. Kena moved into Nari's hut and worked the hearth with practiced hands. The next year Suma died at twenty-five after weeks of fever and weakness. Nari helped carry water and gathered branches for shade, but he did not speak much at her bedside. After her death he stopped going to gatherings for a time and stayed close to the herd.

His first son, Daku, was born in 336. Nari took the child on his hip as he moved between goats, letting the boy feel the warmth of their backs. Even as a small child Daku was steady and watchful, like his father. By 338 Nari had enough animals that he kept a separate small kraal at night, though it sat close to Tebo's. That dry season, during a move between wells, thieves came in the dark. They cut the thorn fence and drove off several goats. Nari woke to the sound of hooves and the brief muffled calls of men trying not to be heard. At first light he followed tracks with two companions and found the trail bending toward a neighboring camp's grazing. He recovered one goat and sat with the elder Jara to negotiate compensation. The talks were tense, full of careful phrasing and long silences. Nari accepted a settlement that did not replace what he lost, and the grievance lingered between camps for years.

A worse blow came in 343. The rains failed twice, and sickness ran through the goats. Nari's household ate dried fish more than milk and spent days collecting bitter roots and small fruits from scrub. The herd shrank until he could count it on his fingers. Bridewealth obligations for future marriages were delayed; debts became talk that followed him. Kena died that year after a final fever that left her cold even at midday. In 344 Nari went to Palo's camp and herded Palo's stock for months to rebuild his own. He did not complain. He rose before dawn, checked hooves for cuts, and moved the animals before others stirred. He kept tally of what he was owed, and when Palo tried to press him into another season of work, Nari named exact numbers—goats lent, goats repaid, kids born—and Palo backed down with a short laugh.

Nari remarried in 345 to Wero, whose brothers carried themselves with confidence and whose family expected to be treated with respect. Their first years together were busy: managing the household as it grew, arguing over grazing routes, settling disputes with words before they turned to sticks. A second son, Kalot, was born in 346. Kalot was quick-tempered from childhood, always the first to shout when goats scattered or when another boy touched his things. In 351 Nari took a third wife, Hadi, after a period of rebuilding and careful reciprocity. That same year Hadi bore him a third son, Metung. Taking multiple wives marked him as a man who had climbed from his childhood poverty into ordinary respect.

Midlife brought conflict. In 349 a younger cousin, Ruma, was accused of hiding a goat that went missing from the kraal. Nari confronted him in front of others. Ruma spoke too quickly, and Nari decided he lied. He struck him, then beat him hard enough that Ruma could not herd for days. Compensation followed: livestock transferred, apologies spoken, and a public ending to the dispute. Ruma avoided him for years afterward.

In 351 Nari traveled with his age-mate Leko to settle livestock matters with another group. In a temporary camp he forced sex on a young woman staying with relatives, using threats while his companions stood nearby. The woman's family demanded compensation. Elders handled it through negotiation and payment rather than any prison or execution. Nari paid, but the story traveled. Men from that camp remembered, and when Nari came to wells or gatherings where they watered their animals, they spoke to him only when necessary.

He also took a lover. In 354, during seasonal gatherings, he began meeting Gilom from a nearby camp. He brought her goat meat and beads, helped her carry water, and met her away from the main fires. Wero heard whispers and watched him closely. In 355, after a quarrel over meat distribution and his absences, she hit him with a cooking stick and threw hot ash. Nari restrained her and beat her. Her brother Tangor came to confront him, and elder Jara mediated, forcing public statements and a transfer of animals to cool the dispute.

The violence between Nari and Wero returned more than once over the next year. Hadi stayed out of the quarrels, tending her own fire and keeping Metung close. Wero's kin visited more often, watching.

Nari's mother died in 356 after a short illness. She had been the one who smoothed disputes with gifts of milk and quiet words to wives' families, and without her the household ran harder. Nari had little patience for persuasion. He gave orders and expected them followed.

In 357 a fight at a watering place left Nari injured. A dispute over access order flared into shouting and then clubs. Two men struck him with stones and wood; ribs cracked and his scalp opened. He lay for weeks with pain when he breathed and could not walk far. Daku, now twenty-one, took over the longer herding routes while Nari healed. Kalot, eleven, helped drive the animals to water each morning. Nari snapped at both of them when they moved the goats too slowly.

He recovered enough to work, but in 362 he fell on rocky ground while driving animals. His knee and hip never set right. After that he walked with a limp and avoided long chases. He shifted toward camp decisions—when to move, which relatives to approach, how much compensation to demand—and left the longest herding to his sons. Daku managed the animals with quiet competence. Kalot argued with other herders and came back with bruises and grievances that Nari had to settle.

In 365 Wero returned to her natal family after another bitter quarrel. Hadi remained, and Nari's household shrank to her and the youngest son Metung, now fourteen. That same year Tebo became frail and partly blind. Nari fed him, assigned a grandchild to guide him, and made sure he sat close to the meat when animals were slaughtered. Tebo died in 367, after two seasons of dependence that Nari managed with tight control.

Loss followed. Kalo died in 371 at twenty-five, taken quickly by a fever after a hard dry-season trek. Palo, his father's brother who had helped him rebuild after the drought, died in 372. Daku died in 373 at thirty-seven, leaving children behind. Those grandchildren and at least one widowed daughter-in-law moved into Nari’s compound, and Nari set aside milk animals for them and negotiated future marriages and protection with affines. At sixty, Hadi developed a wasting sickness with recurrent fevers. For three years Nari reorganized the household around her care. He sought divination, gave small offerings—milk poured on the ground at the edge of camp, a piece of fat set aside for ancestors—and asked elders to speak the names of the dead so they would not trouble the living. He relied on neighbors for water hauling when his limp and age made the distance too much.

Meto, his youngest son, died in 380 at twenty-eight. Nari’s camp held more children than adults then, and his temper softened into short instructions and long silences. On the first day of that year he went out with goats near rocky ground. An animal broke away toward thorn and stone. He chased it with his limp and fell hard. The injury ended his life that day.

His family placed his body on open ground away from the huts and marked the spot with stones and thorn branches, leaving a small dish of milk and a strip of goat fat as offerings while elders spoke the names of his father and sister.
