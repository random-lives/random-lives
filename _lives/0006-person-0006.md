# Age at death: 81
# Agreeableness (% rank): 62
# Birth date: July 13, 36308 BC
# Birth year: 36308 BC
# Climate now: Today the Hoshangabad–Jabalpur corridor has a warm subtropical monsoonal

# Climate then: Around 36,308 BC (late Pleistocene), the Narmada valley would likely
#   have experienced a cooler, drier-than-today climate with a weaker monsoon and more
#   open vegetation overall. River flow and sediment load would have fluctuated strongly

The stretch of the Narmada around today’s Hoshangabad–Jabalpur corridor is now a worked river: fields, towns, regulated water, hot summers under a strong monsoon. In 36,308 BC it was a wider corridor with shifting channels. The air ran cooler. The rains came, but long dry spells opened the land. The river split across gravel and sand, then folded back on itself. Backwaters formed in low places and went stagnant, then shrank to mud.

We’ll call him Kanu, though his real name is unknowable.

He was the third child of eleven. The camp held many children at once. They crawled and fell near the fire. Older ones carried smaller ones on their hips and dragged them back from the bank when the sand gave way.

His father died while Kanu was still small. After that, the man’s name stopped coming up in talk around the fire. The group kept moving. His mother kept working and kept having children. Kanu got pulled into the work early. He fetched water in a skin, brought back sticks from the edge of the trees, and kept the youngest from wandering onto a soft bar where the surface held until it didn’t.

He grew into a boy who copied what already worked. When someone tried a new path to a seep or set a different kind of simple trap line, he watched the first day. If it paid off, he did the same thing the next day, with no comment. If it failed, he acted as if he’d never noticed it. He didn’t look for better ways on his own. He also didn’t drop old habits until they cost him.

In his early teens the monsoon failed hard. The backwaters that usually kept fish into the dry months turned into shallow bowls. The band walked farther from the main channel to find water that bled out of a cut bank. Meat came less often. They ate more tubers and small animals. Kanu carried a digging stick and learned the feel of ground that held something worth pulling up. When people dried strips of meat by the fire to make it last a few days, he reached too early and got his hand knocked away. He learned to wait when eyes were on him. When eyes weren’t on him, he tried his luck.

Fire shaped the year. Late in the dry season lightning took the grass or people set small burns along a margin to open ground and push animals. Smoke hung low. Ash made tracks easy to read. A camp could be abandoned fast if a wind shifted. Kanu was slow about his own things. He left a scraper where he last used it, then searched while others were already lifting loads. His mother snapped at him for it. He didn’t argue. For a time he kept a tighter bundle. Then he went loose again.

As a young man he became a generalist in the plain sense: useful, never the best. He could follow sign in sand and on hard ground. He threw well enough to matter. He could sit long with a fish basket and not spoil it by shifting and talking. When stone edges dulled, he struck flakes from river cobbles with quick, controlled blows. He didn’t show off. He also didn’t take risks that made new tools when old ones still cut.

He took one partner and stayed with her. They returned to the same terraces when the river allowed it, used the same sleeping place when there was room, and spoke little about the division of work because it stayed the same.

They had seven children. With the first baby he held it stiff, unsure where the weight should rest. His partner shifted his hands and pushed the child against his chest until it stopped crying. After that he managed. When the older children could walk without falling, he expected them to carry kindling and watch a younger sibling while adults worked. When a child failed, he didn’t explode. He gave a short instruction. If it still didn’t happen, he did it himself with a hard look that made the child look away.

In adulthood the river took a place they used. After a season of heavy rain, the Narmada rose and cut into a low terrace where they’d slept on soft ground close to water. In the morning a section of bank fell away. A bundle they’d tucked back under roots slid into the current.

Kanu ran toward it without thinking. He waded in up to his thighs and reached. The pull grabbed at his legs and turned his feet on the stones. Someone behind him shouted his name and then another voice joined in, sharper. He stopped. He backed out, dripping, and stood on the new edge with his jaw set.

They shifted to higher gravel where sleeping bruised hips and shoulders. For weeks he kept his own small things tied higher than before. He checked the knot more than once a day. When others laughed, he didn’t answer.

When the flood dropped, a channel they’d used for years was gone under fresh sand. A new cut left still water behind that swarmed with insects. Kanu tried to force the old path anyway. He walked it until it ended in fresh mud and standing water. The younger hunters laughed at him. He turned back without a word. The next day he followed them and stopped testing the old route.

The sharpest dispute of his life was over meat. After a successful kill on the valley margin, the carcass lay open and steaming while flies gathered. People moved in close. Cuts were taken and carried back to households.

Kanu cut a strip for his own—thicker than most, from a good part. A man called him out loud and named the cut. The circle tightened. Kanu didn’t argue. He set the strip down, sliced it in two, and handed back the larger half. That ended the shouting. Later, when portions were divided again, he took what he was given and said nothing. After that, he watched that man’s hands when food was being cut and passed.

Old age came in steps. He stopped taking the longest forays. He chose work that kept him close: keeping a small fire alive, touching up edges, showing a younger person where a seep held late in the dry season. He still followed talk and corrected a detail when someone named a place wrong. But his body slowed. He rose stiff, walked with care on loose stones, and sat down more often.

In the cool season of 36,227 BC the river ran low and clear. The nights bit harder than they had when he was young. One morning he stood, took a few steps, and sat down again as if his legs had quit without warning. He tried to get up and couldn’t make his knees hold. Water came to his mouth. He swallowed, then turned his head away from more.

The day went on around him: stone struck stone, children cried and were hushed, someone shook ash from a hide. His breathing stayed shallow and even. By late afternoon his chest lifted, paused, and did not lift again.
