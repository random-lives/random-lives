# demographics:
#   Subregion: South Asia (Indus-Ganges & peninsular river/coastal zones)
#   Subsubregion: Narmada valley (around modern Hoshangabad–Jabalpur corridor)
#   Environment: A broad river-valley corridor with a braided/seasonally shifting Narmada channel, gravel/sand bars, and extensive river terraces. The surroundings would have been a mosaic of open woodland and grassland with patches of denser gallery forest along watercourses, plus marshy backwaters/oxbow areas in low-lying zones; large mammals would have been common in the wider plains and valley margins.
#   Cultural tradition: undifferentiated
#   Climate then: Around 36,308 BC (late Pleistocene), the Narmada valley would likely have experienced a cooler, drier-than-today climate with a weaker monsoon and more open vegetation overall. River flow and sediment load would have fluctuated strongly with seasonal rains and longer climatic swings, producing active terrace building, exposed gravels, and periodically expansive floodplains rather than a stable, densely forested landscape.
#   Climate now: Today the Hoshangabad–Jabalpur corridor has a warm subtropical monsoonal climate with hot summers, a strong summer rainy season, and mild winters. The valley is heavily modified by agriculture, towns, and regulated river flow, with remaining natural vegetation largely in patches (riparian strips and nearby forested hills/parks).

# events:
#   1. {'event': 'One or more years of markedly weak monsoon rains leading to low river levels, shrinking backwaters, and a lean-season food squeeze (more reliance on stored/dried foods, tubers, small game).', 'timing': 'repeated episodes; most salient in adolescence to mid-adulthood (ages ~12–45)'}
#   2. {'event': 'A major Narmada flood season that scoured sand/gravel bars, cut new channels, and temporarily destroyed/relocated favored campsites and fishing/foraging spots on low terraces.', 'timing': 'at least once in adulthood (ages ~20–60)'}
#   3. {'event': 'Regular late-dry-season grass/woodland fires (lightning or set by people) that temporarily changed cover, increased visibility for hunting, and altered where edible plants were gathered.', 'timing': 'recurring annually; especially impactful during prime hunting years (ages ~15–50)'}
#   4. {'event': 'Personal incident: a sharp intra-band dispute over meat-sharing or accusations of taking more than one’s share, resolved through public discussion/pressure rather than violence (given his moderate agreeableness and ordinary standing).', 'timing': 'adulthood (ages ~25–55)'}

The Narmada valley he was born into was not the warm, crowded river corridor it is now, with fields pressed to the banks and water held back behind concrete. In 36,308 BC the air ran cooler and drier. The rains came, but the river did not hold steady. It split and rejoined across a wide bed, braiding around gravel bars and pale sand. In the dry months it narrowed into channels a person could wade. In the rains it rose hard and fast, carrying stones that clicked and rolled under the surface. Above the active channel, river terraces lay open—patches of woodland, long stretches of grass, and thicker trees tight along water.

We’ll call him Kanu.

He was the third of eleven children. The camp shifted with the season and the food. His first clear memories were close and physical: the cold push of water around his shins; the stink and shine of fish laid open on a flat stone; the slap of a skin bag dropped on sand. His father was present at the edge of those early years, a man who moved with practiced care. Then he was gone. After that, Kanu saw the change in what adults did: fewer voices at night, quicker packing at dawn, his mother’s hands always busy.

As a boy he stayed near his older sisters. He followed them along the terrace edge where seep water kept small plants alive late into the dry season. He watched where they pushed a digging stick into soft ground and pulled out roots, and how they tested a new thing with a small bite before passing it on. When older children threw stones at birds or scrambled up a leaning tree, he watched once and tried only what worked. He spoke less than most. When he did speak, it was brief—one phrase, or none.

When he was in his early teens, one season went wrong. The rains failed and the valley showed it fast. Backwaters shrank into strings of warm pools with scum on the surface. The river ran low enough to expose long ridges of gravel that clattered underfoot. The band walked farther each day. They left camp before the light was full and came back later, shoulders marked by load straps. There was less meat to cut and more time with digging sticks and woven carriers. Kanu carried what he could. He ate what was there.

He watched an older man sit with a long bone between his feet and strike it again and again with a stone until it opened. The man scraped out what he could and passed the pieces around without talk. Kanu remembered the motion and the patience.

By the time he was grown, he moved in the middle of the group’s rhythm—useful, not watched. He tracked with the others along the valley margin. He fished in the shallows when the channel fell quiet. When a carcass lay open, he could take his share and separate skin from flesh without wasting it. When someone’s stone edge dulled, he made a new one from river cobbles, turning the rock in his palm until he found a face that broke clean. He worked without flourish. He took pride in tools that did their job.

He took a partner and stayed with her. They shared tasks without ceremony. When they disagreed, it showed in what they did: a hand pulled away from a shared load, a few steps of distance while walking, then the two of them returning to the same work because the day still needed finishing. He favored a familiar high terrace for sleeping, where wind kept insects down and the ground stayed firm when the river rose.

Seven children were born into his shelter over the years. He learned the weight of each stage—an infant who had to be carried, a toddler who moved too fast toward danger, a child old enough to fetch water without spilling it all. One baby died. After that, Kanu tightened the cord on his pack, checked knots twice, and kept the others closer when the bank crumbled underfoot.

In his thirties the river took more than it had in years. The rain did not ease for days, and the sound of the water changed—deeper, continuous, filling the night. A bank where they had cached dried meat folded into the current with a dull crack. People ran. Feet slipped on wet clay. Hands grabbed at bundles and skins. Kanu went after a floating bag until the water climbed to his waist and the pull caught his thighs. Someone shouted. He stopped, backed out, and stood shaking on the edge, looking at what the river carried away.

When the flood dropped, the valley had rearranged itself. A channel that had been easy to cross filled with new sand. A bend cut through and left an oxbow behind that stank of trapped fish. The old paths didn’t lead cleanly to the same places. Kanu adapted the way he always did: small tests, repeated what worked, no claims that the land would return to old habits.

The sharpest conflict of his adult life came over meat. After a kill on open ground, people crowded in close. Flies rose in clouds. An argument started when someone said Kanu had taken a thicker strip than his share. The words were loud enough to pull everyone’s attention into a tight circle.

Kanu looked at the piece in his hands. He set it down. He met the accuser’s eyes. He said only that it came from the side where he had been cutting. Then he picked up a stone blade and split the strip, handing back the larger half.

The noise thinned. An older woman clicked her tongue, irritated at the fuss. Later, when the meat was smoked and divided again, Kanu took what he was given. He did not go looking for another argument, and he did not forget who had shouted.

As he aged, strength left in steps a person could measure. First he stopped taking the longest runs after game. Then a knee stiffened after nights on damp ground. He shifted toward work that needed steadiness more than speed: mending a carry strap, keeping children from edging toward deep water, showing a teenager how to strike stone so the flake came off clean instead of shattering.

He still walked out with the group in the cool hours, but he kept to the side where he could turn back without slowing anyone.

In his last years the seasons pressed on him. Dry wind scraped his throat. The first rains made his joints ache. He ate more slowly and chose softer pieces without comment. He sat nearer the fire and turned his body to keep smoke out of his eyes.

One evening in the cool season, with the river running clear and low, the camp began to pack before moving on. Kanu didn’t rise with the first lift of loads. He watched people tighten cords and settle bundles across shoulders. When he stood, it was with help. He walked a short distance to higher ground where the air was cleaner and the wind kept the smoke moving.

On the morning of October 12, 36,227 BC, he woke and his legs didn’t answer. His breath stayed shallow. He took water once, then turned his head away from more. The day went on around him—stone struck against stone, a child’s cry cut short, the thump of a bundle set down. By late afternoon his eyes stayed closed. His chest rose, paused, and did not rise again.
