Shah Jahan was born on October 16, 1688, in the low, wet ground outside Chittagong, where ponds and creeks cut through the fields and the air stayed warm and damp. His parents spoke the coastal Bengali of their village. They lived in a one-room hut built on another man’s land. Inside there were a few pots, a reed mat, and a bundle of cloth for bedding.

His father took whatever fishing work came with the season—pushing a boat out before dawn, hauling nets when the catch was good, gutting fish at the edge of the water, and laying them on bamboo frames to dry when buyers wanted dried fish. His mother went out to labor in a better-off house: washing cooking vessels, pounding grain, carrying water, and coming home with a measure of rice or a copper coin tied into the corner of her sari.

The older children kept the household moving when the parents were gone. The eldest daughter watched the cooking fire and lifted the baby away from the hearth when he wriggled too close. The boy ran messages to neighbors and to the market path. The other sister kept him quiet when he cried and rocked him on her hip until he slept.

They kept Muslim practice in the way poor households did it—short prayers at home, the men at the mosque on Fridays when work allowed, and a ta’wiz tied to the child to ward off fever.

In July 1689, after days of rain and thick heat, Shah Jahan’s breathing turned fast and tight. He would not take milk. His ribs showed with each pull of his chest. By the next day he lay limp on the mat, sweating and struggling for air. He died on July 18, before the afternoon call to prayer.
