Mira entered the world in the wet forest country inland of the sea, where low ridges broke into streams that fed larger rivers. No king ruled there. People lived in small camps that shifted with food and season, tied together by marriage, kin, and old feuds. Mira’s people spoke a tongue that belonged to that place and nowhere else.

He was born into a shared camp household, two related families using the same shelter space and the same fire. His mother, Wana, kept him close on her hip and on her back while she gathered palm fruits and dug for roots. She set small traps for ground birds and rodents along the edge of a clearing, and she checked them when the light was still low and the insects were manageable. His father was absent. No one in the camp spoke of him to Mira as a person who would return. When Mira asked, Wana cut him off with a short phrase and pushed a piece of roasted tuber into his hand.

He grew up the third child in a crowded line of brothers and sisters, always bodies underfoot, always someone crying, laughing, or coughing in the dark. His oldest brother, Taku, took charge of small things early. Taku showed him how to keep a coal alive under ash during rain and how to carry water without spilling it. Mira’s sisters—Pona and Kiri and two younger girls—made him run errands, then defended him when another child took his food. They gave each other nicknames that had nothing to do with adulthood, and they did not drop them when they grew.

Deaths sat close to the camp. One baby brother died before he walked. Another sister died at seven, thin and hot, with sores at the corners of her mouth. Mira learned the rules about what could be touched and what had to be left alone. He learned how adults spoke softly and then abruptly turned their voices sharp again when a child lingered too long.

As a boy he followed older children down narrow paths where vines snagged ankles. He ate small sweet fruits from shrubs and chewed the soft heart of a palm when someone cut it open. He liked mornings best, when the air still moved and the forest smell was clean. At the main fire he listened for the rhythm of talk, and he laughed loud when other boys teased someone who missed a throw. He joined in fast, even when he did not fully understand the point, and he learned to copy the timing.

The adults started taking him on short hunts when he could keep quiet for a stretch. He carried bundles and fetched arrows that missed. He had trouble remembering long instructions given all at once. When someone told him three steps—go to the stream bend, look for the dark stones, then circle back by the fallen trunk—he often came back by the wrong way and got shouted at. He learned to ask for one step at a time. He did not enjoy being corrected in front of others. He went stiff, then pushed himself into work that could not be argued with: sharpening a point, twisting fiber cord, stripping bark.

In his late teens he began moving with the men more regularly. He was good at noticing fresh tracks in soft ground and at holding his position when others flushed animals. He stayed patient in rain, when some men grew restless and broke cover. He did not make clever plans. He did what he was shown, and he did it the same way every time. The older hunters valued that. They stopped watching him so closely.

He married into another band in his early twenties, after a season of visits between camps and gifts passed back and forth. His wife was Kinara. She was quick with her hands and quicker with her words. When she decided something was settled, she spoke once and did not return to it. Mira followed her to her people’s territory, a nearby stretch of forest and river with familiar animals but different paths and different old stories. He became an in-law among men who had grown up together. He listened more than he talked. He worked hard at the tasks no one argued over: cutting poles, hauling meat, mending nets.

When he was between twenty-four and twenty-six, he traveled with others between camps near the rivers and the forest edge, sleeping in a shared shelter on packed earth. During the night someone took his hunting kit from where he had tucked it close to the wall: his best stone-tipped spear point and the cordage he had twisted himself. In the morning he tore through bedding and leaf mats, then went straight to Kinara with his empty hands. He confronted two young men who had been awake late, laughing. They denied it with flat faces. The camp did not split over a spear point, but Mira remembered who watched without helping search. For weeks he borrowed gear, returning it carefully each time, until he knapped a new point and traded for cord.

His first son, Ka, was born not long after. Mira carried the infant when Kinara’s arms tired, pacing at the edge of the camp until the crying eased. Ka lived eleven years. Mira’s second son, Nõ, died at four after a sudden sickness that emptied him out. Mira had carried Nõ to water and back so many times in one day that his arms shook. He did not speak much during that period. He took on more work without being asked and snapped at one of Kinara’s brothers when the man reached for a piece of meat before the children had eaten. Kinara answered him sharply, and Mira swallowed the argument and went out to check traps.

Their daughter, Mira’s youngest, was named Wana after his mother. She grew into a thin-legged girl who liked to sit close to the fire and listen rather than chase the other children. Mira brought her small treats—roasted grubs from a palm log, a honeycomb chunk wrapped in leaves—then pretended it was for everyone. Wana smiled at that, understanding it.

Mira kept one habit from childhood. When he felt angry and did not want it seen, he walked down to a specific bend in the stream where the banks held firm. He crouched there, dipped his hands, and rubbed them over his forearms until the tension eased. Kinara learned to let him go without following. After he returned, he did not apologize. He just took up a task and stayed steady.

In his mid-thirties, at age thirty-three to thirty-six, the camp organized a large hunt when fresh signs of peccary appeared along a muddy run. Mira took charge of the line without argument, placing men where they could hold and telling younger hunters when to wait. The animals broke from cover in a tight pack. Mira’s throw struck true, and the group finished the kill quickly. Back at camp he did not hoard the best cuts. He laid portions out, then made sure older people and households with few able hunters received meat first. Others repeated his decisions aloud so everyone heard them. That evening, as people ate, a man older than Mira called out his name and praised him for the hunt and the sharing. Mira grinned and took the teasing that followed, letting younger men make jokes about how he would demand the first bite forever after.

Kinara died before him, after a short illness that left her unable to stand. Mira’s camp shifted around that loss. He slept in the shelter of other kin and did not take another wife. His daughter Wana lived to seventeen, then died during a season when sickness moved through nearby camps. After that Mira’s household was a widower’s household, his bed among relatives, his tools hanging with theirs.

In the last year of his life, he remained active. He went out with younger men and came back with small game when bigger prey eluded them. Then an acute illness hit him hard. He developed severe diarrhea and vomiting and could not keep water down. Kinara’s brother and Taku—older now, visiting from Mira’s birth people—held him upright and tried to get him to swallow thin broth and clean water. Mira could not stand for long, then could not stand at all.

He died on October 19, 343, at forty-one, on the packed earth of a shared shelter with the sounds of the camp close by: insects in the dark, a baby crying, someone stirring coals for the night fire.
