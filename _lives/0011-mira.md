Mira was born on the inland edge of the coastal forests in what is now Paraíba, where small bands moved between clear streams, low ridges, and wetter ground closer to the sea. No kings ruled there. Authority sat in the camp, in elders’ arguments, in who could settle a quarrel, and in who could keep people fed. Mira’s people spoke a local language that never entered writing, and their spirits were handled through daily taboos and small acts: a pinch of food set aside, a word spoken to a place before entering it, bones placed the right way after a kill.

He came into a crowded shelter. His mother, Wana, already had two children at her side. Two related families shared the space, sleeping close, gear hung high, fires kept small. Mira was the third child; eight siblings followed in time. The older boy, Taku, started hunting early and died at twenty-six. Mira’s sisters Mira never counted on keeping all alive. One girl, Pona, died at seven. Another boy died before his first birthday. Those deaths were folded into the camp’s rules about what to touch, what to say, what to avoid.

His father was not in the shelter when Mira was small. People spoke about him without heat, as someone who had been there and then was not. Wana did not stop moving. She carried infants, set traps for small animals, and brought back bundles of fruit and roots with other women. She used dogs when the camp had them and worked without them when they were gone. She handled her own cuts and kept going when fever took her for days.

As a boy, Mira stayed close to older children and copied what they did. When the camp shifted, he carried light loads for longer than he needed to. When men repaired spears and darts, he watched. He learned the order of tasks by repetition and by being corrected. He lost things. He cut cord too short. He misread simple tracks and got laughed at. He kept returning to the same tasks until they came out right.

By his teens he moved with the men. They hunted in short bursts at dawn and late afternoon, then rested in shade. They looked for agouti and armadillo, and for the bigger animals when they could: peccary in groups, deer when they were lucky. He kept his eyes forward and took direction well. He could walk quietly for a long time. When an animal was down, he did the work that needed no talking: holding legs, cutting hide, carrying meat, laying bones aside so dogs wouldn’t scatter them.

He took part in the camp’s small rites without becoming a specialist. Before entering a dense stand of trees, he touched the trunk of a familiar tree and said a short line he had learned from older men. When an animal died by his spear, he placed certain bones together and did not step over them. When a child was sick, he kept away from some foods and avoided certain jokes. He did not explain these things. He did them because breaking the rules caused trouble.

In his early twenties, Mira shifted to a neighboring territory and joined another band through marriage. The move came with a change in daily faces and a change in whose voices carried weight. His wife, Kiri, had close kin in the camp. Mira’s place was among the in-laws, and he watched for cues before speaking in disputes. He learned new trails and new water holes. He learned where the river flooded and where it stayed clear.

Between ages twenty-four and twenty-six, he traveled with a small party between camps near the forest edge and the rivers. They slept in a shared shelter with gear piled and hung along the sides. In the morning his hunting kit was gone: his best stone-tipped spear point and the cord he trusted. No one confessed. No one searched far. People spoke sharply, then stopped. Mira borrowed what he needed. For weeks he used a spear point that sat poorly in its binding and cord that frayed too quickly. He kept hunting anyway. He spent evenings rewrapping and tightening, then redoing it again when it loosened.

He and Kiri had three children. Two boys came first, then a girl. He took the boys with him as soon as they could keep quiet, sitting them at the edge of a clearing while he checked traps. He showed them how to hold still and where to look. The older boy died at eleven during a season of sickness when many coughed and passed loose stool for days. The younger boy died at four, small and fast, a short illness. Mira did the disposal and followed the camp’s restrictions after each death without protest. The girl lived longer, learning to gather with her mother and aunts, and died at seventeen.

Mira stayed married to Kiri through those years. She kept the household tied into the camp’s web of sharing. She worked with other women, and she argued when she had to. When Mira came back empty-handed too many days in a row, she did not let him hide it. She shifted their effort toward what the land offered then: crabs and shellfish when they were nearer the coast, small animals when forest fruit was thin, tubers when the hunters’ luck ran out.

Mira’s body carried a serious injury that did not kill him. In his thirties he fell hard while moving fast through uneven ground during a chase, twisting an ankle and scraping his shin to the bone. The ankle swelled and stayed painful for weeks. The shin cut became angry and hot. An older woman cleaned it with water and crushed plant pulp. He stayed in the shelter, then hobbled near the camp, then walked slowly again. He did not speak much during that time. When he returned to full hunting, he adjusted. He avoided certain slopes. He tied his foot more tightly before long walks.

Between ages thirty-three and thirty-six, Mira led a group hunt that ended with a large peccary killed cleanly. The animal was heavy and the work of butchering took time. Back in camp, the meat drew attention from every household. Mira did not keep the best parts. He cut and handed pieces out in a clear order, sending some to older people who could not hunt and some to households that had been short on food. He took his share and stopped. People spoke his name when they ate.

Kiri died before him. Her sickness ran for days. Mira brought water, kept the fire small, and sat close enough to hand her food when she could take it. After her burial he stayed in the camp but did not keep a separate household. He slept with other kin, traded small services for food, and joined hunts when asked. He did not remarry. With no children living, he spent time with nieces and nephews, carrying infants when asked and sharpening points for young men who talked too much.

In October of his forty-first year, a fast illness moved through the camp. Several people fell sick within days. Mira developed severe diarrhea and vomiting and could not keep water down. His mouth cracked and his skin dried. People tried to give him thin broth and chewed plant mash. He could not swallow enough. He became confused, tried to stand, and collapsed. He died in the shelter on October 19, 343 AD. The camp followed its rules for handling the body and shifted away from the site soon after.
