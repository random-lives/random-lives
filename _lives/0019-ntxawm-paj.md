Ntxawm Paj was born on September 21, 1653, in a Miao village in the hills north of Zunyi, where steep fields cut into red soil and forest. Qing rule reached the area through the county yamen, tax registers, and patrols on the roads. In the village, the old ways set the calendar: offerings at the hearth, words spoken to ancestors, and calls for a ritual specialist when sickness or misfortune would not lift.

She entered a stem household. Her father, Nplooj Yaj, farmed mixed plots—millet and beans on higher ground, a little rice where water held, and tubers that carried the family through thin months. Nplooj’s widowed mother, Ma Huab, ran the inner order of the house. Ma Huab controlled the grain basket and the keys, decided which jar of salt could be opened, and kept the fire alive even when rain came down for days. Ntxawm Paj learned early to listen for the scrape of Ma Huab’s ladle against the pot and to read what it meant. Quiet morning. Or trouble.

There were nine children in the household, and Ntxawm Paj was the second. Boys came first in the list of expectations. Her older brother, Tswb Vwj, stayed close to their father and learned the boundary stones and the names of the ridges. A younger brother died at eight, another died before he could sit up, and two sisters died before they were weaned. The deaths did not stop the work. The family buried the small bodies on a slope above the fields and returned to planting. Ntxawm Paj kept track of which days were for food offerings and which days were for field labor. She watched her mother’s hands, copied the twists of fiber, and learned to cut grasses for pig feed with a blade that needed sharpening every few days.

By the time she was a teenager, more Han families moved along the valleys and market corridors. New plots were opened, and old claims were argued over. Some of the men in her village began to speak more Southwestern Mandarin in the market town. Ntxawm Paj learned it in pieces—prices, weights, the names of cloth and iron tools—first by listening, then by answering. She did not read, and she did not pretend to. She carried eggs and bundles of greens to exchange for salt. She remembered what each merchant cheated on and which ones kept their measures true. When she was worried, she checked her basket again and again before leaving home, then checked it again at the bend in the path.

She married into a slightly better-off household in her late teens. Her husband, Liaj Ntxhib, farmed land that lay closer to a track used by carriers and tax runners. The household had more pots, better iron, and a pig pen built with heavier timbers. It was still an extended house under an older male relative’s authority, and the elders watched what she did. On her first winter there she learned where they stored millet in sealed jars and where they kept the good cloth for festivals. She offered at the hearth each morning, touched the ground with her fingertips, and spoke the names of the dead in a low voice. The practice did not change with marriage; the ancestors did.

Children followed quickly. Her first was a boy, Yaj, and he lived. The second was a girl who died at birth, her skin already cold and blue-gray. Ntxawm Paj washed the child herself and insisted on the right words to send her, even when the elder women pushed her to move on. A third child, Lis, lived into adulthood. A fourth, another boy, died at two during a season of diarrhea that ran through several households. She bore three more, and they lived: a daughter, Vwj, and two sons, Xeem and Tswb. She fed them all with rice gruel stretched thin, sweet potato when the bins went low, and salted greens when meat ran out.

When Qing officials tightened their registers and pressed for labor and transport, men in the area were called to carry loads and work on roads. Some did not return on schedule. Grain moved out of the valleys, and prices rose. Ntxawm Paj listened to talk at the market: rumors of campaigns against upland groups, talk of weapons being seized, and talk of villages pushed to move. She stored more dried tuber than Ma Huab would have approved. She hid it in a clay jar behind stacked firewood and told only her daughter where it was.

In her late twenties, a lean season hit after bad weather damaged the upland plots. The household rationed grain, and the elders counted bowls. One evening, after she argued with Liaj Ntxhib about how much millet could be taken from storage for a sick child, the dispute turned into shouting in the main room. Liaj struck her repeatedly with open hand and then with a fist. She fell against the corner of the grain chest. An elder sat on the bench and watched without rising. Ntxawm Paj slept that night on the far side of the hearth with her arms wrapped around her ribs. In the morning she tied her hair, lifted water as usual, and walked out to the fields with bruises showing through her sleeves. She avoided the main room for days and spoke to Liaj only when the children were close enough to hear.

She kept one friendship that belonged to her alone. A woman from a nearby hamlet, Huab Ntxawm, met her at the path where carriers rested. Huab liked to joke about merchants and their lies, and she laughed loudly in a way that made men turn their heads. Ntxawm Paj did not laugh as loudly, but she stayed for the stories. They traded small things—needle, thread, a strip of cloth dyed darker than the usual—while their children chased each other in the dust. When Ntxawm Paj’s worry tightened her throat, she walked to that path and waited. If Huab was there, she spoke more easily.

In her mid-thirties, the fevers began. They came with warm months and wet air. She shivered even when the sun was strong, then sweated through her clothes at night. The shaking left her weak. She still went to the fields, but she stopped taking the far plots on steep ground. She shifted to weeding near the house, feeding pigs, and processing grain. When the chills hit, she sat by the hearth and pressed her hands to her thighs to stop the trembling. The household called a ritual specialist more than once. Chickens were offered; words were chanted. The fevers returned anyway. She learned which work could wait and which could not. She avoided long trips to the market unless salt had run out.

Her sons reached adulthood. Yaj married and had children before he died at fifty-three. Xeem and Tswb became men who could carry heavy loads, speak enough Mandarin to bargain, and deal with officials without panicking. Her daughter Vwj lived long and strong and outlived everyone. Ntxawm Paj took pride in Vwj’s steady hands when she cut greens and in the way Vwj kept children quiet during rituals.

As the years passed, the household arrangement shifted. Some land was lost after a dispute with newcomers who claimed a ridge line; the argument went through intermediaries and ended in a decision that favored the people with better ties to the market town. Another year, too much rain loosened a slope and sent mud into a lower plot. Ntxawm Paj’s husband remained alive, but the household no longer stood on its own. They lived under the roof and authority of an older male relative, an uncle who controlled decisions and work assignments. Ntxawm Paj kept her eyes down in meetings and saved her strength for the tasks she could still do.

In the spring of 1712, an epidemic fever moved through the area. It struck quickly. Ntxawm Paj’s body already knew the pattern of chills, but this time it did not break. On April 30, 1712, she died at home, on the sleeping platform near the hearth, while the household prepared more water and argued over which offerings to make first. Her husband lived on under his uncle’s roof.
