#   timing: childhood through adulthood (1650s–1700s)
# - event: Periodic Miao/indigenous unrest and Qing suppression in Guizhou (campaigns,

#   timing: intermittent, especially 1680s–1710s

#   reasoning: For an ordinary rural married woman, violence from a husband or other
#     household member (including in-law conflict) is the most common violence exposure;
#     dependence on the marital household and limited recourse raise lifetime probability.

#     household work.
#   reasoning: High lifetime exposure to parasites, respiratory infections, malaria-like
#     fevers, and nutritional stress makes some chronic limiting condition very plausible
#     by midlife, especially for someone surviving to 58.

Ntxawm Paj was born on September 21, 1653, in a Miao-speaking village on the uplands north of the Guizhou plateau, near the market routes that ran toward Zunyi. The Qing ruled the province through county yamen in the towns and through a web of local intermediaries, and Miao villages sat inside that system without belonging to it on equal terms. Men went down to markets to buy salt and iron and to answer demands for labor. Women kept fields, firewood, and children moving.

She was the second child in a house that kept filling. Her mother gave birth nine times. Eight siblings arrived after Ntxawm Paj, and death came through the gaps in the births. A brother died at eight. Two siblings died at birth or soon after. Another sister died at one. The older brothers who lived into adulthood carried loads down to market and brought back cloth, needles, and news from the road.

Her father worked the slopes and the flatter plots by the stream. He planted mixed crops suited to the hills: grains where the soil held, tubers where it did not, and whatever could survive the wet summers and cold snaps. The household was a stem family. Her father’s widowed mother lived under the same roof, stiff-legged and sharp-tongued, still able to mind a cooking pot and keep track of stores. Ntxawm Paj learned early to answer without hesitation when she was called, and to keep food from being wasted. When a pot boiled over or a child spilled grain, the old woman’s voice cut through the house.

When she was a girl, Qing officials pushed deeper into the countryside. Clerks and runners appeared with registers. They asked questions in Chinese and accepted answers through intermediaries. Men in the village practiced the Chinese they needed for bargaining and for keeping trouble away from their door. Ntxawm Paj listened and copied sounds while she carried bundles and watched smaller children. By the time she was grown she could speak her own language at home and enough Southwestern Mandarin to buy salt, understand prices, and follow the orders barked by yamen men on the road.

In her teens, more Han families appeared in the valleys and along the better paths. Some came as tenants under local patrons. Others cleared land and built new houses. The markets expanded. More cloth was for sale, and more iron tools, but land pressure tightened. Boundaries mattered more. A patch of hillside that once fed pigs and supplied firewood could become a disputed line.

She married into a household slightly better off than the one she was born into. Her husband was named Yang Sheng. His family held more good plots near water and had a steady place at the market. They lived with his kin, not as a separate couple. An older male relative acted as household head, and decisions about grain stores and labor went through him. The house spoke Miao at home. In the yard and at market Yang Sheng used Mandarin when he needed it, and so did she.

She rose before dawn. She blew on coals, warmed water, and pushed the older children into motion. She carried loads to the fields, planted, weeded, and cut. She fed pigs and chickens. When the household head called for someone to go down to market, she went with other women, a baby on her back and a basket on her arm. She watched scales and counted small coin by touch, then checked again. When she got home she hid a little salt in a jar where children could not reach it.

The lean seasons arrived with the cold. In one of those years, when she was in her late twenties or early thirties, the household’s grain ran short and arguments got loud. The older kin demanded a stricter ration. Ntxawm Paj insisted on keeping more for the children and refused to accept accusations that she had wasted stores. Yang Sheng struck her in the room off the main hearth. He hit her again when she tried to speak. An elder in-law stood in the doorway and watched without stepping in. The next morning she wrapped cloth tight around her ribs, tied her hair back, and went to the fields. She bent and hoed on bruised legs. No one offered to take her place.

She gave birth seven times. The first child was a boy, Wei. A daughter came next and died at birth. Another girl, Lan, lived into her twenties. A second son died at two. A daughter, Mei, lived long and outlived her mother. Two more sons, Jun and Bao, grew to manhood. Ntxawm Paj nursed and weaned, buried small bodies, and then cooked for the living. When a child cried at night she woke quickly and could not return to sleep. She checked the latch and listened to the wind and to footsteps outside the door.

When unrest flared in parts of Guizhou, talk reached the village fast. Men returning from market described arrests, weapons taken, and new restrictions. Some villages farther off were forced to move or to submit to closer oversight. Patrols passed on the roads. People hid spears and old matchlocks. A few young men left for weeks and came back silent. Ntxawm Paj kept her children close and watched strangers carefully. When yamen men asked questions in Mandarin, she answered in short phrases and did not volunteer names.

Rain failed one year and then returned in heavy bursts. Streams dropped low, then cut into the paths. Fields on the slope dried, and the plants came up thin. When sudden rains hit, soil slid and buried seedlings. Grain prices at market rose. The household stretched porridge with roots and greens. Ntxawm Paj boiled bitter leaves, added salt only when children refused to eat, and set aside a handful of grain for seed even when mouths were hungry.

In her mid-thirties, the fevers began. They came with the warm months. One day she shivered under a quilt at noon, teeth clicking, and the next day she sweated through her shirt and could not stand without holding a post. After each bout she returned to work too early. The pattern repeated. Over years she carried less and moved slower. She stopped going far up the steepest plots. She took on tasks closer to the house: sorting seed, chopping feed, tending small children, and preparing food for field workers. On better days she still went out to weed in the nearer fields, her hands steady but her legs weak.

Her sons married. Daughters-in-law entered the household and brought their own ties and grievances. Ntxawm Paj managed them with sharp instructions and quick corrections. She watched stores closely and argued when she thought grain was being taken too freely. In the end she did not die under her own roof. While her husband still lived, she spent her last period in a kin household under another male head, a practical arrangement made when her fevers and weakness made her harder to support in a crowded home.

In the spring of 1712, an epidemic fever moved through the area. People spoke of villages where many were sick at once. Ntxawm Paj caught it at fifty-eight. She shook with chills, then lay drenched in sweat, unable to keep down thin porridge or water. On April 30, 1712, in a room that smelled of smoke and sour cloth, she died with her husband living and her grown children spread between households.
