#     death_age: 1
#     death_year: 1927
#     name: Tomás

#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1930
#     death_age: 71
#     death_year: 2001
#     name: Elena
#     narrative_role: Older sister close in age; confidante in adolescence and early

#   - birth_year: 1933
#     death_age: 58
#     death_year: 1991
#     name: María Guadalupe

#   - birth_year: 1935
#     death_age: 81
#     death_year: 2016
#     name: Leticia
#     narrative_role: Younger sister; playful rival in childhood, later a practical
#       helper. She is the one who brings groceries/medicine during María Guadalupe’s
#       later diabetic crises.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: School progress is uneven; marital arguments often center on money
#       management and ‘disorder’; inconsistent diabetes management contributes to complications.
#     scene: Missed school assignments and forgotten chores lead to conflict; as an
#       adult, she misplaces bills/receipts, delays clinic visits, and starts household
#       projects (cleaning, sewing, organizing) without finishing.
#     timing: Visible from ages 6–13; recurs strongly in adulthood, especially 30s–50s
#     trait: Very low conscientiousness (4th percentile)
#   - consequence: Builds strong neighborhood/parish ties; also increases tolerance
#       of mistreatment and tendency to return after violence.
#     scene: She smooths fights between siblings and later between husband and children;
#       in parish work she recruits helpers by asking gently and giving credit to others.
#     timing: Adolescence through late adulthood
#     trait: High agreeableness (68th percentile)
#   - consequence: Provides calm in the household and caregiving; but delays seeking
#       help and can normalize unacceptable behavior (including violence) longer than
#       she should.
#     scene: Even in crises she tends to act steady and practical—making food, arranging
#       rides, praying—rather than spiraling into panic; she downplays her own symptoms
#       until they are serious.
#     timing: Throughout adulthood, especially during 1961 child loss and 1980s illness
#     trait: Low neuroticism (17th percentile)
#   - consequence: Limits educational/clerical opportunities; increases dependence on
#       family for navigating healthcare and finances.
#     scene: Struggles with paperwork, formal bureaucracy, and understanding medical
#       instructions; relies on daughter or parish contacts to interpret forms and clinic
#       directions.
#     timing: School years and again in 1980s medical management
#     trait: Below-average intelligence (18th percentile)
#   - consequence: Supports her community-organizing role and willingness to engage
#       with changing city life without becoming politically radical.
#     scene: Enjoys radio programs/music, tries new recipes, and is curious about English
#       phrases or new consumer goods, but prefers familiar routines and parish norms.
#     timing: 20s–40s
#     trait: Moderate openness (60th percentile)
# number_of_children: '4'
# number_of_siblings: '7'
# occupation: Homemaker/household manager (primary role; unpaid domestic labor, may
#   do occasional side earnings)
# religion: 'Catholic practice: regular Mass attendance (often weekly or near-weekly),
#   confession occasionally; devotions (rosary/novena), participates in parish events'

# structured_incidents:
# - event: 'Recurring pattern: on more than one occasion her household was hit by petty
#     theft—once a break-in through a window/breezeway that took a radio and some jewelry,
#     and other times pickpocketing/market scams when she was running errands in central
#     Monterrey.'
#   reasoning: Living an urban life in Monterrey across decades makes exposure to theft/burglary/pickpocketing
#     or fraud fairly likely at least once, even for a middle-class household.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: late 1960s–mid 1980s (approx. ages 35–52)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: 'Sustained period: she became known in her parish and neighborhood as a reliable
#     organizer, leading a women’s committee that coordinated food/collections and helped
#     fundraise for a parish improvement project, earning public thanks from the priest
#     and community.'
#   reasoning: Most people have no widely notable achievements, but upward mobility
#     into a solid middle-class household suggests some success (e.g., respected community
#     role, children’s educational success, running an effective household) that might
#     be locally recognized.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: mid 1970s–early 1980s (approx. ages 42–50)
#   type: major_achievement
# - event: 'Recurring pattern: as one of eight children in a strained working-class
#     household, she was frequently beaten with a belt or switch for mistakes and was
#     sometimes kept home from play or school to do chores, with episodes severe enough
#     to leave bruises.'
#   reasoning: Working-class large families in 1930s–40s urban Mexico had higher stress
#     and corporal punishment was common; severe physical abuse/neglect is a minority
#     but not rare.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: childhood, approx. ages 6–13 (1939–1946)
#   type: childhood_abuse
# - event: 'Recurring pattern: during marital conflicts—often tied to money stress and
#     her husband’s temper—he occasionally slapped or shoved her and once threw household
#     objects, after which she would stay with a relative for a night or two before
#     returning.'
#   reasoning: Intimate partner violence had significant prevalence in mid–late 20th
#     century Mexico, and long marriage duration increases cumulative risk.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: most intense in the late 1970s–mid 1980s (approx. ages 45–52)
#   type: domestic_violence
# - event: 'Sustained period: she lived for years with type 2 diabetes requiring clinic
#     visits and diet/medication changes; she experienced recurring infections and numbness
#     in her feet and was periodically laid up for days after poorly controlled blood
#     sugar episodes.'
#   reasoning: Given confirmed diabetes-related death, she very likely lived with diabetes
#     and/or related chronic conditions for years before the terminal complications.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: approx. ages 45–58 (1978–1991)
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: 'Sustained period: she became the main day-to-day caregiver for an aging
#     parent living nearby—handling cooking, bathing help, medications, and doctor visits—while
#     coordinating with siblings for occasional respite.'
#   reasoning: With many siblings she might share responsibilities, but it was still
#     common for daughters to provide substantial hands-on care to aging parents/in-laws.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late 1970s–late 1980s (approx. ages 46–56)

María Guadalupe Ramírez Garza was born on January 14, 1933, in Monterrey, Nuevo León, when the city ran under the authority of the post-Revolution Mexican state and the PRI’s growing political machine. Her family spoke Spanish at home, went to Mass, and kept a small religious corner with a crucifix and an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, a candle stub, and a rosary looped over a nail.

She entered a crowded household with older siblings already grown or nearly grown. Ricardo, Ernesto, and Javier were men in their teens and early twenties by the time she began to remember them: boots by the door, the smell of sweat and machine oil, work talk at the table. Rogelio was closer but still much older, with the impatience of someone who believed effort fixed most things. Elena, born in 1930, became her nearest ally, the one who could translate the shifting moods of their parents. Leticia arrived two years after María Guadalupe and grew into a rival for attention, quick to hide a toy or mock a hairstyle, then quick to share candy when nobody watched.

Their father, José Ramírez, earned a steadier wage than many men in the neighborhood because he had a trade and kept it; he repaired and installed, came home with scraped knuckles, and expected quiet when he sat down. Their mother, Carmen Garza, sold and helped sell—small retail work that meant long hours standing, bargaining, and counting coins before returning home to a second shift of cooking and washing. Carmen ran the home with lists in her head and impatience in her voice. When a job of cleaning or fetching water went undone, she reached for a belt. When José found out a task had been missed, he brought a switch. The punishments landed often between 1939 and 1946, when María Guadalupe was six to thirteen. She learned to anticipate anger and to move quickly when someone barked her name, yet she still forgot. She left a pot too long, lost a key, arrived late from an errand. The bruises came, then the demand that she scrub floors or watch Leticia instead of playing.

School gave her something she could hold onto: words on paper. She learned to read and to write in Spanish well enough to leave notes and copy prayers, and she picked up a little English—simple phrases from lessons and from hearing it in stores and at the edge of radio broadcasts. She did not keep up with assignments. Teachers sent notes home that she hid or misplaced. Carmen took her out of class for chores more than once, and María Guadalupe never caught up.

She found steadiness at church. Abuela Petra, her mother’s mother, sometimes appeared in the doorway with a bundle of herbs or a sack of fruit, and she was the adult who put a hand between María Guadalupe and a raised belt. Petra taught her a novena and how to hold the rosary beads between thumb and forefinger. When Petra died in 1952, the house felt louder and less protected. María Guadalupe turned to Elena more, whispering in bed after the lights went out, making each other laugh by imitating their brothers’ serious voices.

At eighteen she began spending more time in parish activities and neighborhood errands, and she met Héctor Salinas in 1951. He courted with patience and public respectability: walking her home, meeting her family, showing up on Sundays. They married in the early 1950s in the Catholic church. María Guadalupe liked setting up her own kitchen, even if it stayed messy. She enjoyed turning the radio on while she worked and lingering over sweet bread and coffee in the afternoon.

Children came quickly. Patricia was born in 1954, Adriana in 1956, Miguel in 1959, and Raúl in 1962. María Guadalupe stayed home as the primary homemaker, taking pride in feeding everyone and keeping the children clean for Mass, even when she lost track of laundry or let bills slide under a folded cloth on the table. Héctor’s earnings rose over the years as Monterrey expanded its factories and services, and their household moved into a more solid middle-class routine—better appliances, sturdier furniture, more dependable groceries—without María Guadalupe ever feeling fully in control of schedules and paperwork.

In 1961 Patricia died at seven. After the funeral María Guadalupe returned to the small acts that gave her order: lighting a candle before the Virgin’s image, saying the rosary more nights than not, walking to church when her head filled with noise. She grew more protective of the remaining children, sometimes too sharp with them when they ran ahead in the street or stayed out after dark.

By the late 1960s she spent more time in the center of Monterrey, shopping and running errands, and the city’s petty crimes touched her. In 1969 a hand lifted her purse on a crowded street while she was distracted by a vendor’s talk. She came home angry, embarrassed, and she scolded the children for being noisy even though they were not with her. The following years brought a new caution. She told Adriana to hold her bag tight and keep coins tucked away. She also grew quieter about politics after 1968; Héctor shut down conversations when they drifted toward protests or police, and she learned to change the subject.

She liked the company of women more than sitting through her brothers’ talk of work and grudges. Doña Lupita Sánchez, a neighbor, made her laugh with blunt jokes and gossip about television actors. They traded recipes and shared small pleasures: a new kind of sweet, a fresh batch of tortillas, sitting outside in the evening to catch a bit of air. María Guadalupe kept going to Mass regularly. Confession happened when Lent came or when a worry grew heavy enough.

In 1976 Padre Ignacio asked her to help organize collections for a parish project. She said yes, then lost the first notebook where she wrote names and amounts. Lupita teased her and bought her a new one. María Guadalupe learned to lean on others for the details: someone else held the cash box, someone else copied totals neatly. She did what she did best—asking, persuading, remembering who needed a visit, bringing people in with warmth. By 1980 the committee raised enough for improvements, and Padre Ignacio thanked them publicly after Mass. María Guadalupe stood with other women near the front, her hair carefully set, and accepted the praise with a small smile and quick glances toward Héctor.

The midlife years carried strain too. Héctor’s temper sharpened when money was tight, and the late 1970s brought conflicts about spending, mess, and the demands of children becoming adults. In 1978, after an argument about household expenses, he slapped her and shoved her against a door. She took a small bag and spent two nights at Elena’s home. Elena fed her, asked pointed questions, and then, with the same practicality that had sustained them as girls, helped arrange a return that saved face. The violence returned in 1983 during a worse stretch of money worries; Héctor threw objects in the kitchen, and María Guadalupe left again for a short stay with family.

Her parents aged into frailty as she moved into her forties. José died in 1979, and the siblings met around funeral duties and decisions. Carmen’s health declined afterward, and María Guadalupe became the one who showed up each day. From 1979 through 1986 she managed bathing, medicines, cooking, and doctor visits, calling Javier or Rogelio for transport or small repairs, coordinating with Elena and Leticia for brief relief. She kept a small stack of clinic papers in her bag and often could not find the right one when asked. Adriana helped her fill forms, and Miguel drove when he could.

In 1978 she received a diabetes diagnosis. She listened to instructions at the clinic and nodded, then mixed them up at home. Some weeks she followed the diet strictly; other weeks she forgot, ate what was easy, and skipped medicine until she felt sick. In the 1980s she developed numbness in her feet and recurring infections. Enfermera Teresa explained things again and again: meals, pills, check-ups. María Guadalupe found comfort in routine prayer and in keeping the household moving, even when she spent whole days laid up.

A break-in hit their home in 1977, through a window or breezeway, and a radio and small jewelry disappeared. Héctor was furious. Rogelio fixed the latch. The fear stayed longer than the loss, and María Guadalupe double-checked doors for a while, then fell back into old habits of forgetting.

The 1982 debt crisis and inflation tightened budgets across Monterrey. Prices jumped. Héctor complained about costs, and arguments flared, though the worst violence did not return after 1985. The Mexico City earthquake that year brought new charity drives through the church. María Guadalupe helped gather canned goods and clothing, folding shirts on parish tables and recording names as best she could, relying on Lupita to correct her lists.

Carmen died in 1986. After that, María Guadalupe’s caregiving shifted to her own body. By 1990 her feet hurt and tingled, and infections came back quickly. She still lived with Héctor and at least one unmarried child in the household, still attended Mass when she could, still lit a candle at home and said the rosary in the evenings.

On July 3, 1991, she died in Monterrey from diabetes complications. Her family held a Catholic wake and funeral Mass, and her body was buried in a local cemetery after prayers over the coffin and a final rosary said by women from her parish committee.
