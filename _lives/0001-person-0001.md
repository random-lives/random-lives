Koi was called that from his mother’s people because it was short and carried in the open air. He was born in the high country where cloud sat low on ridges and the ground stayed wet underfoot. The hamlet was a day’s walk from the warmer rivers below. Nights could turn cold in the dry months. Smoke clung to the walls and rafters. Forest pressed close, and the gardens were cuts in it—cleared, fenced, weeded, then abandoned when the soil thinned or a slope moved.

No one set words down. When something had to be remembered, people made others hear it. They repeated who handed over a pig and who took it. They listed witnesses by name until everyone in earshot could say the same story.

His parents held an ordinary place: a few pigs, gardens that fed the house, kin close enough to help and close enough to quarrel with. His father worked taro and other roots in mounds and kept pigs behind stakes, letting them out only when someone could watch them. His mother did the daily work without pause—planting, pulling greens, cooking, hauling water and firewood, carrying pig feed in bundles of leaves.

Koi was the fifth of ten children. Two brothers died before they walked, and another died soon after. The dead were wrapped and carried off; then people went back to cutting, digging, and cooking. Koi learned to keep his questions to himself because questions only brought anger or silence.

He grew into a boy who did not fit the small courtesies that held people together. He did not greet elders with warmth unless his mother pushed him forward. He avoided games and wrestling, not from fear but from disinterest. When older boys mocked him, he stared through them as if they were trees. People read it as arrogance. His mother corrected him in front of others—hand on his shoulder, a sharp whisper—and he obeyed with a flat face that made the obedience feel like insult.

When he was about ten, the rains came hard and stayed. The footpaths turned to long strips of slick clay. In an upper garden the earth let go. A bank slid and carried young taro down into a tangle of mud and broken stems. At first light his father walked the edge and said nothing, then turned away with his jaw set. The household shifted to a lower plot and worked for days cutting drains, setting stones, and rebuilding fences with wet hands.

Koi watched the slope more than the plants. He began to place his feet like an old man. He learned which roots shone when they were slick and which patches of clay looked firm but peeled away. Other boys ran and fell and laughed. Koi did not laugh when they fell. He watched and stored it.

A few seasons later a sickness moved through pigs in the valley. It started with coughing and wet discharge and then a slow collapse. A sow meant for an exchange stood with her head down and stopped eating. Men argued about who had brought it. In the men’s shelter at night Koi’s father named a visiting group from over the ridge and spoke as if naming them could fix the loss. Two pigs died in Koi’s yard.

The loss bit into more than food. Pigs were the lever for almost everything—marriage help, repairs after a fight, the payments that cooled a dispute. With fewer pigs, Koi’s father had less to promise and less to threaten with. He rationed more sharply. He snapped when the pot emptied too early. His mother spent longer in the gardens and came back with smaller bundles to stretch the stores.

After a run of bad luck—poor hunting, pig deaths, a man falling twice on the same path—people tightened their rules. They lowered their voices near certain places. They kept away from a bend in the stream where an old stump stood, dark with moss. Men placed cooked food and leaves there and spoke to the spirits of the place and to ancestors by name, asking for the ground to hold and the animals to breathe clean.

Koi followed every taboo exactly. He did it without complaint and without belief showing on his face. What he refused was the talk after: who had offended whom, which kin line had stirred up trouble, who should pay. When people argued, he listened as if counting. He did not offer comfort. He waited for mistakes.

His own tongue was not used far beyond nearby ridges. But the valley was tied to others through marriage and exchange, and Koi learned enough of a neighboring language to follow disputes and bargains. He did not learn it through charm. He learned it by watching and by keeping quiet until he could repeat a phrase back without changing it.

As a young man, older men began to bring him along when they expected trouble. They did not ask him to persuade anyone. They used him to repeat what had been said and to catch a lie. Koi liked that work. When a man’s story slipped, Koi’s eyes narrowed in a way that made people uncomfortable.

In his early twenties he moved into a nearby valley and married. The move was not a journey to a new world. It was a shift of paths and names—new gardens, new kin obligations, new men who watched him.

Soon after, a boundary dispute flared with a neighbor. It began with a pig rooting into a garden and snapping stems. The garden owner demanded payment. Koi said the man had cut a gap in the fence to set him up. The man denied it in a loud voice that drew others. The argument spread from the pig to the ground itself: who first cleared the edge, which grandfather planted the first taro there, which line had rights to the trees.

An older mediator came and sat them down where others could hear. Koi could have ended it quickly with a small compensation and the right words. He refused. He stood stiff with his arms folded and kept his face hard. When the other man mixed up a place name in Koi’s language, Koi gave a short laugh. It was sharp and ugly. People hissed at him to stop. The mediator’s eyes turned cold.

The settlement came anyway. Koi paid a pig and food bundles because he was ordered to, not because he yielded. He delivered the payment quickly, which stopped the dispute from turning into blows. But it left him marked. Men greeted him with less ease. Visits to his house thinned. His wife stopped trying to pull him toward other women’s fires. Their house stayed a couple’s house, childless, and people looked at the empty space around them as if it were a statement.

Koi did not soften to fix it. He worked.

He worked with care that was not kindness. He set fence posts deeper than most. He cut drains before the clouds broke. He stored pig feed under cover instead of trusting the weather. He watched his pigs closely and counted them often. He did not give extra meat or extra help just to keep things smooth. When someone asked for a favor, he asked what would come back.

A big gathering came—an exchange and reconciliation where pigs were led forward with leaves tied on them and men recited obligations in long chains, naming what had been given and what was still owed. Koi stayed out of the center. He moved along the edge carrying water, listening, translating short statements when asked.

When a visitor tried to claim a debt had been paid, Koi corrected him in the visitor’s own language in front of everyone. He did it without tact, without giving the man a way to step back. The visitor’s face tightened and his shoulders rose. Later Koi’s wife told him, quietly, that he was building enemies for nothing. Koi said nothing back. His silence was not peace; it was refusal.

The next wet season a flash flood tore out part of a creek crossing. Logs shifted. The bank was chewed open. Travel slowed because the safer routes took longer and the faster routes took falls. Koi took the higher path and made others follow it when they walked with him. If someone complained, he did not argue. He kept going at his pace, forcing the group to match him.

Near the end of the dry months in his twenty-seventh year, after several clearer days, Koi went upslope with two men to open a new garden patch. The ground still held moisture under the leaf litter. They cut back regrowth from an old clearing and dragged it into piles. At the edge stood a thicker tree.

Koi took a stone-bladed adze, its head ground smooth and lashed tight to the handle with fiber. He worked a notch with steady rhythm, pausing to look up and judge the lean. He listened for the change in sound as the wood began to split.

A gust came up the slope. The tree shifted early. Koi stepped back, but his foot slid on wet clay. He went down hard, and the trunk swung into him before he could roll clear. It struck across his upper body and pinned him. The air left him.

The men heaved and cut and got the trunk off him. They dragged him down the track on a mat of leaves. His wife met them near the first houses with her hair loose and mud on her hands. Koi’s eyes were open. He stared up at the canopy and did not speak.

By the time they reached his house, the small one he had built with his own hands, his chest no longer moved. The adze lay where it had been dropped, half sunk in soft ground at the edge of the new clearing.
