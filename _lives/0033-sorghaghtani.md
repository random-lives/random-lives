Sorghaghtani was born on December 26, 1283, in a felt ger set on the open grassland of what is now eastern Inner Mongolia, under the rule of the Yuan, the Mongol empire’s dynasty in China. Her parents spoke Mongolic and lived as free common herders owing taxes and service to local nobles. Their camp stood near a shallow stream and winter wells, far from towns, among other households that moved with their animals.

Her father, Borochu, spent the dark months cutting frozen dung for fuel, checking the sheepfold, and riding out to find strays when wind erased tracks. When he returned he brought gossip from other camps and counted lambs by touch in the cramped pen. Her mother, Altani, kept the hearth, milked ewes when the weather eased, and stored curds in skin bags hung from the ger frame. She carried Sorghaghtani in her deel while she worked, then laid her in a cradle board propped near the warm side of the tent.

In the spring of 1285 the family moved to better grazing. Altani splashed the first milk of the season to the sky and flicked drops toward the ground before pouring the rest into a pot. Sorghaghtani crawled in the dust near the tethered goats and put her hands in everything.

In September 1285, after a spell of stomach sickness in the camp, Sorghaghtani developed severe diarrhea. Altani boiled water and gave her thin whey. Borochu rode for a shaman from a neighboring group, but the child died on September 16, 1285.
