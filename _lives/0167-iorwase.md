# ethnicity: Tiv-speaking (Benue valley agriculturalist communities)
# father_occupation: Subsistence farmer (mixed cropping; household food production with
#   some local market exchange)
# historical_context:
# - event: Creation and consolidation of colonial administration in Northern Nigeria
#     (Native Authority structures, new legal regimes, census/records, and the growing
#     reach of colonial policing)
#   timing: late adulthood, roughly ages 60–75 (1900–1915)
# - event: Rainfall variability in the Guinea savanna causing one or more poor-yield
#     years (localized drought, late rains, or flood damage affecting yams and other
#     staples, with temporary food-price spikes)
#   timing: intermittent across life; most consequential in prime farming years, ages
#     20–60 (1860–1900)
# - event: The 1918–1919 influenza pandemic (global 'Spanish flu') reaching Nigeria
#     and causing community-wide sickness, labor disruption, and elevated mortality
#   timing: very late life, ages 78–79 (1918–1919)
# household_social_status: Ordinary free household (typical subsistence farmers; average
#   standing in the lineage/community)
# household_structure_at_birth: 'Patrilocal compound: father alive, mother alive, monogamous
#   union (nuclear core within a larger patrilineal homestead)'

# mother_occupation: Food processing + cooking + childcare, plus substantial farm labor
#   (typical rural mother’s work)
# narrative_plan:
#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: 1888
#     name: Terdoo
#     narrative_role: Subsistence farmer and lineage man; steady, demanding about work
#       but affectionate in his own way. Teaches Iorwase fieldcraft and public speaking
#       at meetings; dies when Iorwase is established, leaving him to inherit responsibilities.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: 1898
#     name: Mnguhemba
#     narrative_role: Food processing, childcare, and farm labor; strongly protective

#     role: mother
#   - death_year: 1892
#     name: Gbaahemba

#       his death.
#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 33
#     connection: Occurs during prime farming years after household expansion; reinforces
#       his low honesty-humility suspicion of others and pushes him into public accusation/negotiation
#       at market-day.
#     incident: victim_property_crime (yam theft from edge of plots; confrontation at
#       market meeting)
#   - age: 39
#     connection: Links to broader insecurity and travel risk; becomes a personal justification
#       for carrying protective medicines and for later readiness to strike first when
#       insulted.
#     incident: physical_assault (ambushed returning from market; broken teeth; weeks
#       of recovery)
#   - age: 41
#     connection: Escalates from earlier theft suspicions and simmering inter-compound
#       tensions; resolution through elders demonstrates his ability to re-enter community
#       standing after violence.
#     incident: physical_assault_perp (beer-gathering quarrel; strikes man with hoe
#       handle; compensation demanded)
#   - age: 53
#     connection: Builds on decades of visible sociability, negotiation skill, and medicine/divination
#       practice; solidifies his adult social prominence and reduces future violence
#       around him by making him a go-to mediator.
#     incident: major_achievement (arbitrates land-boundary dispute accepted without
#       renewed fighting)
#   - age: 58
#     connection: Transforms his daily routine and household power-sharing; increases
#       reliance on adult children, and makes his public authority more about speech/ritual
#       than physical work.
#     incident: chronic_illness (recurrent fever/chills limiting labor; shifts role
#       to adviser/medicine preparation)
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-7
#     key_events:
#     - Raised in a patrilocal compound during a period of local insecurity; adults
#       emphasize taboos and protective medicines after multiple infant deaths in the
#       family.
#     - Learns farm routines by following older siblings; begins showing very high extraversion—eager
#       to accompany adults to gatherings and markets.
#     - Hears repeated household stories about infant-loss and protection, shaping his
#       later interest in medicines.
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 8-20
#     key_events:
#     - Older sister Mbayange dies (1856), intensifying the household’s reliance on
#       healers and ritual protections.
#     - As a teen, begins assisting in farm leadership tasks; develops a reputation
#       for being friendly and persuasive but also for sharp bargaining (low honesty-humility).
#     - First experiences of regional conflict pressures (raids/armed patrols), shaping
#       vigilance during travel.
#     phase: Later childhood and adolescence
#   - age_range: 21-40
#     key_events:
#     - Marries Mbaor around 1862; establishes his own fields while still embedded in
#       the wider compound.
#     - Children born 1863–1876; death of firstborn son in 1878 becomes a turning point
#       toward more intensive medicine/divination practice.
#     - Local relocation within Tivland in this period (late 1870s–early 1880s) driven
#       by land access and security considerations; maintains kin ties.
#     phase: Early adulthood (marriage, farming expansion)
#   - age_range: 41-60
#     key_events:
#     - After being assaulted on the road (1879), becomes more vigilant and more willing
#       to use force in disputes, while still presenting as agreeable in public.
#     - Engages in at least one serious fight at a beer gathering (1881–1882) leading
#       to customary compensation; learns how to manage conflict without permanent rupture.
#     - Builds a public reputation as a medicine man and fair speaker, culminating in
#       arbitration recognition (1892–1895).
#     phase: Midlife (conflict, reputation-building, prominence)
#   - age_range: 61-77
#     key_events:
#     - From about 1898 onward, recurrent fever/weakness limits heavy farm labor; delegates
#       more to juniors and focuses on advising, ritual work, and mediation.
#     - 'Sees increasing reach of colonial administration (1900–1915): new courts/policing
#       and pressure for taxes; navigates these changes to protect compound interests.'
#     - Wife Mbaor dies around 1910; he becomes a widower and gradually shifts into
#       his adult son Terwase’s household.
#     phase: Late adulthood (chronic illness, colonial encroachment)
#   - age_range: 78-81
#     key_events:
#     - Community experiences the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic; household labor and
#       caregiving burdens rise.
#     - Lives as a dependent elder in Terwase’s household, still consulted for oaths/settlements
#       and medicines despite frailty.
#     - Dies in 1922 of a cardiovascular event (stroke/heart failure-like collapse).
#     phase: Old age

#     death_year: 1902
#     name: Iortyom
#     narrative_role: Youngest brother; energetic and sometimes reckless. Helps in conflicts
#       in adulthood, later becomes the family member most entangled with emerging colonial
#       rules and taxes.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds wide social network that supports his later prominence and
#       helps him recover standing after conflicts.
#     scene: He is consistently the one who speaks first at market-day meetings, jokes
#       to defuse tension, and volunteers to carry messages between compounds.
#     timing: Visible from adolescence onward; peaks in midlife during mediation work
#     trait: Extraversion (very high)
#   - consequence: Allows him to be trusted as an arbitrator and reduces the long-term
#       cost of his occasional violent outbursts.
#     scene: Even when accusing someone of theft, he frames it as restoring harmony—inviting
#       elders, offering face-saving routes, and accepting compensation instead of insisting
#       on endless retaliation.
#     timing: Most salient in adulthood (ages 30–60)
#     trait: Agreeableness (very high)
#   - consequence: Creates occasional resentment and suspicion; contributes to quarrels
#       that can flare into fights, but is buffered by his social charm.
#     scene: He bargains hard, keeps strategic information about his medicines and sources,
#       and sometimes implies stronger powers than he has to gain leverage in negotiations.
#     timing: Adulthood, especially ages 25–55
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (low)
#   - consequence: Maintains cohesion within the compound but can put him at odds with
#       younger relatives more open to missions/schools.
#     scene: He resists unfamiliar innovations and prefers established ritual/legal
#       procedures; when colonial rules expand, he tries to translate them into existing
#       customary categories rather than adopt new ways wholesale.
#     timing: Late adulthood (ages 60–75) when colonial administration consolidates
#     trait: Openness (low)
#   - consequence: Improves household food security and supports his reputation as reliable
#       and 'serious' in public matters.
#     scene: Keeps strict routines for field preparation and for medicine-making (timing,
#       taboos, ingredient handling), and expects juniors to meet work obligations.
#     timing: Prime adulthood (ages 20–60)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (moderately high)
#   - consequence: Increases dependence on younger kin for dealing with colonial officials;
#       reinforces his focus on customary mediation where he excels.
#     scene: He is practical and socially shrewd but struggles with unfamiliar administrative
#       concepts (tax categories, distant authorities) and relies on intermediaries
#       to interpret them.
#     timing: Most visible in late adulthood (ages 60–75)
#     trait: Intelligence (below average) expressed realistically
# number_of_children: '5'
# number_of_siblings: '8'
# occupation: Subsistence farmer (yams/other staples; household production with some
#   local market selling)
# religion: Tiv traditional rites with regular use of specialist healers/diviners and
#   protective medicines/charms (more intensive ritual practice than typical)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During the harvest season, someone repeatedly cut and carried away yams from
#     the edge of his family’s farm plots near the bush path; he noticed the missing
#     heaps over several mornings and confronted neighbors at the next market-day meeting.
#   reasoning: Small-scale theft (crops, livestock, tools) and occasional robbery were
#     common risks in agrarian compounds and markets, and prominence can make someone
#     a target.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Recurring pattern over one farming season, ages 33–34
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: After years of building a reputation for strong medicines and fair judgment,
#     he was publicly asked by multiple lineage heads to arbitrate a land-boundary dispute
#     between two neighboring compounds, and his settlement (with compensation and oaths)
#     was accepted without renewed fighting.
#   reasoning: Being a locally prominent figure in a lineage-based rural society typically
#     implies recognized success (mediating disputes, ritual expertise, farming success,
#     community leadership) beyond the ordinary.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Single major recognition event, around ages 52–55
#   type: major_achievement
# - event: While traveling back from a local market with a small bundle of goods, he
#     was ambushed on a narrow path by several young men from another settlement and
#     beaten with sticks and fists, leaving him with broken teeth and weeks of pain
#     before he could work fully again.
#   reasoning: Fights, beatings, feud-related assaults, and raiding-related violence
#     were common risks for men across adulthood, and his confirmed warfare exposure
#     increases the likelihood of non-domestic assault.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Single event, age 39
#   type: physical_assault
# - event: In a later quarrel over suspected crop theft and an insult at a beer-drinking
#     gathering, he struck a man with a hoe handle and joined others in a brief group
#     beating before elders separated them and demanded compensation.
#   reasoning: Participation in at least one serious fight/assault over land, honor,
#     disputes, or community defense is relatively common for adult men, and his role
#     as a prominent figure could include enforcing decisions or being drawn into conflicts.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Single event (one serious fight), ages 41–42
#   type: physical_assault_perp
# - event: From late middle age onward he suffered recurring bouts of fever and shaking
#     chills with long periods of weakness between episodes, limiting heavy farm work
#     and pushing him to rely more on juniors while he focused on advising and preparing
#     medicines.
#   reasoning: Surviving into old age in this setting often involved periods of chronic
#     limitation (recurrent malaria, chronic respiratory issues, pain/arthritis-like
#     conditions), even if not medically named.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Sustained period with recurrent episodes, ages 58–76
#   type: chronic_illness

Iorwase was born in 1840 in the Guinea savanna country of what is now Benue, in a Tiv-speaking farming settlement made up of patrilineal compounds. Elders settled disputes with oaths, compensation, and the threat of retaliation, and the wider region was shaped by trade and raiding pressures coming down toward the Benue basin. His father Terdoo farmed yams and mixed crops and spoke for his household in meetings; his mother Mnguhemba processed food, tended children, and carried loads between field and compound.

He came fourth in a crowded birth order. Terfa, the oldest brother, already carried a hoe like a man when Iorwase was small. Mbayange, the older sister, managed toddlers on her hip while pounding grain. Another sister, Kwaghdoo, died when Iorwase was still a baby. Two more girls, Mnger and Aondohemba, were born after him and died the same year. Mnguhemba kept their tiny cloths and tied them into a bundle she stored above the cooking place. The household did not speak of that bundle lightly. When sickness moved through the compound, she brought out a calabash of water, bits of bitter leaf, and rubbed protective medicine on the children’s wrists and ankles, then called on the lineage dead by name at the threshold.

Iorwase grew into a boy who did not sit still. He followed older men to gatherings and slipped close enough to hear the argument and the jokes. If visitors arrived at the compound, he carried the stool out before anyone asked. He liked roasted yam eaten with pepper and salt when there was salt, and he lingered near the cooking place to beg for the crisp bits stuck to the pot. Terdoo corrected him sharply when he boasted too loudly, but he also sent him to deliver messages because he talked easily and remembered faces.

In 1856, when Iorwase was sixteen, Mbayange died. She had been the one who kept the smallest children from wandering into the fire or the goat pen. Her death left a gap in work and in the way the compound sounded at dusk. After that, Mnguhemba insisted on more consultations with Akombo Utee, an older healer-diviner from a nearby place. Utee came carrying a small leather pouch and a horn container stopped with beeswax. He chewed bark, spat, and spoke the names of forces and ancestors over a gourd of beer. Iorwase watched every step. By the time he was grown, he could prepare bitter infusions and protective rubs himself, and he guarded his sources and ingredients with care.

He married Mbaor in 1862. The union was recognized with visits between compounds and gifts of food, and Mbaor moved into Terdoo’s compound, taking her place among the women’s work and the careful politics of co-residence. Iorwase cleared new fields with his brother Terfa and planted yams in mounds, staking some with cut branches. He rose early in the cool part of the day, then sought shade as the sun climbed, sitting on a low stool to chew kola when a trader passed it to him. He laughed easily and teased men by imitating their walk, but he kept a hard eye on measures in exchange. If someone tried to short him in market trading, his smile stayed while his hands took back what he considered owed.

His first child, a son named Iorkyaa, arrived in 1863. Two daughters followed, Mbayom in 1866 and Kwasehemba in 1869. Another son, Terwase, was born in 1872, and the youngest, Iorbee, in 1876. The children learned to carry water and gather firewood early, and Mbaor put them to work stripping cassava and watching for birds in the fields. Iorwase’s homestead remained tied to the wider compound, but he pushed for more land and moved his family’s sleeping huts slightly farther out, still within the network of kin.

In 1878, his firstborn Iorkyaa died at fifteen. The boy had started to speak in meetings and to show off in wrestling. After the burial, Iorwase sought out Akombo Utee and paid for stronger medicines. He began to spend more time preparing powders, rubs, and bitter drinks, and people started to come to him, not only for illness but for protection before travel.

Terfa died the next year, in 1879, at forty-three. Not long after that, Iorwase moved his household within Tivland to a nearby area with better access to fields and kin support, close enough that he could still attend the same markets and meetings. Shagher, his younger sister, had married into a neighboring settlement, and that tie smoothed the move. His youngest brother Iortyom helped carry yam seed and pots and made a show of strength, laughing too loudly at the boundary.

At harvest in 1873 and again in 1874, someone stole yams from the edge of Iorwase’s plots near a bush path. He noticed the missing heaps at dawn, after counting what had been left to dry. He did not rush into a fight then. He went to market-day, stood where men could hear him, and described the cut vines and the footprints without naming a person until elders pressed him. He named Gundo, a rival farmer from a nearby settlement, and demanded that the matter be settled with witnesses and compensation. The argument brought heat, then cooled into a negotiated payment of food and a public acknowledgement. Iorwase accepted it, but the resentment stayed on both sides.

In 1879, at thirty-nine, he walked back from a market with a small bundle of goods. On a narrow path he was rushed by several young men. They beat him with sticks and fists and left him with broken teeth and a swollen face. He lay in the compound for days, eating soft foods while Mbaor pounded and strained porridge for him. When he returned to the fields, he carried a short staff and rubbed protective medicine into his palms before travel.

Two years later, in 1881, a beer-drinking gathering turned into a quarrel. Someone repeated an insult linked to the old theft accusations. Iorwase grabbed a hoe handle and struck a man, and several others joined in a brief beating before elders pulled bodies apart. Ukaa, an older market-day elder, chaired the settlement. Compensation was demanded and paid: food, labor, and a ritual oath to prevent revenge. Iorwase did not apologize in private, but he complied in public and spoke with Ukaa afterward, listening more than he talked.

Terdoo died in 1888. With his father gone, Iorwase stepped into the role of household spokesman more fully. He disliked long delays in meetings, and he pressed people to state their claims plainly. He could be generous with food in his courtyard and enjoyed evenings when a Hausa trader named Sule passed through and shared news and salt. He liked to sit where the breeze came through the compound entrance and to hear children repeat stories badly and then correct them. He avoided long journeys in the wet season, and he grew angry when juniors left tools in the rain.

In 1892, lineage heads from multiple compounds called on him to settle a land-boundary dispute. They met on the contested ground, walked the line, and heard witnesses. Iorwase insisted on compensation and on oaths spoken over shared beer and a small offering placed at the boundary. The settlement held. After that, people sought his voice when arguments threatened to turn into fighting.

Mnguhemba died in 1898, and soon after that Iorwase’s health changed. In 1898, at fifty-eight, he began to have recurring bouts of fever and shaking chills. Some weeks he could not work a full day in the fields. He shifted heavy labor onto juniors and focused on advising, preparing medicines, and mediating disputes. He guarded the household’s stores carefully and could be sharp in bargaining, especially when someone came asking for treatment without offering a proper gift.

Colonial administration pressed into the region during his later years. Messengers and interpreters, including a man called Mr. Hart, spoke about new courts and rules and demands for payment. Iorwase understood compensation between kin and the binding force of oaths; he struggled with distant authority and tax categories. He leaned on younger men to interpret, but he made sure the compound paid enough to avoid trouble.

Mbaor died in 1910. After that, he lived in his son Terwase’s household, moving slowly between huts with a staff, still consulted for medicines and for the right words in settlement. During the influenza years of 1918 and 1919, the compound filled with coughing and weakness, and he sat in the doorway giving instructions about water, pepper, and rest, and about which elders to notify.

On February 15, 1922, he collapsed suddenly in Terwase’s courtyard and died the same day. The men of the compound washed his body, wrapped it in cloth, and buried him near the family ground, setting a small calabash with food beside the grave and speaking the names of ancestors at the threshold before the household returned indoors.
