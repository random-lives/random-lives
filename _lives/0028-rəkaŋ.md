Rəkaŋ was born after the late harvest, when the hills held cold air at night and smoke stayed low in the doorway. Her mother wrapped her in woven plant fiber and kept her near the fire pit. The hamlet sat above a narrow stream in a valley of evergreen trees and red, slick soil. Gardens and small fields clung to the lower slopes and the flats beside the water. People kept obligations through kin, favors, and remembered promises. What a household had was counted in baskets, jars, and the grain stored behind a sealed lid.

Her father worked the fields and made pots when the ground rested. He dug clay from a bank, wedged it with his feet, and shaped jars and bowls by hand. He fired them in a shallow pit, stacked with wood and broken sherds to hold heat. A good jar meant grain later. A jar that held fermentation without cracking could be traded for salt, cord, or a better stone blade. Rəkaŋ learned early that food did not only come from plants; it came from what could be made and then exchanged.

Her mother planted, weeded, and carried. She worked with a digging stick and a stone-edged hoe, squatting for long stretches, standing only to shift a basket strap higher on her forehead. When she returned she pounded grain in a mortar until her shoulders ached, then cooked over the fire and set offerings for the household dead on a small shelf by the wall.

Rəkaŋ came first, then a sister, then two brothers. She learned to keep a toddler’s hands away from the hearth and to hold a child still while a splinter was pulled. She listened more than she spoke. At shared meals she watched who arrived with a full bowl and who came with empty hands but reached first. She remembered faces better than tallies.

She also took what she wanted when she thought she could. When her mother was out in the fields and her father was at a neighbor’s firing pit, Rəkaŋ lifted the covering from the dried fruit stash and ate the sweetest pieces. She smoothed the top back flat and walked away without haste. When her sister saw and told, Rəkaŋ did not admit it. She looked at them as if they had mistaken her for someone else. The lie was steady and made her sister furious, not because it worked, but because it did not even wobble.

As she grew, the work became longer and heavier. She carried water from the stream, spread cut grass to dry, and hauled bundles of stalks from the edge of the fields. In the wet season the paths became clay, slick as oil, and the air smelled of rot and crushed leaves. In winter the shallows numbed ankles. Rəkaŋ did not complain, and she did not volunteer for the worst loads. If there were two ways to finish a job, she chose the one that spared her back and kept her face blank. People saw it. They did not like it, but she was seldom loud, seldom insulting, and she did enough that no one could drive her out.

She made mistakes that cost time. She miscounted bundles, then argued with her own memory. She opened the wrong jar and scattered eating grain into a basket meant for seed. Her mother caught it and struck the rim of the jar with her knuckles, sharp and public enough that the nearby women heard. Rəkaŋ swallowed the shame and kept working. She did not become careful. She became better at letting the correction slide off her.

When she was ready to marry, the agreement was made with a household over the ridge, close enough that the same birds called at dawn. She walked to the new compound with a bundle of cloth and a few pots from her father’s firing. The compound held several brothers with their wives and children, clustered around a packed-earth yard. Grain jars stood in a line along the wall, their lids sealed with mud. Her husband’s mother watched Rəkaŋ’s hands as she tied bundles and packed food for the field. The other wives watched too, measuring how much space she took and how quickly she yielded it.

Rəkaŋ learned the rules fast. She spoke softly, apologized without warmth, and offered help when an argument was already starting, not before. When a pot cracked and two women began to blame each other, she stepped between them and said she would fetch clay from a different bank and try again. She turned the quarrel into a task everyone could criticize. It kept the yard from splitting into sides.

The compound’s standing rose when the elders arranged a work party to cut back brush above the fields and dig new channels to carry water through the dry weeks. Men chopped and levered roots with wooden poles and stone blades. Women carried baskets of soil and stones and tamped down the channel walls with wet hands. Rəkaŋ worked hard but lost track of the basket count and had to ask another woman twice. The woman clicked her tongue and answered anyway. That night, after the work, the compound fed the helpers. Rəkaŋ carried bowls, refilled them, and poured fermented drink from a wide-mouthed jar until her wrists ached. She watched who expected to be served first and who waited to be asked. Later she told her husband, and he spoke to the right elder the next day. It was small, but it brought favors back.

After that, visitors came more often. People from farther valleys arrived with sea shells drilled for stringing, hard stone for better blades, and lumps of salt wrapped in leaves. They wanted pots, cord, and dried food. Rəkaŋ learned what could be offered first and what had to be held back. She set a slightly warped bowl on the mat and kept the best jar behind her calf. When a man complained, she answered with mild concern and gave him less than he demanded while making him feel he had won. It made the exchange go smoothly, and it made the other wives distrust her.

In a bad year the weather swung and then stalled. Early storms beat down the young plants, and later the stream ran low. Field edges cracked. People began to accuse each other of taking water at night. A lightning strike split a tree near the storage and left a long scar down the bark. A dog stopped eating and died. Rəkaŋ woke from a dream of dark water under roots and treated it like a warning, not a story. Before sunrise she carried a small bowl of grain and a strip of dried fish to the stream. She set them on a flat stone and poured fermented drink onto the ground. She spoke the names of household dead and asked the water and forest to leave the compound alone.

The elders called for a larger offering soon after. Families gathered at a spring beneath tall trees. Food was laid out on leaves and in shallow bowls. An older man known for speaking to spirits recited the old words and beat a small drum until the rhythm pulled everyone quiet. Rəkaŋ stood with the women, hands folded, eyes forward. The order of it calmed her more than any promise.

Her household tightened around children and work. She bore four. Two sons died before they could be weaned. A daughter lived long enough to walk and then stopped breathing after a fever that came too fast. One son survived. Rəkaŋ did not speak much about the dead children. She washed the cloths, returned to the fields, and kept her face plain.

Rumors came once of men downriver who stole pigs and tools. Most people talked themselves into fear. Rəkaŋ listened and then acted. She moved the best stone blades into a storage niche and shifted the grain jars deeper into the house, behind mats and bundles. When the rumor passed and nothing came, she did not claim credit. She simply put things back where she could reach them.

In her thirty-ninth year, as the heat began to break and nights turned cooler, illness ran through the compound. A child started coughing, then another. Soon adults coughed too, and the yard filled with the sound at night. Rəkaŋ kept working with a raw throat until fever made her legs weak. She tried to stand and direct where the jars should go and what greens needed washing, but her words shortened and broke. Diarrhea came and left her thirsty no matter how much she drank. The women fed her thin broth and pressed cool leaves to her forehead. Her husband’s mother sat close enough to see every swallow, as if watching could keep breath from leaving.

On October 15, 2203 BC, she stopped sitting up. Her skin burned, then went damp and cold. She spoke once, a few words that did not fit together, and then she did not speak again. She died on a mat in the inner room while the compound yard kept moving outside—feet on packed earth, water poured, a pot set on the fire because people still had to eat.
