Nai was born on November 1, 271, in a river-valley hamlet in the forests and fields of what is now eastern Guangxi, where Jin officials claimed authority but village life followed local chiefs and lineage elders. Her household spoke a Kra–Dai tongue and kept its dead close in memory. Food and incense smoke went to the ancestors at a small shelf altar, and offerings of rice, salt, and a splash of fermented drink were set out for the house spirit and the spirits of the stream and ridge.

Her mother, Mae, carried the household on her own. Nai’s father, Kham, did not live with them and never held the child. Mae worked rainfed plots and garden beds, then returned with a baby tied high on her back, stopping to rinse cloths at the water jar and to mash grain for thin porridge. When Mae went to the fields, Ya Sa, Nai’s grandmother, kept the infant under the eaves and watched for flies on the feeding bowls. Ta Nong, her grandfather, handled visitors and spoke for the family in village matters. Mae’s brother Lue moved between households, bringing news and small trade goods.

After Nai’s first rains and first cool season, she began eating more gruel and drinking water drawn from the stream. In late May of 273 she developed severe diarrhea. Mae boiled water and mixed thin rice-water, and Lue fetched the ritual specialist Phim, who tied a cord at Nai’s wrist and laid rice and egg at the threshold for wandering spirits. Nai died on June 2, 273. The family wrapped her in cloth and buried her on the edge of their fields, placing a small bowl of rice beside her and speaking her name once.
