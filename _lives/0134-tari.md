# Sex: F
# birth_order_position: 3
# cause_of_death: Parasitic disease/chronic infection leading to wasting/anemia (helminths,
#   etc.)
# ethnicity: Local South China upland (Guizhou) non-state communities (ancestral to
#   later 'southern Man' groupings; not part of Shang core)
# father_occupation: Subsistence farmer (rainfed cultivation; household food production)
# historical_context:
# - event: Year-to-year East Asian monsoon variability causing at least one notably
#     bad growing season (too much rain or too little), reducing yields of rainfed crops
#   timing: ages 0–7 (any year)
# - event: Regional plant pest or crop disease pressure (insects/rodents/plant blights)
#     leading to noticeable losses in stored grain or standing crops
#   timing: ages 0–7 (growing season / storage season)
# - event: Periodic inter-group tensions/raiding risk in upland borderlands prompting
#     heightened vigilance, temporary avoidance of certain areas, or fortification of
#     settlement
#   timing: ages 0–7 (intermittent)
# household_social_status: Lower-status/marginal household (poorer resources, fewer
#   kin ties, more insecurity)
# household_structure_at_birth: Nuclear family household (mother + father co-resident,
#   with children only)
# language: Sino-Tibetan (non-Sinitic; e.g., Tibeto-Burman varieties)
# literacy: Illiterate (could not read or write)
# mental_disorder: No clear modern mental disorder likely (within broad normal range
#   for a child, despite difficult temperament)
# migration: Stayed in/near birth settlement (only local movement within the same valley/cluster
#   of hamlets)
# mother_occupation: Household subsistence work (field labor + food processing/cooking
#   + childcare)
# narrative_plan:
#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Beren
#     narrative_role: Rainfed subsistence farmer; frequently absent in the fields/forest
#       edge. Relationship is affectionate but inconsistent—he rewards charm and boldness
#       yet punishes impulsive disobedience when it threatens food stores or safety.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Mina
#     narrative_role: 'Primary caregiver doing field labor plus food processing and
#       childcare. Relationship is strained by scarcity: she loves Tari but has low
#       patience for mess, waste, and risky behavior; relies on Sena’s help.'
#     role: mother
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 5
#     connection: A bad monsoon season and storage losses tighten food; adult stress
#       increases conflict and stricter rationing, amplifying Tari’s opportunistic behavior
#       around food.
#     incident: Severe economic hardship episode (acute scarcity)
#   - age: 3
#     connection: Common seasonal sickness; recovery leaves her somewhat smaller/weaker
#       for a time, making later chronic parasite burden more consequential.
#     incident: 'Serious health incident (non-terminal) possibility: high fever/diarrhea
#       episode'
#   - age: 6
#     connection: Most plausibly harsh corporal punishment or rough handling during
#       a tense scarcity period; links to low conscientiousness (getting into stored
#       food/ignoring warnings) and low honesty-humility (denying/blaming others).
#     incident: Victim of physical/sexual violence (low-grade physical violence most
#       likely)
#   - age: 4
#     connection: A brief period of heightened raiding fear leads to adults keeping
#       children closer, avoiding certain forest paths/watercourses; contributes to
#       anxiety around night sounds and strangers.
#     incident: Warfare/raiding impact (direct but limited)
#   - age: 6
#     connection: Gradual onset after repeated exposure to contaminated soil/water;
#       worsens during food-short months, leading to fatigue, pallor, breathlessness,
#       and reduced play before death at 7.
#     incident: 'Terminal condition: chronic parasitic disease/wasting/anemia'
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Hemu
#     prominence: appears at ages 4–7 during seasonal rituals; frames community norms
#       and fear of offending local spirits
#     relationship: neighbor woman/elder who leads communal place-spirit rites at the
#       stream and seasonal field-edge offerings
#   - name: Dalo
#     prominence: ages 4–6, especially during communal work days and times when children
#       roam near fields/forest edge
#     relationship: older boy from a nearby hamlet; frequent playmate and occasional
#       rival
#   - name: Eren
#     prominence: age 4 during heightened tensions; influences restrictions on children’s
#       movement
#     relationship: father’s male kin/neighbor who warns of raiding risk and helps organize
#       watchfulness
#   siblings:
#   - birth_year: -1397
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: -1397
#     name: Kalo
#     narrative_role: Firstborn who died in infancy; his absence hangs over the family
#       as a quiet fear of losing children, shaping how cautious the mother can be with
#       later births.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: -1395
#     death_age: 44
#     death_year: -1351
#     name: Sena
#     narrative_role: Older sister and closest child companion; responsible and capable,
#       she both protects Tari and resents having to manage her; later becomes the remembered
#       witness of Tari’s short life.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -1392
#     death_age: 7
#     death_year: -1384
#     name: Tari
#     narrative_role: Protagonist; lively, bold, and socially forward but impulsive
#       and sometimes selfish, often testing boundaries in a precarious household.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -1390
#     death_age: 37
#     death_year: -1353
#     name: Rumo
#     narrative_role: Younger brother; as a toddler he is both Tari’s ‘living doll’
#       and a rival for attention and food; later survives into adulthood, carrying
#       family stories shaped by Sena.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: More supervision, mistrust from Sena and her mother, and sharper
#       punishments in scarcity periods; occasional social backlash from other children.
#     scene: Tari takes extra dried food or a prized fruit, then confidently denies
#       it and redirects blame onto her toddler brother or a visiting child; she also
#       tries to keep the better portion for herself when food is shared.
#     timing: ages 4–6
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (12th percentile; very low)
#   - consequence: Small household losses (spilled grain, singed basket, missed timing)
#       that matter more in a marginal household; increases friction with mother and
#       drives some corporal discipline.
#     scene: She forgets assigned tasks (watching the small cooking fire, keeping pests
#       out of stored grain), cuts corners, and wanders off mid-errand to follow friends
#       or explore.
#     timing: ages 3–7 (recurring)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (25th percentile; low)
#   - consequence: Creates a wider web of playmates and occasional allies who share
#       food/news, but also gets her into trouble by drawing attention when rules are
#       being enforced.
#     scene: She inserts herself into older children’s games, talks readily to visitors/kin,
#       and seeks attention from adults during communal work or rituals at the stream/forest
#       edge.
#     timing: ages 3–7
#     trait: Extraversion (66th percentile; high-ish)
#   - consequence: More frequent quarrels with Sena and peers; adults label her 'sharp-tongued'
#       or 'hard to turn,' leading to earlier, stricter correction.
#     scene: Quick to argue, push, or demand her turn; she can be affectionate but is
#       not naturally conciliatory when challenged.
#     timing: ages 4–7
#     trait: Agreeableness (37th percentile; somewhat low)
#   - consequence: Increases dependence on Sena/mother during bad weeks; contributes
#       to emotional volatility and impulsive reassurance-seeking.
#     scene: During periods of sickness or raiding fear, she becomes clingier at night,
#       startled by sounds, and prone to sudden tears when scolded, even though she
#       is bold in daylight.
#     timing: ages 4–7 (especially when stressed/ill)
#     trait: Neuroticism (56th percentile; moderately above average)
#   - consequence: Adults keep directions simple; Sena is tasked with checking her work,
#       reinforcing the sister-as-supervisor dynamic.
#     scene: Learns practical routines but is slower with multi-step instructions (e.g.,
#       fetch water, then gather kindling, then watch the pot), making avoidable mistakes.
#     timing: ages 3–7
#     trait: Intelligence (33rd percentile; low-average)
# number_of_siblings: '3'
# religion: Animist place-spirit rituals with community participation (forest/water/mountain
#   spirits; seasonal rites for crops and protection)

Tari was born in a hamlet of thatched houses on a forested slope in the Guizhou uplands, where families farmed rainfed plots and answered to local elders, not distant courts. Her family spoke a Sino-Tibetan tongue and kept the valley's rules for spirits: offerings at the stream, respect for certain trees, and food set aside for the dead.

Her father, Beren, planted and weeded hillside fields and guarded stored grain from damp and pests. Her mother, Mina, carried water, cut fuel, pounded grain, and kept the cooking fire alive while watching children. Before Tari, their first child, Kalo, lived only days. Sena came next and learned early to hold a baby on her hip while working. Tari arrived third, loud and eager, and followed people everywhere. Two years after Tari, a boy, Rumo, was born.

At three, in the late rains, she took a hard sickness with loose stools and a hot head. Mina boiled thin gruel and kept her under a mat near the hearth while Sena carried water and washed rags in the stream. Tari recovered but tired easily for weeks.

When she was four, men from nearby hamlets warned of raiders moving through the forested ridges to the north. Eren, Beren's brother, helped set a night watch. Children stayed close to the houses. Tari still slipped away to the stream, and when Sena dragged her back she shouted and refused to admit she had gone.

A bad growing season came when she was five. The rains arrived late, and rodents got into the grain baskets. Food grew short. Tari stole dried tubers and denied it, pointing at her toddler brother Rumo when Mina found the missing food. Mina beat her with a switch. Sena pulled Tari away afterward and warned her to stop, but the next day Tari reached for the store again.

At six, her belly began to swell. Her skin went pale and she stopped running far. By the end of the year she sat down during small tasks and complained of dizziness. The swelling worsened through the cold months. She died on the first day of the new year, too weak to stand. Beren and Mina wrapped her in a woven mat and placed her in a shallow grave on higher ground beyond the houses. Sena set a small bowl of grain and a smear of meat fat beside the body for the path ahead.

**Issues found:**
- [Pass 4] Sena disappears after age 3, despite being the "closest child companion" per narrative plan
- [Pass 6] Raiding threat vague ("trouble along the paths") - needed specificity
- [Pass 6] Death transition too abrupt - jumped from symptoms to death in one sentence
- [Pass 7] Paragraph 2 ended with personality/visitor detail that broke flow
- [Pass 12] 5 of 7 names are CVCV pattern (Tari, Mina, Sena, Rumo, Kalo) - exceeds guideline but left as-is since these are established names
