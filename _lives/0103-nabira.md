#     name: Nyaboko
#     narrative_role: Youngest sister; more socially flexible than Nabira and often
#       acts as go-between with neighbors/affines, helping keep Nabira’s reputation
#       intact when her low honesty-humility sparks conflict.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds a reputation for reliability and 'properness' but also for
#       rigidity; contributes to friction with affines who want flexibility in exchange
#       and labor arrangements.
#     scene: Rejects new planting/brewing suggestions brought by visitors and insists
#       on her mother’s exact sequence of steps and taboo days, scolding younger women
#       for experimenting.
#     timing: adolescence through adulthood (ages ~12-45)
#     trait: Openness (very low)
#   - consequence: Generates disputes and suspicion; requires mediation by sisters/sons
#       to preserve the household’s respected standing.
#     scene: In beer/food exchanges, she measures strictly when paying out but is tempted
#       to underfill or redefine what counts as 'full' when selling; she also quickly
#       assigns blame to rivals after the theft to protect her standing.
#     timing: adult life, especially peak exchange years (ages ~25-40)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (very low)
#   - consequence: Household resilience during scarcity and after raiding; others rely
#       on her planning even when they dislike her strictness.
#     scene: Keeps meticulous mental accounting of granary stores, brewing cycles, and
#       labor obligations; during displacement and return, she organizes salvage, replanting
#       priorities, and rationing without delay.
#     timing: throughout, most visible in adulthood (ages ~17-52)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (high)
#   - consequence: Improves household material stability and her influence in disputes;
#       also amplifies the impact of low honesty-humility because she can out-argue
#       or outmaneuver neighbors.
#     scene: Anticipates seasonal shortages and adjusts exchange strategy—trading beer/food
#       when others are flush, storing durable items, and using careful negotiation
#       to secure tools or favors; quickly learns and recalls complex kin/obligation
#       networks.
#     timing: late childhood onward (ages ~10-52)
#     trait: Intelligence (very high)
# number_of_children: '3'
# number_of_siblings: '5'
# occupation: Farmer plus brewing/food production for exchange (beer, prepared foods)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: A thief (likely someone from a neighboring settlement or a visitor during
#     market/beer days) slipped into the cooking/brewing area and stole a bundle of
#     trade goods—dried food and a small iron tool—meant to be exchanged along with
#     her beer. The loss caused a public quarrel and suspicion between households, but
#     no formal restitution was obtained.
#   reasoning: Small-scale theft (food, tools, livestock, beer/produce) and opportunistic
#     raids were common enough that a market-active household would often experience
#     at least one loss over decades.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: around ages 33–36 (mid-1760s); recurring pattern over several months
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: She developed a long-running illness marked by repeated bouts of fever and
#     profound fatigue that returned every few weeks, leaving her unable to weed fields
#     or tend brewing fires for days at a time. She relied on herbal treatments and
#     help from co-resident kin, but the weakness persisted for years between partial
#     recoveries.
#   reasoning: Long-term limitations from chronic infections (e.g., parasitic disease),
#     recurrent fevers, chronic pain, or pulmonary disease were common in this ecology
#     and could persist for years.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: about ages 39–50 (late 1760s through late 1770s); sustained period
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: After one severe episode of illness, she was left with lasting weakness and
#     pain in one leg and hip, walking with a stick and avoiding long trips to gardens
#     or water sources. She could still manage food processing and supervise brewing,
#     but heavy carrying and extended fieldwork became difficult.
#   reasoning: Some people acquired lasting impairments (reduced mobility after injury,
#     partial blindness, hearing loss), but severe disabling outcomes were less frequent
#     than chronic-but-manageable illness.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: about ages 45–52 (mid-1770s until death); sustained condition
#   type: acquired_disability
# - event: During a period of raiding and armed tension, her household fled at short
#     notice to stay with relatives in a more defensible place, hiding stores and abandoning
#     some gardens. When they returned weeks later, parts of the settlement had been
#     burned and several granaries had been emptied.
#   reasoning: Localized raiding/armed conflict often affected civilians via flight,
#     temporary displacement, insecurity, and loss of stores or livestock, making this
#     the most typical direct impact.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: around ages 41–42 (early 1770s); single event with aftermath lasting weeks
#     to months
#   type: civilian_war_exposure

Nabira was born on the first day of November 1729 in a small farming settlement on the forested slopes north of the Ruwenzori. Her people spoke a local Bantu tongue and answered to nearby lineages and village elders rather than distant rulers; authority came through households, land rights, and the men who could gather followers. The land itself was held to be powerful and demanding. A stream bend and a patch of old trees marked a shrine place where families left offerings so gardens would hold and children would live.

Her father, Lukasa, kept banana stands and mixed fields and a few small animals. Her mother, Nakato, ran the cooking fires, the granary, and the brewing. The household had already buried two infants before Nabira was old enough to understand words for it. One was her sister Lusina, born in 1726, and then a brother, Kibone, born in 1728. The older sister Kasima, born in 1724, carried water and watched the younger children while Nakato recovered and returned to planting. In Nabira’s first years, Kasima stayed close, guiding her hands when she washed gourds and teaching her which baskets were for flour and which were for seed.

Nabira grew into a small girl with careful hands. She remembered what was measured out and what was stored away. When Nakato sent her to the granary, she came back with the right bundle and the right count of dried cobs without being corrected. Lukasa enjoyed that. He would set out a line of seeds and ask her how many more were needed to fill a basket, and she answered quickly. When her younger sisters came, Namusa in 1732 and Nyaboko in 1735, Nabira took on more watching. She did it without softness. If Namusa wandered toward the cooking fire, Nabira yanked her back and scolded her in front of anyone who happened to be there.

Nakato kept the family tied to the shrine places. On certain mornings she tied a strip of fiber around a small pot and set it at the base of a tree near the stream with a mouthful of beer and a pinch of ground grain. Nabira learned the order: wash, speak, set the offering down, step away without looking back. When a neighbor suggested a different sequence once—an extra leaf, a different direction of approach—Nabira refused and told the woman to keep her innovations to her own household.

Marriage negotiations began before Nabira’s seventeenth year. Lukasa spoke with men from a nearby settlement, not far enough to change the forest or the crops, only far enough that the paths and the creek crossings were unfamiliar. In 1746 she went to live with Kasolo, her first husband. The move was short, but it changed her days. She learned his family's fields, their taboos, and the obligations that came with being the wife who brewed beer for work parties and visitors.

She had her first son, Matobo, in 1748. Four years later, Lwanga was born. Nabira handled nursing and weeding and pounding and still made time to brew. Her beer was thick and predictable. She disliked the chatter that came with brewing days, yet she liked the control of it: who got served first, who drank from which gourd, who owed her a basket of dried fish or a strip of barkcloth. She sat slightly apart while people drank, listening and correcting. If someone complained about the measure, she would lift the gourd and show the line where it had been filled, then tell them to pay or leave.

A neighbor woman named Mbira brewed too, and the two of them competed for customers. Mbira teased; Nabira answered with a flat stare and a sharper price. Still, they sometimes worked side by side, stirring and watching the foam, and once they laughed together when a young man tried to impress them by swallowing too fast and vomited into the dirt behind the huts. Nabira laughed only once and then ordered the mess cleaned.

In 1758 Nabira carried another pregnancy to term. The boy, Kamaso, died within days. She did not wail in public. She sent Lwanga to fetch a healer, then to fetch her mother. Nakato arrived and took Nabira by the shoulder and led her to the stream shrine. They poured beer onto the ground, set down a small piece of goat fat, and tied fresh fibers to a forked branch. Nabira followed every instruction and corrected Kasolo's sister when she tried to move the offering closer to the water.

Nakato fell ill that same year and did not recover. After her death, Muboni, Nakato's sister, came more often to check on Namusa and Nyaboko and to counsel Nabira about running her own household. Kasima visited from her husband's settlement to help with the funeral preparations.

Lukasa died in 1762. Nabira returned for the burial and argued with an uncle over stored grain. Kasima stood between them and kept Nabira from escalating the dispute into blows. Afterward Nabira went back to Kasolo's settlement and spoke less often of home. She visited Kasima once or twice a year, trading news and bringing small gifts, but she kept her plans and grievances to herself.

Her brewing trade expanded in the mid-1760s. Visitors came from farther along the footpaths, some with iron tools and salt, some carrying news of raids and alliances shifting along the corridor between the lake lowlands and the mountains. Nabira listened, did the math of it, and stocked dried food for exchange when others spent theirs.

In 1764 a thief began testing her household. It started with small disappearances during brewing days—dried strips of food, a gourd missing from the stack. In 1765, during a crowded afternoon, someone slipped behind the cooking area and took a bundle meant for trade: dried food and a small iron tool. Nabira accused a visiting household loudly, naming a man she had seen near the hearth. An elder tried to calm it and demanded proof. None came. The quarrel lasted through the next market gatherings. Namusa, visiting from her parents' settlement, urged her to let it go. Nabira refused, and for months she served some people last and measured their gourds with extra care.

Kasolo fell ill in 1768 and died before the next planting. Nabira managed the household through the first weeks after, then his relatives began shifting decisions away from her. Matobo was twenty and eager to argue; Lwanga stayed quieter but watched where the stores went. Nabira did not accept being pushed aside. She went to her sisters, and Kasima helped arrange a new marriage.

She married Kagole in 1770. His household had fewer reserves, but his relatives were steadier, and he treated Nabira as a partner in planning rather than an inconvenience. Nabira set her rules from the first week: where the granary would be built, which garden would be planted first, and how much beer would be kept back for offerings before any was sold. Kagole agreed.

A year into the marriage, raiding intensified. News came first through traveling traders, then through frightened relatives arriving at night. In 1771 armed tension reached their area. Nabira buried small stores in sealed pots and wrapped tools in leaves to hide them under the floor. When word came that a party was moving through, they fled to relatives in a more defensible place. Nabira sat awake there, counting mouths and rationing flour. Weeks later they returned. Several huts had burned and granaries had been emptied. Kagole wanted to confront a neighboring settlement. Nabira stopped him and sent Matobo to speak instead, because Matobo could threaten without making enemies he could not later trade with.

The bouts of fever and heavy fatigue that had begun in Kasolo's final years continued through the 1770s. Some weeks she could weed and carry water; other weeks she could not rise early enough to reach the gardens before the sun. Namusa came to help during the worst stretches, grinding flour and watching the fire while Nabira slept. She consulted Senga, the ritual specialist at a nearby shrine, bringing beer, a chicken, and ground grain. Senga traced marks in ash and said the illness came from a path Nabira had crossed during the displacement, a place that had been angered by the burning. He told her which offerings to make and which routes to avoid. Nabira followed every instruction and made the household do the same.

A severe episode in 1775 left her with lasting pain and weakness in one leg and hip. She cut a sturdy stick and used it every day after. She stopped walking long distances and shifted to tasks close to home—sorting grain, directing the fire, tasting the mash, keeping count of what was owed. Lwanga took on heavier carrying and fieldwork. Nabira repaid him in her way, by making sure his household portion was never short and by backing him in disputes with in-laws.

Muboni died in 1776. She had been the one who checked on the younger sisters after Nakato's death, who smoothed things over when Nabira's bluntness caused offense. Namusa and Nyaboko buried her near their mother's people, and Nabira sent beer and a goat for the funeral but did not make the walk.

She took quiet pleasure in the first cup of fresh beer at dusk, before visitors arrived, sitting on a low stool where she could see the path. She enjoyed roasted plantain when it was browned and dry at the edges. Certain noises irritated her: children scraping gourds too hard, women laughing loudly during work, men dragging arguments into the brewing yard. Nyaboko, grown and quick with words, sometimes stepped in after Nabira refused someone, rephrasing the refusal in a way the other person could accept.

In November 1781, near the end of the rains, Nabira was struck by a sudden fever that moved fast. Kagole and her sisters brought water and herbs and kept the hut shaded. Nothing held. She died on the twenty-fifth day of the month, with Kagole in the household. Her body was wrapped and carried to be placed in the family's burial ground near the settlement, and a small pot of beer and a pinch of grain were set at the stream shrine before the return to the gardens.
