#     death_year: -2390
#     name: Sana
#     narrative_role: Youngest son; dies in adolescence around the time Pira loses a
#       partner, creating a compounded grief period.
#     sex: M
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 26
#     connection: Occurs during early adulthood amid repeated infant losses; the crisis
#       tests kin solidarity and is a key reason Pira later prioritizes fair distribution
#       and careful processing/storage.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 27
#     connection: Second season of disruption as channels remain altered; migration
#       within home territory to higher ridges shapes her detailed knowledge of alternate
#       food sources.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 38
#     connection: Begins as her older children become useful helpers; she can coordinate
#       labor and becomes trusted for fairness (honesty-humility) in dividing catch.
#     incident: major_achievement
#   - age: 45
#     connection: Peak years of recognition; she regularly hosts/coordinates monsoon
#       net-setting and processing teams across related camp clusters.
#     incident: major_achievement
#   - age: 55
#     connection: Recognition persists but becomes less physically demanding as she
#       transitions to planning, instruction, and adjudicating shares.
#     incident: major_achievement
#   - age: 49
#     connection: Happens during routine trap-checking; recovery forces dependence on
#       kin and demonstrates the value of her prior generosity (people help her because
#       she helped them).
#     incident: serious_accident
#   - age: 52
#     connection: After repeated fever seasons, persistent intermittent weakness begins;
#       links to her reduced mobility and increased role in near-camp tasks and childcare.
#     incident: chronic_illness
#   - age: 60
#     connection: Ongoing; family adjusts labor around her bad weeks, with daughter
#       Tali increasingly acting as her hands during processing.
#     incident: chronic_illness
#   - age: 72
#     connection: Late-stage limitation makes her more vulnerable to the final accidental
#       death (reduced strength/balance near water).
#     incident: chronic_illness
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6
#     key_events:
#     - Born into a widow-headed household; raised in a kin camp where grandmother Ven
#       and uncle Ravin provide stability and protection.
#     - 'Learns early river rules: how to stand on mudbanks, how to watch currents,
#       how to keep babies away from water’s edge.'
#     - Deaths of infant brothers (Kori, Tum) become formative memories shaping her
#       cautious, rule-bound habits.
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 7-17
#     key_events:
#     - 'Becomes a dependable helper: net-mending, shellfish collecting, carrying water
#       and fuel; often quiet observer rather than talker.'
#     - Sister Suma becomes her closest companion; they share work routes and ritual
#       duties during monsoon-season gatherings.
#     - Younger sister Hin dies at 17 (when Pira is ~17), reinforcing Pira’s protective
#       approach to youth and river travel.
#     phase: Later childhood & adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-37
#     key_events:
#     - First partnership with Dumak begins (~18); first births occur soon after, with
#       several early child deaths.
#     - Partnership with Dumak ends (~31) after instability/violence and/or his death;
#       Pira later forms a steadier union with Lutar.
#     - Severe flood-driven subsistence crisis (age 26-27) forces the camp onto higher
#       ridges and emergency foods; Pira’s reliability in rationing and processing becomes
#       visible.
#     phase: Early adulthood & peak childbearing
#   - age_range: 38-55
#     key_events:
#     - Becomes known for organizing communal net-fishing at monsoon onset and fair
#       distribution to vulnerable households (major achievement period).
#     - Serious canoe/riverbank accident at ~49 causes prolonged incapacity; she shifts
#       temporarily to processing and instruction roles.
#     - Develops chronic intermittent fever/weakness beginning early 50s; gradually
#       reduces risky river work.
#     phase: Mature adulthood (recognized contributor)
#   - age_range: 56-73
#     key_events:
#     - Lives in a multi-generational household with adult children (especially sons
#       Kori/Rinat and daughter Tali) and grandchildren; contributes through mending,
#       sorting catches, and childcare.
#     - Chronic illness continues with fluctuating good/bad weeks; she becomes more
#       of an elder presence during seasonal rites rather than a front-line fisher.
#     - Dies at 73 in a river-related accident (e.g., fall near bank/boat mishap) despite
#       generally reduced risk-taking.
#     phase: Old age
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Tari
#     prominence: Prominent during Pira’s chronic illness onset (early 50s) and in seasonal
#       rites; provides herbal treatments and interprets recurring fevers.
#     relationship: older woman/shamanic healer figure in the wider camp network
#   - name: Sorim
#     prominence: Prominent during Pira’s achievement years (late 30s to 50s); occasional

#     relationship: affinal kin (in-law) from a neighboring camp cluster; frequent collaborator
#       in net-fishing logistics
#   - name: Meko
#     prominence: Appears around the severe flood crisis (mid-20s) and later during
#       the accident (late 40s), helping repair boats and advising on safer crossings.
#     relationship: boat/canoe maker and river guide in the local network
#   - name: Halu
#     prominence: Early adulthood (20s-30s); his aggression contrasts with Pira’s temperament
#       and helps frame the victim-violence incident context.
#     relationship: younger man from Pira’s camp; involved in a conflict/assault episode
#       that makes violence salient
#   partners:
#   - name: Dumak
#     narrative_role: First long-term partner (pair-bond begins when Pira is ~18). Work-focused,
#       somewhat volatile; relationship includes at least one episode of partner violence
#       and ends after repeated conflict and/or his departure/death.
#     relationship_end_year: -2412
#     relationship_start_year: -2425
#   - name: Lutar
#     narrative_role: Second partner; steadier household arrangement during peak childbearing
#       years. Cooperative in fishing logistics; dies in midlife, leaving Pira widowed
#       again.
#     relationship_end_year: -2390
#     relationship_start_year: -2410
#   - name: Bel
#     narrative_role: Later-life partner; less about new children, more about companionship
#       and shared camp standing. Helps during her chronic illness; may survive her.
#     relationship_end_year: -2370
#     relationship_start_year: -2387
#   siblings:
#   - birth_year: -2443
#     death_age: 73
#     death_year: -2370
#     name: Pira

#   - birth_year: -2440
#     death_age: 41
#     death_year: -2399
#     name: Suma
#     narrative_role: Closest surviving sibling; more socially active than Pira and
#       often her bridge to gossip/alliances; they share work and later grieve each
#       other's losses.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -2438
#     death_age: 1
#     death_year: -2437
#     name: Kori
#     narrative_role: Infant brother whose death becomes an early memory of fragility
#       and motivates Pira's lifelong attention to careful food-sharing and childcare.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: -2436
#     death_age: 17
#     death_year: -2419
#     name: Hin
#     narrative_role: Younger sister who reaches adolescence; Pira helps teach her net-mending
#       and river safety; her death marks a turning point toward Pira's protective,
#       cautionary habits.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -2434
#     death_age: 1
#     death_year: -2433
#     name: Tum
#     narrative_role: Second infant brother; his death compounds the household’s sense
#       of insecurity and ties Pira more strongly to female kin networks for support.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds a strong reputation for fairness; people reciprocate with
#       care and food during her accident recovery and later chronic illness.
#     scene: During monsoon net-fishing, she publicly measures out shares and insists
#       the widowed and sick receive first portions, even when her own household is
#       hungry; she refuses to hide extra dried fish.
#     timing: Mature adulthood (ages 38-55)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (96th percentile)
#   - consequence: Reduces feuding risk for her children; increases her role as a trusted
#       mediator, supporting her later organizing role.
#     scene: After a dispute over a stolen trap stake, she de-escalates by proposing
#       a shared repair day and offering her own cordage as replacement rather than
#       pushing for punishment.
#     timing: Early to mature adulthood (ages 25-45)
#     trait: Agreeableness (85th percentile)
#   - consequence: Her household is more resilient during shortages; she is relied on
#       for planning communal work.
#     scene: She keeps nets consistently repaired, dries fish thoroughly, and enforces
#       routines (where to set pots, how to store smoked fish above ground) even when
#       others cut corners.
#     timing: All adult phases, especially during crisis (ages 26-27) and organizing
#       years (38-55)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (79th percentile)
#   - consequence: She gains trust as a steady worker rather than a charismatic leader;
#       influence comes through reliability and fairness, not loud persuasion.
#     scene: At seasonal gatherings she stays near the processing fires and listens
#       rather than leading songs; she speaks briefly, with practical suggestions, and
#       avoids boastful storytelling.
#     timing: Adolescence through old age
#     trait: Low Extraversion (19th percentile)
#   - consequence: Fewer risky innovations, but strong consistency; sometimes perceived
#       as conservative by more adventurous kin.
#     scene: She is cautious about adopting a novel net-weave pattern brought by visitors,
#       preferring proven designs; she only changes after seeing it succeed for a full
#       season.
#     timing: Mature adulthood (ages 35-50)
#     trait: Low Openness (32nd percentile)
#   - consequence: She prefers concrete roles (allocation by visible piles, repeated
#       procedures) and avoids overcomplicated bargains, which also reduces exploitation
#       risk.
#     scene: She struggles with complex multi-step planning when several camps coordinate,
#       relying on her sister Suma or son Rinat for counting/sequence; she excels more
#       in practiced routines than abstract strategizing.
#     timing: Mature adulthood (ages 38-55)
#     trait: Lower Intelligence (19th percentile, context-limited)
# number_of_children: '9'
# number_of_siblings: '4'
# occupation: 'Riverine forager/fisher: net/trap fishing, collecting shellfish/crabs/aquatic
#   plants (plus processing and camp work)'
# religion: Seasonal communal rites tied to monsoon/flood cycle and key foods (first-fruits/first-catch,
#   group feasting and dance)

# sibling_sexes:

# - F
# - M
# structured_incidents:
# - event: A year of unusually high floods shifted channels and ruined familiar fishing
#     spots, forcing her kin camp to abandon stored dried fish and broken nets and to
#     rely on emergency foods (wild roots, snails, and whatever could be trapped) while
#     they moved between higher forest ridges.
#   reasoning: “Economic crisis” maps to severe subsistence shortfall (famine-season
#     deprivation) or loss of critical gear/camp; being born vulnerable and living in
#     a flood-prone delta makes at least one severe hardship episode fairly likely.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Sustained period, roughly age 26–27
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: She became known within the local camp network for reliably organizing communal
#     net-fishing days at the start of the monsoon, coordinating who set stakes and
#     who processed the catch, and ensuring shares were distributed to widows, the sick,
#     and households with many children.
#   reasoning: In egalitarian bands, notable “achievement” usually means recognized
#     skill (expert fisher, healer’s helper, dispute mediator); her conscientious, trustworthy
#     profile makes this plausible but not guaranteed.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Recurring pattern of recognition, roughly age 38–55
#   type: major_achievement
# - event: While checking traps from a small canoe, she slipped at a muddy bank and
#     was pinned briefly under the boat in the current; she survived but suffered a
#     badly sprained/possibly fractured leg and chest bruising, leaving her unable to
#     fish or carry loads for many weeks.
#   reasoning: Riverine fishing/foraging involves boats, slippery banks, cuts and punctures,
#     and heavy loads; over a long life, a major nonfatal accident causing prolonged
#     incapacity is fairly likely.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Single event with long recovery, roughly age 49
#   type: serious_accident
# - event: After repeated seasons of fever and weakness, she developed a long-running
#     pattern of intermittent chills, body aches, and exhaustion that limited long trips
#     and heavy work; she shifted toward near-camp tasks like mending nets, processing
#     fish, and childcare on her bad weeks.
#   reasoning: Repeated infections, parasites, chronic respiratory issues, or long-term
#     pain syndromes are common in wet tropical environments, especially into later
#     adulthood.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Recurring chronic condition, roughly age 52–72
#   type: chronic_illness

Pira was born in a fishing camp on the low, wet land where channels of the great rivers split and rejoined. No chiefs sent orders into that country. Decisions were made by older men and women who could hold people together, and by family bonds between camps that moved with the seasons. Pira’s people spoke an old local tongue that outsiders did not share, and they kept the year by the floods: when the water rose, when it fell, and when the fish ran.

Her father, Nomat, was already dead. His name came to her as a set of remembered details—how he set a stake without splintering it, how he kept a canoe straight in fast water. Pira’s mother Mali carried the household without him. Mali gathered aquatic plants, pulled snails from the shallows, and came back with wet baskets of shellfish. Pira grew up watching her rinse grit away, crack shells with a stone, and hang meat on racks above a smoky fire. When Pira was small, her grandmother Ven did the steadying. Ven kept the hearth in one place, set the order of sleeping mats, and slapped hands away from the cooking pot until everyone waited. She required offerings when the first monsoon storms arrived: a pinch of dried fish and a few white shells placed on a flat root at the water’s edge, with a low spoken address to the river-ones and to the dead who had gone into the ground.

Pira learned the river before she learned much else. Ven taught her where the mud gave way, how to step so the bank did not slide, and how to watch for the thin line where current ran faster. Her uncle Ravin did the riskier work for the widow’s household. He crossed channels first, tested driftwood, and carried the heavier loads when the camp shifted. He also hit Pira once, hard, when she ran too close behind a canoe being dragged up the bank. After that, he made her practice standing still, hands on her head, until he said she could move.

Her siblings came in quick succession. Suma was born when Pira was three. Suma grew into a talker, bright-eyed, quick to join other children at play, and quick to repeat what she had heard. Two infant brothers followed, Dur and then Tum, each gone before their first wet season had passed into the next. Mali's breasts dried and filled again; she sat with her back against a tree, staring into the smoke after each burial, then took up her basket the next morning. Hin was born when Pira was seven and followed Pira everywhere, silent and close.

As a child, Pira had slept beside Ven and listened to her count out smoked strips of fish for each mouth. Ven died when Pira was twenty-three, and with her went the person who could insist on fairness without argument. Mali still kept the household, but hunger and fatigue made her sharp. Pira did not answer back. She took on more of the counting herself, making small piles of shellfish meat on a leaf so everyone could see the division.

At seventeen Pira lost Hin. The girl had been mending a net when she rose suddenly, dizzy, and vomited. She lasted only days. Pira washed her sister’s hair, rubbed her legs, and listened when Mali told Hin which ancestors to call to. After the burial, Pira avoided the spot for a season, taking a longer route to the shallows.

At eighteen she entered her first long partnership with a man named Dumak from a related camp. Dumak was competent with nets and traps and wanted Pira because she worked without complaint. He wanted quick decisions and loud agreement. Pira gave neither. She did what needed doing and spoke in short sentences. For eight years they shared a hearth and had children, though none survived infancy.

At twenty-six the floods rose higher than anyone in her camp remembered. Water pushed through places that had been firm ground. Nets hung too close to the water were swept away. The storage rack collapsed one night and the dried fish was ruined by silt and insects. Ravin led them to higher forest ridges where the ground stayed above the worst water. Pira and Suma dug for roots and found snails in seep pools, and Mali set small traps for eels in the backwater. Pira kept bundles of cordage dry under bark and rewove what she could, knot by knot, even when her fingers were raw. When arguing started over the last good net, she laid it on the ground and counted households aloud, including the sick and the widowed, and she handed it to a man who was not her partner because his household had more children. Dumak cursed her for that. Later he hit her with the back of his hand beside the processing fire. She did not strike back. She moved her sleeping mat nearer to her mother and sister for the rest of that season.

Dumak was gone from her life when she was thirty-one. Some said he left to join a farther camp; others said he died on a hunt away from the river. Pira did not chase the story. She accepted help from Mali and Ravin and kept feeding her children.

Pira had nine children over the years. The first three died young: Sey before his first dawn, Kali at two, Nira at one. These were born while she was with Dumak. After them came Lin, the first daughter to survive infancy, and then Kori, who grew sturdy even as Pira's partnership with Dumak was ending. A new partnership began when Pira was thirty-three, with Lutar, a man who had lost a wife and wanted a settled household. With Lutar she had Rinat, then Mira, then Tali, and finally Sana. Of the nine, Lin lived to fifteen and drowned checking a fish trap alone. Mira died at seven from a sudden fever. Sana, the youngest, died at fifteen during a bad wet season. In the end, three survived: Kori, Rinat, and Tali.

Pira's pleasures were plain: a roasted crab eaten hot before anyone else asked for it, the quiet before dawn when the water lay still, and the feel of a net she had mended lying even and tight in her hands. She disliked boasting and refused to gamble on dares at seasonal gatherings. When Suma teased her for that, Pira answered by flicking a bit of fish skin at her sister's cheek, and the two of them laughed.

At thirty-eight Pira began organizing the first monsoon net-fishing days for more than her own camp. People came from nearby clusters to set stakes, drive fish into shallows, and haul together. Pira stood where the catch was piled and made the division visible: fish in rows by size, shellfish in baskets, scraps set aside for broth. She told the young men when to stop taking and start carrying. She sent children with portions for the widowed and for those who could not walk to the water. She never pocketed extra. That, more than shouting or charm, made people accept her direction.

Ravin died when Pira was forty-one, in a fast channel crossing during the flood season. He had been the one who tested currents first, and without him the widow's household lost its steadiest male protector. Suma died three years later, at forty-four, when a cut on her foot festered and spread heat up her leg. Pira sat beside her through the last night, holding her hand and listening to her breathe until she stopped. Mali managed another four years after Suma's death, her hands slower but her voice still sharp when children reached for food out of turn. She died in her sleep during a cool dry-season night when Pira was forty-eight. Pira washed her mother's face and wrapped her in mats beside the place where Ven lay.

At forty-nine Pira had the accident that left her unable to fish for weeks. She went alone in a small canoe to check traps. The bank was slick with mud. She slipped as she stepped out, and the canoe rolled over her in the current. People pulled her out and she coughed river water and vomited mud. Her leg swelled and she could not put weight on it. For a long time she sat near the fire with her leg propped and her ribs aching, mending nets slowly. Others brought her food because they had eaten from her divisions in earlier years. Sorim, an in-law from a neighboring camp, made a joke about how Pira had finally found a way to avoid carrying loads, and Pira snorted once and threw a pebble at his foot.

Three years after the accident the fevers began. They came in the wet season first—chills, aching joints, then days when she could stand and days when she could not. Tari, an older healer woman, burned bitter leaves and had Pira breathe the smoke, then rubbed her with crushed herbs. Pira obeyed the instructions exactly. She stopped long crossings on bad weeks and stayed near camp, where she could sort fish, oversee smoking racks, and keep small children from wandering to the water.

Lutar died when Pira was fifty-three, struck by fever during a wet season that killed two others in the camp. Pira did not pair again for years. At fifty-six she took up with Bel, a widower from a related camp whose children were grown. The two shared a hearth and helped each other through bad weeks—he when his joints swelled, she when the fevers returned.

By the time she was sixty, her household was built around her surviving adult children. Kori and Rinat took on heavier work; Tali managed the hearth and the youngest grandchildren. Bel slept beside Pira and helped with light tasks. Pira still attended the seasonal rites. At the first storms she placed a small cake of pounded root and a strip of dried fish at the river edge and spoke the names of her dead—Ven, Mali, Suma, Hin, the children who had not grown. She did not cry during these lists. She spoke them clearly, then turned and began the day’s tasks.

She died at seventy-three. She had walked down to the bank with Tali to rinse a basket. Her foot slid on wet clay, and she fell hard into shallow water near a moored canoe. The current pinned her and she struck her head on the boat's side before anyone could pull her free.

Her family washed her body, wrapped it in woven mats, and carried it to the higher ground under trees where their dead were placed, leaving a bundle of dried fish and a small string of shells beside her hands.
