#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Fewer friendships and weaker bargaining power; relies on family networks
#       rather than broad social ties; avoids jobs requiring sales or constant interaction.

#       when directly asked, and uses her husband/older relatives as the 'talker' for
#       negotiations.
#     timing: Childhood through adulthood (especially adolescence and early marriage
#       years, 1985–2005)
#     trait: Extraversion (very low, 4th percentile)
#   - consequence: Earns a reputation as 'easy to talk to' and dependable; but is more
#       likely to tolerate unfair treatment and has difficulty refusing requests.

#     timing: Most visible in married life and during the debt crisis (mid-1990s–2000s)
#     trait: Agreeableness (very high, 96th percentile)
#   - consequence: Helps the family recover from debt; increases stress because she

#     timing: Young adulthood onward (1990s–present)
#     trait: Openness (low, 22nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Greater vulnerability to unfavorable terms and misunderstandings;
#       reinforces avoidance of institutions and preference for simple, concrete routines.
#     scene: Finds complex paperwork and calculations hard (loan terms, school forms);
#       depends on husband or literate relatives for bureaucratic steps, though she
#       can read everyday text.
#     timing: Adolescence onward; highlighted during borrowing/repayment period (1998–2006)
#     trait: Intelligence (low, 8th percentile)
#   - consequence: Avoidance of public situations and help-seeking; somatic stress (tension,
#       headaches/insomnia) and over-cautious decision-making.

#       say, sleeps poorly, and sometimes sends her husband instead; worries persistently
#       about debts, her son’s safety, and illness, escalating during COVID controls.
#     timing: Emerges clearly in adolescence; peaks during debt crisis (1998–2001) and
#       again in COVID era (2020–2022)

# number_of_children: '1'
# number_of_siblings: '0'
# occupation: Agriculture (farmer; possibly part-time with small sideline income)
# religion: Mostly secular/no regular ritual practice (may still do major-life/festival
#   customs)
# structured_incidents:
# - event: In the late 1990s, her husband borrowed money from relatives and a rural
#     credit cooperative to build/expand their house near the county seat and buy livestock,
#     but a livestock disease outbreak and a bad harvest left them unable to repay on
#     time, forcing them to sell animals and some stored grain and take high-interest
#     informal loans.
#   reasoning: Rural households in central China faced meaningful risks of medical-cost
#     shocks, debt, crop/livestock loss, or housing-related setbacks; staying 'ordinary'
#     suggests crises were possible but not catastrophic as a persistent condition.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: 1998–2001 (ages 24–27)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis

张丽 was born on June 16, 1974, in a mountain village in Zhushan County in northwestern Hubei, under the rule of the People’s Republic of China. Her family was Han and spoke the local Hubei Mandarin at home, with Putonghua entering her life later through school and radio. The house she was carried into held more than her parents. Her father, 张德顺, and mother, 王桂珍, lived with relatives, including 张德顺’s older brother 张宝林 and his wife 刘春花. The yard was shared. So were tools, grain stores, and arguments kept low so elders could rest.

As a toddler she learned where not to stand. Adults spoke in short phrases when unfamiliar people passed, and she kept close to her mother’s leg. In 1976, when the Cultural Revolution ended, the changes reached their valley slowly through talk at the production team meeting place and through notices pasted on walls. By 1978, the village school reopened more steadily. Teachers stopped disappearing. Her mother began to speak of sending her to class without the cautious tone she used when talking about politics.

From 1979, the farming system changed. The household responsibility system reached their area, and families began working contracted plots. The adults’ attention shifted to yield and to what could be sold. Cash mattered in a new way. 张丽 carried sweet potatoes in a basket, fed chickens, and watched her mother measure grain more carefully than before. Her father began leaving earlier in the morning, returning with dirt on his cuffs and a tight mouth, counting out seed by hand.

She started primary school in 1981. Her teacher, 陈淑兰, wrote characters slowly on the board and made the class read out loud. 张丽 read when called on, voice thin, eyes fixed on the page. She kept her hands folded and hated the moment when others turned to look. She learned to recognize and copy common characters and could write simple notes, but she stumbled on arithmetic and anything that required talking through a problem. She copied the same line again and again until it looked neat. When others chatted after class, she walked home with her head down, stepping around puddles, saving her breath.

At home, the household ran on small routines. Her mother rose before dawn, lit the stove, and boiled thin porridge. 张丽 peeled garlic quietly and washed bowls with cold water, rubbing until they squeaked. She liked the smell of steamed corn bread and the sharp bite of pickled mustard greens. When she was troubled, she went behind the house to the edge of the slope where a few persimmon trees grew and sat on a flat stone. She watched for a long time without moving, listening for footsteps.

She grew into adolescence during the 1980s as village life tightened around rules. Family-planning slogans appeared on walls and bridges, and cadres came with clipboards. Women’s cycles and births became public matters, discussed in whispers at wells and on paths. 张丽 avoided officials. If a meeting was announced, she waited until her mother had left and then followed behind, staying on the edge of the group. She learned Putonghua phrases from school and television, enough to speak when required, but she kept to the local dialect at home.

She left school after middle school. Her reading was steady for everyday use—signs, simple newspapers, notices—but she could not manage longer texts without losing the thread. She took on more fieldwork. She weeded slowly, line by line, not skipping patches. She bundled firewood neatly and stacked it straight. Her relatives teased her for taking too long and called her “careful to the bone.” She did not laugh easily in groups, but she laughed in the kitchen when 刘春花 told crude jokes about village men and then slapped her own thigh, daring anyone to scold her.

In 1993, her aunt introduced her to 李国强 from a nearby area closer to the county seat. He had a steady body and an easy tongue. He talked with elders without hesitation and could bargain at market stalls. 张丽 listened more than she spoke, nodding at the right times. After the New Year of 1994, the two families agreed, and she married that year. She moved within the county, closer to Zhushan’s busier roads, but still in a place where fields and hills controlled the days.

Marriage brought another household with more people watching. She rose before others to avoid kitchen crowds, boiling water and sweeping the yard while it was still dim. In private, she asked her husband to handle anything involving forms, stamps, or negotiations. When he suggested she speak for herself, she felt heat in her face and a tightening in her chest. She chose silence and finished her chores instead.

In 1996, she gave birth to a son, 李伟. The one-child policy shaped every conversation about babies. The local birth-planning office demanded paperwork and repeated visits. 张丽 kept every receipt in a cloth bag, folded flat, tied shut. She feared making a mistake that would bring a fine or a public scolding. She stayed compliant and cautious, and that caution became part of her daily movement through the world.

In 1998, 李国强 decided they needed a better house near the county seat and a livestock sideline to bring in cash. He borrowed from relatives, including 刘春花, and took a loan from the rural credit cooperative. The new bricks arrived stacked by the lane. For a brief season, their yard looked like progress. Then livestock disease hit. Their pigs went off feed and died quickly. That same year, the harvest was poor. Grain in the storage jars ran low before spring.

By 1999, repayment dates came faster than income. Loan terms confused 张丽, and she read the numbers again and again without understanding how the interest grew. She slept in short pieces, waking to calculate and recalculate in her head. When collectors came, she stayed inside and sent her husband out to talk. They sold animals that survived, then sold stored grain. When that was not enough, 李国强 took high-interest informal loans from a man who sat in a teahouse near the market. 张丽 recorded each payment in a notebook, writing carefully in square characters, lining up columns with a ruler. She stopped buying meat except for festival days. She stretched cooking oil and saved every scrap of soap.

That period also brought violence into her life. During one argument over money and debt, her husband hit her. She did not go to the police. She did not tell neighbors. She washed her face, kept the collar high, and went on with the day’s work. She became quieter. She watched people’s hands when they spoke, waiting for sudden movements.

By 2001, the worst of the crisis eased. The house stood finished enough to live in, though plain. Debts remained, but the frantic visits slowed. Her husband became more cautious with borrowing. She kept the notebook anyway. Their son grew into a boy who liked spicy noodles and comic books from a small shop near the school gate. 张丽 felt pride when he brought home a paper with a red stamp, even if she did not understand all the teacher’s comments.

Through the 2000s, she stayed in agriculture, growing crops and keeping small livestock again, but with fewer risks. She took occasional sideline work that did not require talk—cleaning for a relative’s small business during busy times, sorting produce, standing behind a stall only when her husband was present to speak. She preferred early mornings at the edge of the fields when the air was cool and other people were not yet out. She avoided weddings where she would be forced to toast and chat. She attended because refusal would cause trouble, but she sat near older women and refilled teacups.

With no siblings of her own, responsibility for parents did not spread among brothers and sisters. Her mother aged into joint pain, and her father tired more easily. She brought bags of rice and cooking oil, counted out medicine money, and listened to complaints without arguing. She also cared for her in-laws in the same steady way, cooking softer foods and washing bedding. She rarely said no to requests from family. When she resented it, she swallowed the feeling and scrubbed harder.

In 2020, COVID reached Hubei with sudden rules. Roads were watched. Markets closed and reopened under shifting restrictions. Village loudspeakers and phone messages told people where to stand, when to report, and what to show at checkpoints. 张丽’s worry tightened into constant vigilance. She washed hands until her skin cracked, saved masks in a clean bowl near the door, and checked her son’s messages for signs of risk. She kept to the home plot and avoided gatherings. When community workers came to check temperatures and registrations, she stood straight and answered in short Putonghua phrases, repeating them in her head beforehand.

By late 2025, 张丽 lives with 李国强 near the county seat area and still farms. Their son is grown and alive, and she measures his life through small facts: whether he ate, whether he came home on time, whether he sounded tired on the phone. She rises early, boils water, and lays out the day’s tasks in her notebook. She keeps receipts in the same cloth bag. At dusk she sits near the doorway where she can see the yard and the lane, shelling peanuts into a metal bowl while the radio plays quietly.
