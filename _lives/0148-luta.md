#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 32
#     connection: Occurs during peak provisioning years shortly after early children
#       are born; forces reliance on kin, highlights his honesty-humility (no hoarding,
#       accepts help), and pushes him toward a more craft-centered role.
#     incident: serious_accident
#   - age: 46
#     connection: Begins after repeated wet-season moves; episodes coincide with family
#       stressors (including the later death of son Peno at age 20), reinforcing his
#       pattern of contributing via planning, instruction, and meticulous tool work.
#     incident: chronic_illness

#       caregiving exchange with nearby adult children.
#     incident: acquired_disability
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6
#     key_events:
#     - Raised in an extended-family hearth cluster with grandmother Ramik; learns strict
#       routines for fire, water, and tool placement (foundation for later extreme conscientiousness).
#     - Observes infant and young-child mortality up close (older brother already gone;
#       later sees sister Sori’s vulnerability), shaping a calm but serious outlook
#       on care and risk.
#     - Begins accompanying adults on short gathering trips; shows unusual memory for
#       routes, plant patches, and safe crossings (early intelligence signal).
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 7-18
#     key_events:
#     - 'Age 7: younger sister Sori dies; mourning rituals and shaman-led ceremonies
#       are prominent, and Luta is given responsibilities (fetching water/wood, watching
#       toddlers) that he performs reliably.'
#     - Learns knapping basics and wood/cordage work; develops reputation for making
#       straight shafts and maintaining edges (craft inclination).
#     - Adolescent participation in longer hunts; demonstrates high sociability in camp
#       (storytelling, coordinating peers) but low openness through preference for proven
#       methods and dislike of novelty.
#     phase: Later childhood / adolescence
#   - age_range: 19-57
#     key_events:
#     - 'Age 21 (year -4308): forms long-term union with Wiranka; settles into a stable
#       pair-bond with cooperative ties to both families.'
#     - 'Ages 23-37: births of first four children (including a neonatal death); Luta
#       increases toolmaking output and becomes known for dependable repairs before
#       hunts.'
#     - 'Age 31-33: major leg laceration accident and long recovery; shifts his identity
#       toward ''hunter-crafter'' (more making/maintaining, slightly less long pursuit).'
#     - 'Age 42-60: recurring intestinal illness episodes begin; during weak periods
#       he remains socially engaged and useful through crafting, instruction, and dispute-settling
#       rather than brute endurance.'
#     phase: Adult life (prime years)
#   - age_range: 58-71
#     key_events:
#     - 'Age 58+: develops persistent limp (acquired disability); becomes a near-camp
#       specialist—maintains points, shafts, bindings, and teaches younger hunters.'
#     - Cares for sick or injured kin in an elder-couple household while adult children’s
#       hearths remain nearby; continues as a calm mediator with a reputation for fairness.
#     - 'Final years: frailty increases; dies at 71 in -4257 during a period of weakness
#       when recovery from minor illness/cold exposure is poor.'

#       his death.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Earns trust as the person whose gear doesn’t fail; others seek him
#       for repairs and for dividing meat/finding lost items because he notices details.
#     scene: He keeps a consistent ‘tool place’ by the hearth—shafts stacked straight,
#       points wrapped, bindings dry; after each hunt he inspects and re-edges tools
#       before eating or resting.
#     timing: Visible from childhood; strongest in adolescence through old age
#     trait: Conscientiousness (98th percentile)
#   - consequence: Builds broad alliances and reduces conflict around him; contributes
#       to 'middle/typical' status (trusted but not domineering).
#     scene: When a valuable stone blank is found, he insists it be shown and discussed
#       publicly rather than quietly kept; he is also the one who returns a mislaid
#       knife without bargaining.
#     timing: Young adulthood onward, especially during periods of scarcity
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (100th percentile)
#   - consequence: Improves group success rates and makes him a valued instructor; offsets
#       physical limits during illness/disability by keeping him useful.
#     scene: He quickly infers where game moved after a storm by reading broken branches,
#       water levels, and bird alarm calls; he also experiments within tight limits
#       to improve haft bindings and edge angles.
#     timing: Adolescence through prime adulthood
#     trait: Intelligence (95th percentile)
#   - consequence: Sometimes clashes with more novelty-seeking peers (notably younger
#       brother Tari), but overall increases safety and reliability.
#     scene: He is skeptical of new, untested hunting routes or novel tool forms; prefers
#       inherited patterns and demands repeated proof before adopting changes.
#     timing: Adolescence through adulthood
#     trait: Low Openness (17th percentile)
#   - consequence: Maintains influence even when sick or limping; people keep him informed
#       and include him in decisions.
#     scene: He speaks readily in camp councils, coordinates who carries what, and narrates
#       hunts in the evenings—more social glue than solitary craftsman.
#     timing: Adolescence through old age
#     trait: High Extraversion (82nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Reputation as a fair mediator; helps keep his household well-connected,
#       supporting caregiving reciprocity in later life.
#     scene: During disputes over sharing or accusations of carelessness, he stays calm,
#       listens, and proposes face-saving compromises rather than escalating.
#     timing: Adulthood and old age
#     trait: High Agreeableness (85th percentile) with low-average Neuroticism (33rd)
# number_of_children: '6'
# number_of_siblings: '5'
# occupation: Hunter-crafter (noted weapon/tool maker/maintainer alongside hunting)
# religion: Animist practice with more regular/central shamanic ceremonies (healing,
#   spirit negotiation, initiations) as a prominent community role

# structured_incidents:
# - event: In his early 30s, while cutting and shaping a hardwood spear shaft and fitting
#     a stone point, a tool slipped and deeply lacerated his lower leg; the wound became
#     badly inflamed and he could not walk or hunt for many weeks while kin kept him
#     fed and the band camped longer in a sheltered spot.
#   reasoning: As a hunter-crafter in rugged upland terrain, he faced frequent injury
#     risks (falls, cuts, burns, hunting wounds); surviving to 71 makes at least one
#     major accident with a long recovery fairly common.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 31–33 (single event with a sustained recovery period)
#   type: serious_accident
# - event: From midlife onward he suffered recurrent bouts of intestinal illness—episodes
#     of severe cramps and diarrhea with long periods of weakness—likely linked to parasites
#     and contaminated water during wet-season moves, reducing his stamina and making
#     him rely more on crafting and advising than long pursuits.
#   reasoning: Endemic parasitic burdens, recurrent infections, chronic dental disease,
#     and degenerative pain conditions often produce long-running limitations in older
#     foragers, even without modern disease labels.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 42–60 (recurring pattern over many years)
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: After about age 58, longstanding joint damage and pain in one knee/hip (worsened
#     by years of walking steep forested ridges and earlier injuries) left him with
#     a persistent limp; he increasingly stayed near camp, focusing on maintaining weapons
#     and repairing tools rather than joining long hunts.
#   reasoning: By late adulthood, partial hearing/vision loss, joint damage, or lasting
#     mobility impairment from injuries is common; reaching 71 substantially increases
#     the chance of some acquired functional impairment.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 58–71 (sustained period)
#   type: acquired_disability

Luta was born into a small network of related camps in the upland Atlantic forest, where people moved between ridges and creek valleys and met other bands to exchange mates, stone, and news. No chiefs issued orders. Elders and ritual specialists argued, advised, and persuaded. The band spoke a local language that left no descendant names. They dealt with the forest through shaman-led ceremonies, with tobacco-like smoke, rattles made from gourds, and offerings of meat fat pressed onto embers so the scent carried.

He came as the third child in an extended household that shared one cooking fire. His father Harok hunted and ranged widely, returning with small deer and thick-bodied rodents, and with stories of tracks seen near salt licks. His mother Maki carried babies and baskets, dug roots with a hard wooden stick, and knew which streams turned bad after heavy rain. A grandmother, Ramik, slept close enough to reach the coals without standing. Ramik decided where knives lay, where bindings dried, and which children carried water. Luta followed her rules without sulking. When he reached for something, he put it back in the same place.

His oldest brother, Eken, had died as an infant before Luta's first memories settled. The loss stayed inside the household in small acts: Maki's hand checking a baby's breath at night, Ramik's insistence that the sleeping mat stay clear of damp ground. Nemi, Luta's older sister by two years, was the person he watched most. She carried a toddler on her hip and still found time to tease Luta when he lined up sticks by length. Of the younger children, Tari came two years after Luta, then Sori, then Bena—a cluster of small bodies that Nemi and Luta helped watch when Maki's arms were full.

When Luta was eleven, the camp mourned again. Sori became sick and thin and stopped running with the other children. Tamak, the ritual specialist, came to their fire with a rattle and a small bundle of leaves. He blew smoke over Sori’s chest and rubbed her limbs with warm animal fat, then told the adults to leave a share of meat on a flat stone at the edge of the trees for the spirits that watched the paths. Sori died anyway. Afterward, Ramik kept Luta close and gave him tasks that filled his hands: splitting kindling, fetching clean water from a spring above the main stream, watching Bena.

As he grew, he learned the ordinary skills of boys—walking quietly, seeing fresh droppings before anyone else, holding still when a bird called an alarm. He also learned to keep gear in order. Harok gave him a battered stone blade and showed him how to hold it so it cut cordage without biting into his palm. Luta copied the grip exactly and corrected Tari when Tari tried to rush. Tari wanted to prove himself fast. The brothers hunted together as teenagers, and Tari’s impatience pushed them into arguments that ended with Nemi telling them to eat and stop talking.

By the time Luta’s shoulders broadened, he spent evenings with Pira, an older man who shaped stone and taught the finer points of binding a point to a shaft so it did not twist on impact. Luta liked that work. He liked the clean feel of a straight shaft and the way a stone edge could be brought back with a few careful strikes. He also liked sitting close to the fire at dusk, chewing roasted palm heart and listening to people retell the same hunting stories with small changes. He laughed easily, and people gathered close when he did. When talk turned to novel routes or strange tool forms brought by visitors, he argued for what they already knew and would not budge until someone showed success twice.

At twenty-one he took Wiranka as his partner. Their households clustered close for a time, and then the camp shifted with the seasons. Luta and Wiranka moved as a pair inside the larger band: a shared sleeping place, shared cooking, shared obligations. When he returned from hunts, he did not hide the best cuts. He laid everything out and let older adults decide the divisions. He could be stubborn about procedure, especially when hunger made people edgy, but his stubbornness took the form of insisting that the rules be followed in front of everyone.

Their first son, Jantir, arrived when Luta was twenty-three. Luta built a small windbreak of poles and palm fronds, reinforced the lashings, and checked them every night. A second child, Katuk, was born when Luta was twenty-six and died the same day. Wiranka sat with the baby on her lap until the body cooled; then Maki took the child and placed it in a shallow pit near a root mass where the soil stayed dry. A few strips of roasted meat and a pinch of red earth went in with him. Luta spoke little that day, but he kept moving—bringing water, sharpening blades, keeping others from crowding Wiranka.

Ramik died the following year, having slept closer to the fire each winter until one morning she did not wake. Without her voice in the household, Maki took over the ordering of tools and sleeping places, but Luta found himself checking the coals at night the way Ramik once had.

A third son, Teko, was born when Luta was twenty-eight. A daughter, Enka, came when he was thirty-one. When Luta was thirty-two, he cut himself badly while working a spear shaft. He held a stone blade too close to his leg, the edge slipped, and the cut opened deep. He bound it tight with fiber, but swelling came quickly. The camp stayed longer in a sheltered hollow while he lay with his leg raised on a rolled mat. Pira visited and retied the bandage when it loosened. Wiranka brought him broth thickened with crushed seeds, and Nemi kept Enka from crawling into the ash. When Luta could stand again, he did not return to long pursuits right away. He put more hours into making shafts, shaping points, and checking other men's weapons before hunts. It soothed him to bring things back into order.

A fifth child, Peno, was born when Luta was thirty-four.

Tari remained his closest hunting companion for a time. They joked, traded insults, and raced each other to a ridge crest, even after Luta's leg healed. When Luta was thirty-seven, Tari died. A fight broke out with another group near a water source after an argument over access—rare but not unknown when streams ran low—and Tari was speared through before anyone could separate the men. Luta helped carry the body back. Tamak shook his rattle over Tari's chest and spoke to the spirit that held the game, asking it not to take more. Luta kept his face steady while others shouted and cried, and then, at the end of the night, he walked away from the fire to sit where he could hear running water.

A sixth child, Sanuk, arrived when Luta was thirty-seven and died at birth. Wiranka had watched every pregnancy after Katuk with clenched hands and a tight jaw, and Luta had stayed close, taking on gathering and fuel work, insisting the sleeping area stay dry and cleared. This time the loss was quieter, but heavier.

Harok had grown thin and slow over the final seasons, and one morning when Luta was forty-two he could not stand. Luta helped carry his father's body to a hollow below the ridge where the old man had often waited for deer.

At forty-three, after wet-season moves when streams ran brown, Luta began to have bouts of stomach sickness. It came in waves: cramps, diarrhea, weakness that kept him near camp. The episodes returned year after year. During better months he still hunted, but he planned more than he chased. He sat with younger men and showed them how to seat a point so it would not split the shaft. He spoke in camp councils and cut off quarrels before they became fights. He listened, repeated what he had heard to show he understood, then suggested a division or a route that avoided trouble.

Enka died at twelve, after a short sickness that left her too weak to stand. Luta washed her body with warmed water and helped place it in the ground with a small bundle of cordage she had been learning to twist.

Maki died when Luta was fifty-one, quietly, in her sleep. The camp buried her beside Harok.

Peno reached twenty and then died during a river crossing after heavy rain, pulled under by current and debris. Luta stopped joining crossings for a time and made others test depth with poles before anyone stepped in.

By sixty he walked with a limp that did not leave. Pain took his knee and hip. He stayed nearer the fire and worked with his hands—retightening bindings, smoothing shafts, teaching his nephew Ranok how to find the right fiber for cord and how to dry it so it would not stretch.

Nemi died when Luta was sixty-two, after a short fever. She had watched him as a child, mediated his arguments with Tari, and kept Enka from crawling into danger during his injury. Now only Bena remained of his siblings. Bena had married into a band that camped a half-day's walk south, but she visited when the groups crossed paths, bringing news of people Luta had not seen in years.

In his late years Luta enjoyed honey when it could be found and the first hours after sunrise when the forest air was cool and quiet. He sat where he could see the main path into camp and greeted arrivals before anyone else did. Jantir's hearth stayed nearby, and Teko's too. Luta and Wiranka remained their own household, but help was close when it was needed.

In his seventy-first year, during a cold spell in the dry season, Luta stopped eating much and could not keep himself warm. Wiranka and Teko pressed warm stones wrapped in leaves near his feet and brought him thin gruel. He died on the sleeping mat by their fire. His family placed his body in the ground on a slope above the creek, with his best sharpening stone and a small portion of roasted meat set beside his hands, while Tamak rattled and smoked the grave so the spirits of the paths would not linger in the camp.
