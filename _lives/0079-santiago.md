Santiago was born on June 29, 1938, in the mining district outside the city of Zacatecas, in a Mexico governed by the post-revolutionary state and its officials, with parish life still organizing births and burials. His family spoke Spanish and called themselves Catholic, mixing church prayer with home cures and protective acts.

His father, José, worked as a low-ranking mine laborer. He left before dawn and returned with dust in the seams of his hands, paid by the day or by the shift. His mother, Antonia, ran the household and watched over their first child, María, born the year before. A small image of the Virgen de Guadalupe stood near a candle and a glass of water on a shelf. When María cried at night, Antonia rocked her and murmured prayers, then rubbed her belly with warm oil when she would not settle.

Labor started hard and did not ease. Antonia delivered at home with women from nearby houses. Blood came fast afterward. Isabel, Antonia’s mother, arrived and pressed cloths and murmured a rosary, then tied a red ribbon to María’s wrist against illness and envy. Antonia died the same day.

Santiago lived into July 1. The adults did not agree on why the baby failed so quickly; they spoke of a bad turn in the birth and the dangers that followed it. José asked Padre Rafael to come. The priest gave a hurried baptism and prayers, and Santiago’s body was wrapped in cloth and taken to the local cemetery for burial.
