H₁rewdʰéh₂ was born in late winter in 2296 BC in a small farming settlement in the mixed forests north of the open grasslands. The houses stood close, their walls packed with clay over wood, their roofs heavy with thatch. Her family slept in one house with more than one hearth. Her parents shared the space with her mother’s father, and with an older sister, the sister’s husband, and their small child.

It was her mother’s sixth birth. Five daughters had come before. Two had died before they could walk. One had lived only days. The others had grown into women who worked the same yard and fields. The oldest, thirty-six, kept her own pots by one hearth and fought with her mother at dawn over how much grain should be ground.

Her father spent most days with the animals—cattle and pigs—moving them between forest clearings and the field edges, watching for wolves and keeping them out of young shoots. When people arrived from other settlements, he listened more than he spoke. They brought salt and stone, and once in a while a thin piece of copper that everyone handled carefully before it went back into a bag.

When spring came, her mother returned to fieldwork with the other women. She weeded and planted, then came back to the house to feed the baby and went out again. When the first shoots rose, the household carried loaves and a jar of fermented grain drink to a cleared place beyond the houses and left it there for the powers they served at sowing time.

In August the heat dropped the level of the stream. The water turned warm and slow near the bank where people filled their jars. H₁rewdʰéh₂ began to pass thin stools and stopped taking milk. By the third day her mouth had gone dry and she no longer cried. She died on August 10, before the harvest started.
