# historical_context:
# - event: 'Burmese Konbaung influence and extraction in the Shan States: shifting demands
#     for tribute, corvée labor, and supplies routed through saopha and local headmen,
#     affecting household obligations and market conditions.'
#   timing: childhood through adulthood (c. 1780s–1830s)
# - event: 'Sino–Burmese borderland trade fluctuations: changes in caravan trade and
#     taxation on routes linking Yunnan, Bhamo, and Shan markets (including opium, salt,
#     cotton, metals), influencing prices and opportunities for petty traders.'
#   timing: adulthood (c. 1795–1833)
# - event: Severe monsoon variability causing localized crop failures and price spikes
#     (too-weak rains or damaging rains/landslides), increasing indebtedness and food
#     insecurity for marginal households.
#   timing: at least one major bad year likely during adulthood (c. 1790–1830)
# - event: Endemic malaria and periodic fever outbreaks in foothill/valley environments,
#     affecting labor availability and household finances through repeated seasonal
#     illness.
#   timing: recurring seasonal risk throughout life (all decades)

#     name: Ai Kham (father)
#     narrative_role: Skilled artisan tied to the patron/estate (woodwork and repairs
#       for elite households); affectionate but inconsistent as a teacher. He admired
#       Thida’s size/strength yet criticized her forgetfulness; his death tightens dues
#       pressure and pushes her toward market work.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: 1810
#     name: Mae Khammi (mother)
#     narrative_role: Domestic labor and childcare with seasonal field work; deeply

#     narrative_role: Infant death that echoes Thida’s own lost infant sisters; triggers
#       intensified household rituals and fear of spirit displeasure.

#   - birth_year: 1810
#     death_age: 17
#     death_year: 1827
#     name: Nai Chan (son)
#     narrative_role: Only son; expected to improve the household’s bargaining position.
#       His adolescence coincides with heavier extraction and instability; his death
#       removes future labor/security and worsens late-life poverty.
#     sex: M
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 37
#     connection: Begins after second marriage when trade income becomes necessary but
#       contested; violence peaks during debt years and after disputes over dues payments;
#       resolved temporarily through mediation by older kin in the extended household.
#     incident: domestic_violence
#   - age: 40
#     connection: Occurs during a bad harvest/price spike when dues are still demanded;
#       she withholds/shorts measures of rice/beans intended for the patron household
#       and sells the remainder at market to cover debt and feed children.
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   - age: 45
#     connection: Happens when she is market-active and cash-poor; theft of coin pouch
#       prevents immediate dues payment, triggering threats/shaming by the patron’s
#       steward and intensifying household conflict.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6
#     key_events:
#     - Born into a dependent household in a Shan principality; early years marked by
#       routine merit-making at the monastery and regular spirit offerings due to prior
#       infant losses.
#     - Learns domestic tasks early; her unusual height becomes noticeable by age 5-6,
#       making her useful for carrying water/firewood but also conspicuous.
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 7-17
#     key_events:
#     - Father’s artisan work ties the family to an elite household’s demands; Thida
#       is pulled into errands and seasonal labor rather than any schooling.
#     - Around mid-teens, begins accompanying older women to periodic markets, learning
#       small trading and bargaining through observation rather than instruction.
#     phase: Later childhood & adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-30
#     key_events:
#     - Marries Nai Senghka (c. 1790) and begins childbearing; household remains precarious
#       with repeated childhood illness and deaths.
#     - Endemic fevers periodically reduce labor; she starts selling small goods/food
#       more consistently to cover dues and rice gaps.
#     - By 1802-1804, loses two older brothers and a daughter; first husband dies by
#       1803, leaving her strained and more dependent on kin/patron structures.
#     phase: Early adult life (first marriage)
#   - age_range: 31-50
#     key_events:
#     - Remarries Nai Khamson (c. 1808) partly for labor pooling and protection; moves
#       a short distance within the district into an extended-kin setting.
#     - Domestic conflict escalates over her market trading and money handling; kin
#       mediate to keep the household intact.
#     - A bad harvest/price spike period around 1812-1814 intensifies debt and pressures
#       tied to tribute/corvée demands.
#     phase: Middle adulthood (remarriage, conflict, trade)
#   - age_range: 51-60
#     key_events:
#     - Ongoing regional instability and heavier extraction around the 1820s; her petty
#       trading continues but margins are thin.
#     - Loses her teenage son in 1827, increasing insecurity; eldest daughter’s competence
#       becomes central to household survival.
#     - Dies in 1833 from an acute respiratory illness after a short, worsening course.
#     phase: Later adulthood & old age

#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Chronic debt spirals, arguments with spouse/kin, vulnerability to
#       patron penalties, and occasional desperate corner-cutting (ties to perpetrator_property_crime).
#     scene: She forgets agreed quantities and due-dates, misplaces small bundles of
#       trade goods, and repeatedly promises to repay debts 'after the next market'
#       without planning; she improvises rather than keeping routines.
#     timing: most visible from adolescence through middle adulthood (ages 14-45)
#     trait: Very low conscientiousness (4th percentile)
#   - consequence: Limits upward mobility in trade; keeps her embedded in local networks
#       and makes her slower to adapt when trade conditions shift.
#     scene: She distrusts unfamiliar remedies and avoids experimenting with new goods/routes;
#       she prefers the same market days, the same offerings, and the same ways of doing
#       things, relying on elders’ advice.
#     timing: adulthood (ages 20-60)
#     trait: Low openness (14th percentile)
#   - consequence: Maintains some trust with neighbors/kin (important for mediation
#       after domestic violence), but also makes her susceptible to being pressured
#       into obligations she cannot meet.
#     scene: She is uncomfortable with bragging and tries to make amends after conflicts;
#       she shares food in small amounts even when poor and feels shame after shorting
#       measures.
#     timing: throughout life, especially after age 30
#     trait: High honesty-humility (76th percentile)
#   - consequence: Higher risk of being cheated, difficulty escaping debt, and increased
#       household dependence on more capable kin.
#     scene: She struggles with mental arithmetic in bargaining and is easily confused
#       by changing measures/credit terms; she relies on her eldest daughter to track
#       what is owed and what can be sold.
#     timing: most visible in trading years (ages 25-60)
#     trait: Low intelligence (22nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Physical capacity supports her trading and labor survival, but conspicuousness
#       increases unwanted attention in crowds (ties to victim_property_crime context)
#       and fuels spouse insecurity.
#     scene: She is repeatedly assigned heavy carrying and public tasks (hauling water,
#       carrying goods to market) and is remarked on as 'big'—sometimes respected for
#       strength, sometimes mocked as unfeminine.
#     timing: from late childhood onward (ages 10-60)
#     trait: Very tall stature (98th percentile)
#   - consequence: Pushes her toward ritual coping and sometimes hasty decisions under
#       stress (contributes to trade mistakes and household arguments).
#     scene: After child illnesses and poor harvests she becomes sleepless and irritable,
#       performing extra offerings and repeatedly checking on stored rice; she worries
#       about spirits and dues.
#     timing: adulthood (ages 20-55)
#     trait: Moderate neuroticism (55th percentile)
# number_of_children: '5'
# number_of_siblings: '6'
# occupation: Petty trader/market seller (small goods/food), alongside household labor
# religion: Everyday Theravada Buddhist village practice (alms/offerings, monastery

# structured_incidents:
# - event: While walking home from a periodic market with a small bundle of dried fish
#     and fermented paste (ngapi) to resell, she was jostled in a crowd near the path
#     by men carrying loads; a pouch with a few small silver coins and betel was cut
#     or slipped away, leaving her unable to pay a due owed to the household she was
#     attached to.
#   reasoning: Petty trading and market attendance increase contact with strangers and
#     opportunities for theft/fraud, and poor households are less able to protect goods
#     or absorb losses.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 44–46
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: During a season of debt and food shortage, she quietly shorted measures and
#     kept back a portion of rice/beans that were meant to be turned over as dues for
#     her patron household, then sold it at the local market as if it were her own household’s
#     surplus.
#   reasoning: Precarious poverty plus market activity raises the incentive and opportunity
#     for small-scale theft, cheating in trade, illicit forest taking, or evading dues,
#     though high honesty-humility lowers the likelihood.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 39–41 (during a bad harvest year)
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime
# - event: In her second marriage, after arguments over money and her market trading,
#     her husband beat her several times with his hands and a stick, and on one occasion
#     drove her from the house for a night; she later returned after mediation by older
#     kin in the extended household.
#   reasoning: She had at least two unions; in many historical rural settings intimate-partner
#     violence was common and often normalized, especially under economic stress and
#     limited recourse.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: recurring pattern, age 35–43
#   type: domestic_violence

Thida was born on July 1, 1773, in a small settlement in the uplands of the northern Shan States, under the authority of a saopha and his officials who drew rice, labor, and supplies from villages and dependent households. Her family spoke only Shan and lived close to the world of monasteries and spirit shrines: they gave alms when they could, and they kept a place in the house for offerings to the local phi so children would stay alive.

Two infant girls had already died in the household before Thida arrived. Her mother, Mae Khammi, tied white cotton threads at the baby’s wrist and placed a small dish of rice, salt, and a sliver of dried fish near the house post. Her father, Ai Kham, worked as a skilled artisan for an elite estate—mending carts, fitting bamboo and wood, repairing doors and storage bins. He came home with resin on his fingers and the smell of fresh-cut timber.

Thida grew fast. By the time she carried water, she could lift a jar that made other girls ask for help. Adults commented on her height in ordinary talk, and the patron’s steward, U Hseng, noticed too. When Ai Kham was called to fix an outbuilding or work on a cart for a household above them, Thida got sent along to carry tools and hold things in place. She did not keep track of small items. She left a knife in the grass and lost a cord needed for tying bundles. Her mother’s voice sharpened, then softened when she saw Thida’s face, and the scolding ended with another task.

Her older brothers, Seng and Chan, had different ways with her. Seng treated her like extra hands that needed to be trained. He corrected how she tied knots, made her repeat a route to a spring until she could do it without getting distracted, and reminded her of dates when dues were collected. Chan teased her, calling her “big sister” even though he was older, and made her laugh by imitating a monk’s chanting voice until their mother snapped at him. Thida liked Chan’s stories from the road—who had passed through, which goods were scarce—but she followed Seng when she needed to get something done.

By her teens she went to periodic markets with women from neighboring hamlets. Daw Homnai, an older seller of condiments, let Thida stand near her mat and told her which visitors haggled hard and which paid quickly. Thida preferred familiar goods: fermented paste, dried fish, chilies, betel. She hated long arguments over a few coins and would sometimes give in too early just to end the talk. The monastery remained the center of the calendar—festival days with candles and flowers, short periods of keeping precepts—and at home she helped her mother renew offerings at the spirit place when sickness moved through.

At seventeen, in 1790, she married Nai Senghka. The match kept her within the same district and within the same net of obligations. They set up a small household space under larger authority, and Thida took to work that suited her body: carrying loads, pounding rice, hauling bundles to market. She gave birth to a daughter, Nang Homkèo, in 1791. Thida trusted the baby’s care to her own mother whenever she could, because she forgot small dangers—open fires, sharp tools left where a crawling child could reach.

A second daughter, Nang Bua, arrived in 1794. The child’s stomach sickness came and went with the seasons. Mae Khammi boiled water with leaves for her, and Phra Khru Pannā, the local monk, tied a blessing thread and recited. Nang Bua died in 1797. Thida did not speak much afterward; she kept busy, and when she sat still she picked at her betel until her mouth was raw.

Later that year she had another daughter, Nang Khamnòi. Thida worked through pregnancies without planning for them. She forgot to put aside rice for the lean months and depended on her brothers and mother to bridge the gap. In 1801 she delivered a baby girl, Nang Kèo, who died the same day. Thida’s mother placed the tiny body in cloth and made offerings with sticky rice and candles, and Thida stood beside her, staring at the priest’s hands as if memorizing each motion.

Deaths continued in the family in a different way. Chan died in 1802 at thirty-three after a fever that left him unable to stand. Seng died two years later. In that same year, 1804, Thida’s daughter Nang Khamnòi died at seven. The losses tightened the household. With fewer adult men to meet labor demands, U Hseng pushed harder. Thida’s first husband, Nai Senghka, fell ill and died in 1803, leaving her with one living child and debts that did not disappear with him.

She turned more fully to petty trade. She carried goods between small markets and sold cooked snacks when she could—rice cakes, pieces of dried fish, betel and lime. She was honest in ordinary exchanges and hated being accused of cheating, but she also could not hold a plan in her head for long. She borrowed, promised repayment, then forgot who she owed until a woman confronted her near the market edge.

Mae Khammi died in 1810. Thida’s only son, Nai Chan, was born that same year, soon after her remarriage to Nai Khamson. Thida entered the second marriage for labor and shelter, moving to another village cluster within the district where older kin could share a roof. Nai Khamson disliked her trading. He wanted her in the house and the fields, not in crowds where coins changed hands. When she returned late from market, he demanded to see what she had earned. If she could not account for every coin, he shouted and struck her. In 1810 he drove her out for a night after an argument, and she slept near a cooking shed until Mae Seng, an older aunt by marriage, brought her back and sat both of them down. The beatings continued through the early 1810s, not daily, but returning with money troubles and drink.

In 1813 the rains failed in a way people remembered through prices. Rice cost more at each market. U Hseng still demanded what was due. Thida kept back a portion of beans and rice meant for the patron household, then sold it as if it were her own. She shorted measures too, pressing grain down in a way that left the basket looking full. The shame of it made her restless, and she avoided the eyes of Phra Khru Pannā when she brought a small candle to the monastery.

Her son grew into a thin, serious boy. Thida’s tall frame made him look smaller beside her, and she disliked that. She wanted him to stand proudly, to be taken for older. Her eldest daughter, Nang Homkèo, became the person who remembered. She knew which neighbor had lent salt, which stallholder expected payment, and which day U Hseng walked the route. Thida relied on her and resented being corrected in front of others.

At forty-five, in 1818, Thida walked home from market with a small bundle of dried fish and ngapi for resale. Near a narrow part of the path where men with loads pushed through, she was jostled hard. When she reached for her pouch, it was gone—coins, betel, and a bit of lime. She returned home angry, accusing strangers, then accusing her husband. The missing money meant she could not pay a due on time, and U Hseng made the household stand while he lectured them, threatening public punishment if it happened again.

The region’s politics and trade shifted in ways she felt as heavier demands and unpredictable prices. Caravans brought rumors from Yunnan and from lowland Burma. Nai Khamhpu, a porter she knew by sight, joked with her once about her height—“you could carry two loads and still walk straight”—and she laughed despite herself. She enjoyed that kind of talk, brief and simple, without bargaining. She liked sitting at dawn outside the house, chewing betel and watching steam lift off cooking pots before the day’s noise began. She avoided long journeys. She did the same markets, the same paths.

Her younger brother Kèo died in 1817, and the household absorbed another gap in labor and support. In the 1820s, with more uncertainty in the wider Burmese realm and new pressures from war beyond the hills, local officials pressed harder for supplies. Thida’s son, Nai Chan, reached seventeen and then died in 1827 after an illness that began with fevers and ended with a wasting cough. Thida’s anger turned inward to ritual. She renewed offerings at the spirit place with rice, salt, and small cups of tea, and she went to the monastery with candles even when she could barely spare them.

By 1833 she lived in an extended household with Nai Khamson and Nang Homkèo, and at least one grandchild underfoot. In late October she caught a chest illness that spread through households in the area. She coughed hard, struggled for air, and could not keep food down. She died on November 5, 1833.

Her body was washed and wrapped at home. The household brought candles and flowers to the monastery, and her remains were buried near the village with a small offering of rice and betel placed beside the cloth.
