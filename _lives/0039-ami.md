# Debug information (not displayed on page):
# Age at death: 0
# Birth date: October 6, 80828 BC
# Birth year: 80828 BC
# Climate now: Today the Volta Basin spans humid-to-semiarid tropical climates with
#   a pronounced wet and dry season driven by the West African monsoon. Much of the
#   basin is a mosaic of farmed landscapes, savanna woodland, and riverine forests,
#   with major flow regulation by reservoirs such as Lake Volta.
# Climate then: Around 80,828 BC the Volta Basin likely experienced a cooler-than-today
#   climate with stronger aridity and seasonality as glacial conditions intensified
#   in the Northern Hemisphere. Rainfall was probably lower and more variable, concentrating
#   people and animals near perennial river reaches, springs, and refugia with reliable
#   vegetation. Savanna would have expanded relative to wetter woodland phases, with
#   frequent fires maintaining open landscapes.
# Cultural tradition: undifferentiated
# Death date: June 3, 80827 BC
# Environment: A broad tropical savanna basin centered on the Volta river system, with
#   gallery forests along rivers, seasonal wetlands and floodplains, and open grasslands
#   with scattered drought-tolerant trees. Wildlife would have included large grazers
#   and browsers, abundant small game, and rich riverine resources such as fish, shellfish,
#   and waterbirds.

#       In infancy she was a small helper-at-the-hearth type—staying near camp, fetching

Ami was born into a small river-focused band in the Volta Basin savanna, where families moved between gallery forest camps and open grassland edges as water and game shifted with the season. No chiefs governed the group. Older hunters argued over meat shares, and older women decided where to sleep and when to leave. The band treated the river and certain old trees as places where ancestors watched. Noma's mother, Ena, kept a small bundle of river shells and red ochre for offerings.

Noma already had a daughter, Sal, a child who stayed close to the cooking fires and copied the women as they split reeds and scraped hides. Noma and Korin no longer lived as a pair. Korin visited camp, spoke little to Noma, and left again with other men to follow grazers along the drier ridges. Noma carried the work alone and leaned on Ena and on her own sister Bira for help with water and fuel.

Ami came early. She fit in one forearm, and Noma kept her tucked under a skin wrap against her chest while she gathered tubers from damp ground near the river and waded into the shallows to spear fish. Nights were cool in the dry season. Ena built the fire high and close and kept coals alive until morning.

Ami failed to gain weight. She did not feed steadily, and her skin stayed cool even when Noma held her tight. In the cold months before the next rains, Ami died in the sleeping shelter before dawn.

Noma, Ena, and Bira carried the small body to a sandy rise above the floodplain. They dug a shallow pit with digging sticks, laid Ami wrapped in soft hide, and dusted her with red ochre. Noma placed a few river shells on the grave before they filled it in.

**Review (Pass 1-14)**

**Issues found:**
- [Pass 4] Bira named but never shown doing anything in the narrative
- [Pass 11] "fish traps" potentially anachronistic for 80,828 BC
- [Pass 12] 5 of 6 names were CVCV pattern (83%), needed more diversity
- [Pass 14] Ena's relationship to Noma unclear on first mention
- [Pass 14] "her sister" pronoun ambiguous (could be Ena's or Noma's sister)
- [Pass 14] Burial scene read like archaeological report, needed more human touch

**Changes made:**
- Added Bira to burial scene alongside Noma and Ena
- Changed "checked fish traps" to "waded into the shallows to spear fish"
- Changed names for variety: Lena→Ena (VCV), Kori→Korin (CVCVC), Sali→Sal (CVC)
- Clarified "Noma's mother, Ena" when first introducing Ena
- Changed "Bira, her sister" to "her own sister Bira" for clarity
- Broke burial into two sentences, gave Noma the action of placing shells
