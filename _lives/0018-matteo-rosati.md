#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds a reputation for gentleness and piety (social support in hard
#       times) but also makes him easy to pressure in rent negotiations and informal
#       debts, contributing to downward mobility.
#     scene: He routinely yields in disputes over boundaries, debts, and tenancy terms,
#       choosing apology/compromise; he is the man who smooths quarrels after Mass and
#       lends small help even when he cannot afford it.
#     timing: Most visible in midlife (1880s-1900s) and after widowhood (1906+).
#     trait: Agreeableness (99th percentile) - extreme
#   - consequence: Chronic small inefficiencies accumulate into debt and tenancy instability;
#       dependence on wife first, then daughters/son-in-law, for planning and paperwork.
#     scene: He procrastinates on repairs, sowing schedules, and record-keeping; tools
#       go missing, boundaries go unmarked, and he is late to markets or offices, relying
#       on others to keep the household organized.
#     timing: Emerges in adolescence and persists through adulthood; becomes more consequential
#       during tax/bureaucracy expansion (1870s onward).
#     trait: Conscientiousness (10th percentile) - very low
#   - consequence: Less access to patronage and informal networks that sometimes help
#       tenants; fewer conflicts, but also fewer opportunities.
#     scene: He avoids tavern talk and loud gatherings, speaks little in meetings, and
#       prefers solitary tasks (watching animals, mending, quiet prayer) to social leadership.
#     timing: Childhood onward; particularly clear in young adulthood during conscription-era
#       musters and later in village politics.
#     trait: Extraversion (12th percentile) - low
#   - consequence: Supports basic literacy and curiosity; modestly improves ability
#       to navigate changing state demands, though not enough to overcome low conscientiousness.
#     scene: Despite limited schooling, he is drawn to sermons, religious stories, and
#       new ideas; he asks the parish priest about distant places, listens to travelers/emigrants,
#       and keeps a few printed devotions or pamphlets even if reading is slow.
#     timing: Adolescence into midlife (1860s-1890s).
#     trait: Openness (84th percentile) - high
# number_of_children: '3'
# number_of_siblings: '0'
# occupation: Smallholder/tenant farmer (contadino) cultivating mixed subsistence crops
# religion: Parish Roman Catholic, highly observant (regular Mass and devotions; frequent
#   confession/communion by local standards; strong involvement in confraternities/processions;
#   strict Lenten/fast practices)
# structured_incidents:
# - event: In his late 60s he developed worsening cataracts, and by the time he was
#     an old widower he could no longer reliably read or do fine farm tasks, needing
#     his daughter’s household to handle accounts and careful work.
#   reasoning: Partial disability (reduced mobility from injuries, vision loss from
#     cataracts/trauma, or hearing loss) was not rare by his 60s–70s, but becoming clearly
#     disabled (not just “aches and aging”) was less universal than having chronic illness.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 66–71 (c. 1915–1920)
#   type: acquired_disability

Matteo Rosati was born on June 27, 1849, in Capitignano, a high village in the Abruzzo mountains above L’Aquila. The area belonged to the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, ruled from Naples, and village life turned on the parish, the seasons, and small plots held by tenants and smallholders. He spoke the local Abruzzese dialect and used Italian only in the few situations that demanded it.

His mother died within weeks of his birth. His father, Domenico Rosati, kept the child in the house and in the fields, and leaned on women relatives and neighbors for the parts of childrearing he could not do alone. Domenico rented land and worked it hard, growing what the altitude allowed and keeping a few animals. Matteo grew up with the smell of smoke from the hearth and wet wool from animals brought into shelter. Domenico rose before light and Matteo followed, carrying water, pulling weeds, and learning to keep quiet when adults spoke.

The parish set the rhythm of Matteo’s week. Domenico took him to Mass, and when Matteo was old enough he served at the altar for Don Cesare, the parish priest. Matteo learned prayers by ear and repeated them while walking behind the plow. Don Cesare put a small printed booklet of devotions into his hands and made him sound out words. Matteo never became quick at it, but he learned to recognize the prayers, to trace letters, and to sign his name with care when asked.

In 1860 and 1861, uniforms and officials began to change. News came through L’Aquila and through men who traveled for work: the Bourbon kingdom was ending and a new Italian state was taking its place. Matteo watched Domenico sit at the table with other men, listening more than speaking, as they tried to understand new demands and new offices. Domenico stayed cautious. He paid what he could and kept his head down.

In 1867, when Matteo was eighteen, cholera moved through Italy again and fear reached even the mountain villages. People avoided the roads and watched outsiders. Don Cesare organized extra prayers and processions, and Matteo walked with a candle, keeping his eyes on the feet ahead of him. Domenico boiled water and insisted Matteo wash his hands before eating, a habit Matteo kept for the rest of his life.

Conscription became a fact of life as Matteo reached his late teens. In 1869 he went down for a muster and stood in line with other young men, silent, cap in his hands. He returned home soon after with no stories to tell, only the sense that the state could reach into the village when it wanted. For the next years, whenever the commune posted notices or called for men, Domenico and Matteo counted days and tried to keep planting and harvest from colliding with obligations.

Money became sharper in those years. The new taxes after unification hit the village through the mill and through fees that had to be paid in cash. Domenico watched every measure of grain. Matteo disliked the trips to town and the talk with officials. He did them anyway, but he put them off until he had to go, then rushed and came back annoyed with himself for forgetting a paper or misplacing a receipt. Domenico scolded him. Matteo lowered his eyes and agreed, and then the same thing happened again the next month.

Domenico died in 1874, leaving Matteo alone with the tenancy and the tools. Matteo was twenty-four. He could dig and sow and reap, but he never kept careful accounts, and he let small problems sit until they grew teeth. When the landlord’s agent argued over terms, Matteo gave way too fast, eager to end the talk. He worked harder to make up the difference, and took occasional day work when cash ran thin.

In 1876 he married Filomena Di Stefano in the parish church. Filomena came from another tenant family in the area. She brought a stronger sense of order into the house, and a way of speaking that got results. When Matteo drifted from one task to another, she set him back on the one that mattered. She kept a small kitchen garden, salted pork when there was pork to salt, and watched the few coins they had. Matteo let her. It was a relief.

Their first daughter, Lucia, was born in 1877. Matteo carried her to the font, stiff in his best clothes, and then went back to the fields. In 1879 Lucia died at two. Filomena wrapped the child and insisted the candles be set right for the prayers. Matteo did not talk about it afterward. He went to Mass more often and began to fast with strictness, even when work asked for more strength than he had.

That same year their second daughter, Caterina, was born, and in 1881 their third, Maria. Matteo’s household became a women’s household with a man attached to it: Filomena directing, the girls underfoot, and Matteo quiet, doing what was put in front of him. He liked the early hour before anyone else stirred. He would take a piece of bread, dip it in the leftover broth, and sit on the low wall by the path with his back to the wind, watching the light move across the slopes.

In 1884 cholera returned to Italy and word of deaths traveled from the towns. Filomena kept the children close. Don Cesare blessed water and told people to avoid crowds outside church. Matteo volunteered to help carry supplies to an older widow at the edge of the village. He never argued about it. He went, did the work, and left a little of their own flour on her shelf, even when Filomena frowned at the loss.

After 1877 the state pushed schooling harder, and officials expected signatures and papers. By the 1890s Matteo had to deal with forms more often: tenancy renewals, small disputes over boundaries, the commune’s notices. He could sign “Matteo Rosati” cleanly and he could read a simple line if he took his time. Anything longer went to Filomena or to a neighbor who read better. He disliked sitting still for it. He would start, grow impatient, and hand the page away.

Caterina and Maria grew into women and married men from nearby hamlets. Each wedding tightened Matteo’s connections to other households, and each one also pulled labor away from his own. The farm gave less than it once had, and debt returned in small bites: a borrowed sum for seed, a fee paid late, a goat sold early. Matteo took more day labor, especially in years when harvest disappointed.

Filomena died in 1906 after a short illness. The house emptied in a practical way. Within weeks Matteo moved into Maria’s household, where her husband Giulio managed the heavier work and the dealings with the landlord. Matteo kept doing what he could: feeding animals, cutting kindling, watching grandchildren for an hour while Maria kneaded dough. He attended Mass and confraternity devotions with a severity that made even other men in church whisper. He never raised his voice at Maria’s children. When one broke a tool, he fixed it badly and smiled as if it were fine.

War came in 1915 and changed the village again. Younger men were taken into the army, and Giulio spent days away dealing with requisitions and shortages. Prices jumped. Flour was measured tighter. Matteo listened to talk of casualties and said little. He made himself useful where he could, but his old habit of letting tasks slide returned whenever no one was pushing him. Maria would put a ledger in front of him to note a sale and he would delay, then stare at it too long, then pass it back.

In 1917 his eyes began to cloud. At first he blamed smoke and fatigue. Then he started missing stitches when mending a strap and misreading numbers on a paper. By 1918 he could not reliably read even the devotional print he had carried for decades. Maria kept the papers. Giulio handled the officials. Matteo shifted to work that needed hands more than eyes: sorting beans by touch, cutting herbs for the pot, counting rosary beads with practiced fingers.

Influenza reached the village in 1918. Houses went quiet and then loud with coughing. Maria kept Matteo near the hearth and away from visitors. Don Cesare, older now, came less often and spoke through the doorway. Matteo followed the fasts and prayers with stubborn discipline and then ate what Maria put in front of him, too tired to argue.

On November 8, 1921, Matteo suffered a stroke in Maria and Giulio’s house. He died that day at seventy-two.
