#     key_events:
#     - Raised in a multi-hearth compound under father’s and senior male kin authority;
#       learns routines of clearing, sowing, bird-scaring, and storage.
#     - Infant brother dies (1117); funeral and ancestor rites form early memories of
#       household spirituality.
#     - Shows early quickness with counting stores/seed and remembering boundary markers,
#       noticed by elders.
#     phase: Early childhood in extended patrilineal compound
#   - age_range: 7-19
#     key_events:
#     - Takes on heavier farm tasks; quiet temperament means he’s reliable in solitary
#       work (guarding fields, repairing fences) but not a leader in youth groups.
#     - Begins persistent low mood in adolescence (anhedonia, withdrawal), partly following
#       hard seasons and family stresses; still functions under kin supervision.
#     - Premarital relationship kept discreet during dance/beer gatherings while bridewealth
#       is being assembled.
#     phase: Later childhood and adolescence
#   - age_range: 20-34
#     key_events:
#     - Marries first wife (1131) and later migrates a short distance to a nearby settlement/land
#       patch, likely after a dispute or to access fields through kin ties.
#     - Second wife taken around 1140 when things look stable; polygynous household
#       forms with separate hearth routines.
#     - Expansion of periodic markets becomes more noticeable; occasional trips to exchange
#       grain for salt/iron/cloth.
#     phase: 'Young adulthood: marriage, household formation, short-distance move'
#   - age_range: 35-49
#     key_events:
#     - Victim of field theft in hungry season; seed shortage forces borrowing/obligations
#       and deepens dependence on senior kin.
#     - Extramarital affair during market travel; creates risk of conflict and contributes
#       to internal guilt/shame given high honesty-humility.
#     - Deaths of children/young adults and accumulation of obligations contribute to
#       becoming land-poor and less influential than birth household.
#     phase: 'Midlife: strain, status decline, and moral reputation'
#   - age_range: 50-64
#     key_events:
#     - Provides prolonged care for chronically ill first wife (early 50s) with older
#       children; she dies, followed by second wife a few years later.
#     - Lives as a widower/elder in an adult child’s or close relative’s household;
#       participates in ancestor offerings but with reduced vigor.
#     - Dies in 1175 during an acute febrile illness after a short course (malaria-like).

#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Gains a reputation for being 'clear-headed' and trustworthy, which
#       brings requests for help—but not necessarily higher status because he avoids
#       leadership roles.
#     scene: He’s the one who remembers exact field boundaries, storage-pot counts,
#       and the sequence of planting tasks; elders rely on him to settle small disputes
#       by recounting who planted what and when.
#     timing: childhood through midlife (ages 10-45)
#     trait: Intelligence (93rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Community trusts him with sensitive tasks, but his reluctance to
#       exploit others may leave him worse off during economic strain.
#     scene: When dividing grain or allocating labor, he avoids taking the better share
#       and resists opportunistic theft/cheating even during shortage; he returns a
#       mislaid market item rather than keeping it.
#     timing: adulthood (ages 20-60)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (91st percentile)
#   - consequence: Contributes to mediocre yields and vulnerability to setbacks; fuels
#       criticism from senior kin and helps explain the slide into land-poverty.
#     scene: He procrastinates on repairs and planting preparations until others press
#       him; fields may be weeded late unless a wife/kin organizes the work, and he
#       misplaces tools or forgets small obligations.
#     timing: adolescence onward (ages 14-50)
#     trait: Low Conscientiousness (15th percentile)
#   - consequence: Fewer allies in disputes and weaker access to cooperative labor beyond
#       close kin; increases reliance on household rather than wider social networks.
#     scene: At gatherings he sits at the edge, speaks little, and avoids boasting contests;
#       he prefers solitary tasks like fence-mending, bird-scaring, or early-morning
#       field checks.
#     timing: all life phases, strongest ages 12-45
#     trait: Low Extraversion (19th percentile)
#   - consequence: Limits initiative (interacting with low conscientiousness), strains
#       marital relations, and makes him less able to recover socially/economically
#       after losses.
#     scene: After repeated child deaths and poor seasons he moves slowly, sleeps poorly,
#       and shows reduced interest in music/dance and in the satisfaction of a good
#       harvest; he is functional but emotionally flat for long stretches.
#     timing: onset late teens; recurrent/persistent across adulthood (ages 17-64)
#     trait: Depressive disorder (persistent low mood/anhedonia)
# number_of_children: '6'
# number_of_siblings: '4'
# occupation: 'Subsistence/mixed-crop farmer (primary identity: cultivator; seasonal
#   fieldwork, food production)'
# religion: Household & lineage ancestor veneration (regular offerings at family shrines;

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During the hungry season, someone cut the fence to his family’s field at
#     night and stripped several ridges of ripening millet/sorghum, leaving him short
#     on food and seed for the next planting.
#   reasoning: Theft of crops, livestock, tools, or stored food was common enough in
#     small settlements and markets; his lower adult standing suggests some vulnerability
#     to losses and exploitation.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: late 30s (around ages 36–39)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: One of his wives became chronically weak with bouts of fever and wasting,
#     and he and his older children spent months fetching water and firewood, preparing
#     thin porridge, and seeking herbal treatments from a local healer until she eventually
#     died.
#   reasoning: Kin-compound living and limited specialist care meant families provided
#     most long-term care; as an older man and later widower, he likely had periods
#     of supporting an ill spouse/child/close kin.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 50s (around ages 50–54)
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: As a young man before bridewealth was fully assembled, he had a secret sexual
#     relationship with an unmarried girl from a neighboring compound during visits
#     to evening dances/beer gatherings, kept quiet to avoid sanctions.
#   reasoning: In many agrarian societies, premarital sexual activity occurred at meaningful
#     rates despite norms favoring controlled courtship; low conscientiousness slightly
#     increases likelihood.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late teens (around ages 17–19)
#   type: premarital_sex
# - event: While traveling to a periodic market a few days away to exchange grain and
#     dried goods, he began an affair with a married woman there, meeting when her husband
#     was away and giving her small gifts of food and cloth.
#   reasoning: Even with polygyny, extramarital relations happened (travel, markets,
#     marital conflict, fertility issues); high honesty-humility reduces but does not
#     preclude it over decades.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 40s (around ages 41–44)

Bènjiri was born on April 8, 1111, in the savanna country south of the Hausa-speaking towns, where authority rested in lineages and small settlement councils rather than courts. His people spoke a Benue–Congo language of the Plateau–Kainji range and kept their obligations at household and lineage shrines: libations to ancestors, food set aside at a family place of offering, and the work of funerals and naming.

He entered a compound that held several hearths. His father farmed mixed crops and organized field clearing through male kin, and his mother farmed too, then spent long hours pounding grain, cooking, carrying water, and nursing children. The compound belonged to his father’s patrilineal line. An older brother, Gómbara, was already big enough to chase birds from the ridges. When Bènjiri was small, his father’s brother slept under the same roofline, and older women moved between cooking places with toddlers on their hips.

Bènjiri learned early to keep track of things. When elders argued about whose seed calabash had been borrowed and not returned, he could say which hand had carried it and on what day. He had no taste for shouting games with other boys. He liked the quiet before dawn, when the yard was still and the goats shifted in their pen. He sat on the packed earth near the granary posts and counted tied bundles of stalks, checking knots with his fingertips.

In 1117, an infant brother was born and died the same day. Women washed the tiny body, and the men handled the grave work. Bènjiri did not forget the sound of the funeral talk and the way his mother held her hands still in her lap afterward. By then he had started to follow older boys to the fields, carrying water in a small gourd and learning how to mend a fence with thorn branches.

A younger brother, Túkoro, arrived in 1114 and grew into a quick-footed boy who liked to be in the center of talk. A sister, Lángiri, was born in 1120. Their father kept them working. In the wet season they weeded and replanted where seeds failed. In the dry months they helped strip and stack stalks, packed grain into storage pots, and repaired roofs. When a season of uncertain rains came, Bènjiri reacted by going quiet. He did his tasks, but he stopped joining in song at evening gatherings. He sat apart and watched.

At seventeen, he began slipping away to beer gatherings and dances held between neighboring compounds. He did not drink much, but he stayed late. A young woman from a nearby compound met him behind a cooking shelter, and they slept together more than once. He kept his voice low and watched paths carefully. He worked during the day with a heavy face, and at night he lay awake, thinking through what would happen if older men learned of it before bridewealth talks were finished.

In 1131, his family arranged his marriage to Sàkuma. The negotiations and transfers took time, and Gómbara, as the senior brother, spoke for the household. The wedding brought noise and food, and Bènjiri did the required greetings, then went back to his routines. He checked the storage jars, pushed his hoe handle through his palm to test the smoothness, and spent long stretches in the fields without speaking.

A few years into the marriage, the pull of land and kin obligations moved him. In 1135, he left his birth settlement for another place within a few days’ travel, where a relative offered him use of ridges near the edge of the mosaic of woodland and grass. He took Sàkuma with him. The move kept him within the same language and customs, but it changed his standing. He was no longer in the center of his birth compound’s decisions, and the best plots stayed behind.

Their first child, a son, was born in 1133. The boy grew into a lanky child who liked the goats and learned to set small snares for birds. In 1136, a second son was born, Núnkali. By the late 1130s, the periodic markets on the wider routes grew more active. Traders brought salt in small hard cakes and thin strips of cloth. Iron from smiths farther off changed hands. Bènjiri disliked crowded talk, but he learned prices fast and remembered who cheated with measures.

In 1140, Bènjiri took a second wife, Nàmari. He had hoped for more hands in the household and more children to carry work. Polygyny demanded more food and more mediation between hearths, and he left much of the scheduling to his wives. When weeding lagged, Sàkuma complained. He stared at the ground and promised to start at first light, then delayed until others pushed him up. He still refused to take an extra share when relatives divided meat at a feast, even when his own pots were running low.

A third son came in 1142. The household’s days filled with planting, weeding, harvesting, and storage, with trips to markets when grain could be spared. Bènjiri had little patience for boasting at the market edge, but he liked one part of it: sitting with a trusted man, a neighbor named Gàwuna, behind the stalls where the shade fell, sharing roasted groundnuts and listening to gossip about distant goods and the movement of people along the north–south routes.

In 1146, his eldest son died at thirteen. The boy had been helping to guard the ridges and came down with an illness that left him limp. After the funeral work, Bènjiri returned to the field and stood for a long time holding his hoe without moving. He did not stop farming. He simply stopped taking pleasure in any part of it.

In 1147, a daughter was born and died the same day. Three years later an infant son also died at birth. Bènjiri’s wives resumed work quickly, but he moved through the seasons with a flat face. He let small tasks slip: a fence gap left open, a storage lid not sealed tight. He could still calculate what was owed and remember exact words spoken in a dispute; he struggled to begin work without being pressed.

In 1149, during the hungry season before harvest, someone cut the fence to his family’s field at night. Several ridges of ripening millet and sorghum were stripped. In the morning he walked the length of the fence line and found the cut places, then went back to the compound and sat without speaking. The loss meant short meals and seed borrowed for the next planting. The obligations tied him more tightly to senior kin and deepened the sense that his household had slipped from where it began.

A younger daughter was born in 1153. She lived for years and followed her mother to the water place, carrying a small pot and making jokes about whose footprints were biggest. Bènjiri laughed once, briefly, when she hid a pestle and made her brothers search for it.

Market travel grew more regular in his thirties and forties. In 1153 he began an affair in a market settlement a few days away with a married woman named Mbakíri. He brought small gifts—dried grain, a strip of cloth—and met her when her husband was away. The secrecy sharpened him for a time. It also brought a hard knot of guilt. He became more withdrawn at home and avoided his wives’ eyes.

In 1162, his younger brother Túkoro died at forty-eight, and that same year Bènjiri’s nine-year-old daughter died. The following year, his third son died at twenty-one, a strong worker gone in his prime. The household’s labor collapsed. Bènjiri’s fields shrank, and he took work under other men’s direction more often. He still refused to cheat at measures or keep what was not his, even when hunger pressed.

In 1163, Sàkuma began to waste. Fever came in bouts. She stopped eating solid food. Bènjiri and his older sons fetched water and firewood, made thin porridge, and carried her to Kpángo, a healer who used divination and herbal washes. Months passed. Sàkuma died in 1164.

Nàmari remained, but her health failed later. By 1170 she was gone too, and in that same year Núnkali, the second son, reached thirty-four and carried most of the household burden. Bènjiri moved into his adult child’s compound space as a widower. He still attended ancestor offerings, pouring a measured libation and speaking the required names, then sitting apart while others ate.

In August 1175, after working briefly in a field near the compound, he was struck by a sudden fever. Núnkali and others kept him in the shade and brought water, and Kpángo’s herbs were tried again. On August 13, 1175, Bènjiri died at sixty-four.
