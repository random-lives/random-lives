#       learns routines of clearing, sowing, bird-scaring, and storage.
#     - Infant brother dies (1117); funeral and ancestor rites form early memories of
#       household spirituality.
#     - Shows early quickness with counting stores/seed and remembering boundary markers,
#       noticed by elders.
#     phase: Early childhood in extended patrilineal compound
#   - age_range: 7-19
#     key_events:
#     - Takes on heavier farm tasks; quiet temperament means he’s reliable in solitary
#       work (guarding fields, repairing fences) but not a leader in youth groups.
#     - Begins persistent low mood in adolescence (anhedonia, withdrawal), partly following
#       hard seasons and family stresses; still functions under kin supervision.
#     - Premarital relationship kept discreet during dance/beer gatherings while bridewealth
#       is being assembled.
#     phase: Later childhood and adolescence
#   - age_range: 20-34
#     key_events:
#     - Marries first wife (1131) and later migrates a short distance to a nearby settlement/land
#       patch, likely after a dispute or to access fields through kin ties.
#     - Second wife taken around 1140 when things look stable; polygynous household
#       forms with separate hearth routines.
#     - Expansion of periodic markets becomes more noticeable; occasional trips to exchange
#       grain for salt/iron/cloth.
#     phase: 'Young adulthood: marriage, household formation, short-distance move'
#   - age_range: 35-49
#     key_events:
#     - Victim of field theft in hungry season; seed shortage forces borrowing/obligations
#       and deepens dependence on senior kin.
#     - Extramarital affair during market travel; creates risk of conflict and contributes
#       to internal guilt/shame given high honesty-humility.
#     - Deaths of children/young adults and accumulation of obligations contribute to
#       becoming land-poor and less influential than birth household.
#     phase: 'Midlife: strain, status decline, and moral reputation'
#   - age_range: 50-64
#     key_events:
#     - Provides prolonged care for chronically ill first wife (early 50s) with older
#       children; she dies, followed by second wife a few years later.
#     - Lives as a widower/elder in an adult child’s or close relative’s household;
#       participates in ancestor offerings but with reduced vigor.

#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Gains a reputation for being 'clear-headed' and trustworthy, which
#       brings requests for help—but not necessarily higher status because he avoids
#       leadership roles.
#     scene: He’s the one who remembers exact field boundaries, storage-pot counts,
#       and the sequence of planting tasks; elders rely on him to settle small disputes
#       by recounting who planted what and when.
#     timing: childhood through midlife (ages 10-45)
#     trait: Intelligence (93rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Community trusts him with sensitive tasks, but his reluctance to
#       exploit others may leave him worse off during economic strain.
#     scene: When dividing grain or allocating labor, he avoids taking the better share
#       and resists opportunistic theft/cheating even during shortage; he returns a
#       mislaid market item rather than keeping it.
#     timing: adulthood (ages 20-60)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (91st percentile)
#   - consequence: Contributes to mediocre yields and vulnerability to setbacks; fuels
#       criticism from senior kin and helps explain the slide into land-poverty.
#     scene: He procrastinates on repairs and planting preparations until others press
#       him; fields may be weeded late unless a wife/kin organizes the work, and he
#       misplaces tools or forgets small obligations.
#     timing: adolescence onward (ages 14-50)
#     trait: Low Conscientiousness (15th percentile)
#   - consequence: Fewer allies in disputes and weaker access to cooperative labor beyond
#       close kin; increases reliance on household rather than wider social networks.
#     scene: At gatherings he sits at the edge, speaks little, and avoids boasting contests;
#       he prefers solitary tasks like fence-mending, bird-scaring, or early-morning
#       field checks.
#     timing: all life phases, strongest ages 12-45
#     trait: Low Extraversion (19th percentile)
#   - consequence: Limits initiative (interacting with low conscientiousness), strains
#       marital relations, and makes him less able to recover socially/economically
#       after losses.
#     scene: After repeated child deaths and poor seasons he moves slowly, sleeps poorly,
#       and shows reduced interest in music/dance and in the satisfaction of a good
#       harvest; he is functional but emotionally flat for long stretches.
#     timing: onset late teens; recurrent/persistent across adulthood (ages 17-64)
#     trait: Depressive disorder (persistent low mood/anhedonia)
# number_of_children: '6'
# number_of_siblings: '4'
# occupation: 'Subsistence/mixed-crop farmer (primary identity: cultivator; seasonal
#   fieldwork, food production)'
# religion: Household & lineage ancestor veneration (regular offerings at family shrines;

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During the hungry season, someone cut the fence to his family’s field at
#     night and stripped several ridges of ripening millet/sorghum, leaving him short
#     on food and seed for the next planting.
#   reasoning: Theft of crops, livestock, tools, or stored food was common enough in
#     small settlements and markets; his lower adult standing suggests some vulnerability
#     to losses and exploitation.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: late 30s (around ages 36–39)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: One of his wives became chronically weak with bouts of fever and wasting,
#     and he and his older children spent months fetching water and firewood, preparing
#     thin porridge, and seeking herbal treatments from a local healer until she eventually
#     died.
#   reasoning: Kin-compound living and limited specialist care meant families provided
#     most long-term care; as an older man and later widower, he likely had periods
#     of supporting an ill spouse/child/close kin.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 50s (around ages 50–54)
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: As a young man before bridewealth was fully assembled, he had a secret sexual
#     relationship with an unmarried girl from a neighboring compound during visits
#     to evening dances/beer gatherings, kept quiet to avoid sanctions.
#   reasoning: In many agrarian societies, premarital sexual activity occurred at meaningful
#     rates despite norms favoring controlled courtship; low conscientiousness slightly
#     increases likelihood.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late teens (around ages 17–19)
#   type: premarital_sex
# - event: While traveling to a periodic market a few days away to exchange grain and
#     dried goods, he began an affair with a married woman there, meeting when her husband
#     was away and giving her small gifts of food and cloth.
#   reasoning: Even with polygyny, extramarital relations happened (travel, markets,
#     marital conflict, fertility issues); high honesty-humility reduces but does not
#     preclude it over decades.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 40s (around ages 41–44)

Bènjiri was born on 8 April 1111 in a farming settlement on the upland savanna of what is now southern Kaduna. Authority sat with senior men of lineages who controlled fields, bridewealth, and dispute settlement. To the north, Hausa-speaking towns and older Sahelian states pulled goods and people along trade paths; in Bènjiri’s country, power stayed close to the soil and the compound.

He entered an extended patrilineal household. His father farmed mixed crops and organized labor through kin and age grades. His mother worked the weeding lines, pounded grain, carried water, cooked, and managed small stores. Bènjiri grew up under the eyes of his older brother Gómbara, born in 1108, who talked easily with other boys and took pride in finishing a task before anyone asked. Their younger brother Túkoro was born in 1114 and never seemed to sit still. A younger brother born in 1117 died the same year, and the women of the compound spoke his name during offerings at the household shrine. Their sister Lángiri arrived in 1120 and later married into a nearby settlement.

As a child, Bènjiri learned to move quietly through work. He carried seed gourds and watched how his father measured out planting. He remembered which corner of a field belonged to which lineage segment and which tree marked an old boundary. In the evenings, when elders argued over a strip of land or a missing goat, Bènjiri listened and could repeat the order of events without changing details to please anyone. That steadiness made older men send him on errands that required exact words.

His moods turned heavy in adolescence. He still went to the fields and did what was demanded, but he stopped joining the louder boys when they teased each other or practiced mock fights. At gatherings he sat at the edge, eating slowly and watching hands rather than faces. He liked the first work of dawn: walking the fence line when the air was cool, resetting a leaning stake, and counting the bundles of millet stalks left to dry.

In 1128, when he was seventeen, he began slipping away to evening dances and beer gatherings held by a neighboring compound. There he met a girl not yet married. They found a place behind granaries and had sex more than once. He kept it secret from his father’s household. He did not boast to friends. When talk of bridewealth rose, he avoided the girl’s relatives and took longer routes between compounds.

In 1131, at twenty, his kin assembled enough bridewealth and he married Sàkuma. She moved into the compound and built her hearth. Bènjiri did not charm his in-laws with words, but he negotiated cleanly and did not try to shorten what was owed. Two years later, in 1133, Sàkuma gave birth to their first son. Bènjiri held the baby awkwardly and then went back to the fields, counting seed and calculating how much grain the household needed to hold back for the next rains.

In 1135 the family followed a short-distance move to a nearby settlement, staying within their language community. The move settled a dispute over field rights and put them closer to land that a kinsman offered for cultivation. Bènjiri liked the new fields because the boundaries were simple and the soil held moisture longer. By then periodic markets were growing. People arrived with salt, iron pieces, and cloth that had come down from the north. Bènjiri did not love the noise of market days, but he watched weights and measures closely and learned which traders tried to distract a buyer while a companion slipped away with something.

In 1136 Sàkuma bore a second son. In 1140, when Bènjiri was twenty-nine, he took a second wife, Nàmari. The household now ran on two hearths. Each wife managed her own pot and her own store of ground flour, and both worked in the fields. Bènjiri did not keep tight schedules. He delayed repairs until a fence fell or until his older brother Gómbara sent a cutting remark through a messenger. When asked to gather stakes for a new fence, he returned with fewer than promised, then went back the next day as if the first trip had never happened.

A third son was born in 1142. In 1146, the eldest boy died at thirteen. He had been old enough to chase birds from the millet and to lead goats away from new shoots. After the burial, Bènjiri stopped attending most dances. He sat longer at the household shrine and made offerings with careful hands. He spoke less to his wives, and when they asked what he wanted for supper he answered, “Whatever is there,” and meant it.

In 1147 Nàmari delivered a daughter who died the same day. In 1150 an infant son died soon after birth. In 1153 another daughter was born. Bènjiri worked because he had to, but he pushed himself without pleasure and without the pride other men showed when a field stood clean of weeds. He did not threaten his family or seize their shares. When a neighbor’s goat strayed into his field, he brought it back and asked for a small payment instead of beating it or keeping it.

In 1149, when Bènjiri was thirty-eight, someone cut the fence to his family’s field during the hungry season and stripped several ridges of ripening millet and sorghum. The next morning he found the broken stakes and the bare stalks. He said little, but he went house to house asking who had been seen walking at night. Nobody answered. He had to borrow seed for the next planting and accept obligations he hated: labor owed to a senior kinsman and portions of future harvest promised before the seed even entered the ground. That year he ate thin porridge more often than he admitted, and his standing dropped in the settlement. Gómbara spoke to him with less patience and took charge of decisions that once would have been Bènjiri’s.

By 1152, market travel had become routine for many households. Bènjiri made the journey a few days away to exchange grain and dried goods for salt and small iron tools. On those trips he began meeting Mbakíri, a married woman there. He gave her small gifts—grain, a strip of cloth—and met her when her husband was away. He kept it hidden, but he carried it inside him. After returning home he avoided his wives’ eyes. He did not confess. He also did not stop.

In 1162 two deaths hit close. His younger brother Túkoro died at forty-eight, and Bènjiri’s nine-year-old daughter fell sick and died the same year. The household’s labor thinned. The fields did not get weeded on time. Bènjiri’s third son, strong and quick, died in 1163 at twenty-one, leaving Bènjiri with only one adult son still alive.

In 1163 Sàkuma began wasting. Fever came and went. She lost weight and could not keep up with fieldwork. Bènjiri and the surviving older son carried water, gathered firewood, and cooked thin porridge for her. They took her to Kpángo, a healer, who gave bitter infusions and performed rites over a small bundle of herbs and hair. Bènjiri followed instructions exactly. He did not argue over payment. Sàkuma died in 1164.

Nàmari held the household together for a few more years, then died in 1170. That year Bènjiri’s second son reached thirty-four and died as well. Without wives and without sons, Bènjiri moved into the household of adult relatives and depended on them for food and a place by the fire. He still rose early. He swept his sleeping area, checked the granary lashing when others forgot, and went quiet at gatherings, listening and remembering.

In August 1175, during the rains, Bènjiri fell into an acute febrile illness. He stayed on his mat in the compound, drank what he was given, and could not stand. On 13 August 1175 he died at sixty-four.
