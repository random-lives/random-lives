#     key_events:
#     - Raised in a multi-hearth compound under father’s and senior male kin authority;
#       learns routines of clearing, sowing, bird-scaring, and storage.
#     - Infant brother dies (1117); funeral and ancestor rites form early memories of
#       household spirituality.
#     - Shows early quickness with counting stores/seed and remembering boundary markers,
#       noticed by elders.
#     phase: Early childhood in extended patrilineal compound
#   - age_range: 7-19
#     key_events:
#     - Takes on heavier farm tasks; quiet temperament means he’s reliable in solitary
#       work (guarding fields, repairing fences) but not a leader in youth groups.
#     - Begins persistent low mood in adolescence (anhedonia, withdrawal), partly following
#       hard seasons and family stresses; still functions under kin supervision.
#     - Premarital relationship kept discreet during dance/beer gatherings while bridewealth
#       is being assembled.
#     phase: Later childhood and adolescence
#   - age_range: 20-34
#     key_events:
#     - Marries first wife (1131) and later migrates a short distance to a nearby settlement/land
#       patch, likely after a dispute or to access fields through kin ties.
#     - Second wife taken around 1140 when things look stable; polygynous household
#       forms with separate hearth routines.
#     - Expansion of periodic markets becomes more noticeable; occasional trips to exchange
#       grain for salt/iron/cloth.
#     phase: 'Young adulthood: marriage, household formation, short-distance move'
#   - age_range: 35-49
#     key_events:
#     - Victim of field theft in hungry season; seed shortage forces borrowing/obligations
#       and deepens dependence on senior kin.
#     - Extramarital affair during market travel; creates risk of conflict and contributes
#       to internal guilt/shame given high honesty-humility.
#     - Deaths of children/young adults and accumulation of obligations contribute to
#       becoming land-poor and less influential than birth household.
#     phase: 'Midlife: strain, status decline, and moral reputation'
#   - age_range: 50-64
#     key_events:
#     - Provides prolonged care for chronically ill first wife (early 50s) with older
#       children; she dies, followed by second wife a few years later.
#     - Lives as a widower/elder in an adult child’s or close relative’s household;
#       participates in ancestor offerings but with reduced vigor.
#     - Dies in 1175 during an acute febrile illness after a short course (malaria-like).

#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Gains a reputation for being 'clear-headed' and trustworthy, which
#       brings requests for help—but not necessarily higher status because he avoids
#       leadership roles.
#     scene: He’s the one who remembers exact field boundaries, storage-pot counts,
#       and the sequence of planting tasks; elders rely on him to settle small disputes
#       by recounting who planted what and when.
#     timing: childhood through midlife (ages 10-45)
#     trait: Intelligence (93rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Community trusts him with sensitive tasks, but his reluctance to
#       exploit others may leave him worse off during economic strain.
#     scene: When dividing grain or allocating labor, he avoids taking the better share
#       and resists opportunistic theft/cheating even during shortage; he returns a
#       mislaid market item rather than keeping it.
#     timing: adulthood (ages 20-60)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (91st percentile)
#   - consequence: Contributes to mediocre yields and vulnerability to setbacks; fuels
#       criticism from senior kin and helps explain the slide into land-poverty.
#     scene: He procrastinates on repairs and planting preparations until others press
#       him; fields may be weeded late unless a wife/kin organizes the work, and he
#       misplaces tools or forgets small obligations.
#     timing: adolescence onward (ages 14-50)
#     trait: Low Conscientiousness (15th percentile)
#   - consequence: Fewer allies in disputes and weaker access to cooperative labor beyond
#       close kin; increases reliance on household rather than wider social networks.
#     scene: At gatherings he sits at the edge, speaks little, and avoids boasting contests;
#       he prefers solitary tasks like fence-mending, bird-scaring, or early-morning
#       field checks.
#     timing: all life phases, strongest ages 12-45
#     trait: Low Extraversion (19th percentile)
#   - consequence: Limits initiative (interacting with low conscientiousness), strains
#       marital relations, and makes him less able to recover socially/economically
#       after losses.
#     scene: After repeated child deaths and poor seasons he moves slowly, sleeps poorly,
#       and shows reduced interest in music/dance and in the satisfaction of a good
#       harvest; he is functional but emotionally flat for long stretches.
#     timing: onset late teens; recurrent/persistent across adulthood (ages 17-64)
#     trait: Depressive disorder (persistent low mood/anhedonia)
# number_of_children: '6'
# number_of_siblings: '4'
# occupation: 'Subsistence/mixed-crop farmer (primary identity: cultivator; seasonal
#   fieldwork, food production)'

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During the hungry season, someone cut the fence to his family’s field at
#     night and stripped several ridges of ripening millet/sorghum, leaving him short
#     on food and seed for the next planting.
#   reasoning: Theft of crops, livestock, tools, or stored food was common enough in
#     small settlements and markets; his lower adult standing suggests some vulnerability
#     to losses and exploitation.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: late 30s (around ages 36–39)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: One of his wives became chronically weak with bouts of fever and wasting,
#     and he and his older children spent months fetching water and firewood, preparing
#     thin porridge, and seeking herbal treatments from a local healer until she eventually
#     died.
#   reasoning: Kin-compound living and limited specialist care meant families provided
#     most long-term care; as an older man and later widower, he likely had periods
#     of supporting an ill spouse/child/close kin.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 50s (around ages 50–54)
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: As a young man before bridewealth was fully assembled, he had a secret sexual
#     relationship with an unmarried girl from a neighboring compound during visits
#     to evening dances/beer gatherings, kept quiet to avoid sanctions.
#   reasoning: In many agrarian societies, premarital sexual activity occurred at meaningful
#     rates despite norms favoring controlled courtship; low conscientiousness slightly
#     increases likelihood.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late teens (around ages 17–19)
#   type: premarital_sex
# - event: While traveling to a periodic market a few days away to exchange grain and
#     dried goods, he began an affair with a married woman there, meeting when her husband
#     was away and giving her small gifts of food and cloth.
#   reasoning: Even with polygyny, extramarital relations happened (travel, markets,
#     marital conflict, fertility issues); high honesty-humility reduces but does not
#     preclude it over decades.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 40s (around ages 41–44)

Bènjiri was born in April of 1111 in the grassland and wooded mosaic of what is now southern Kaduna. His people lived in small farming settlements linked by kin ties and marriage, speaking a Benue–Congo language of the Plateau and Kainji belt. Authority sat close to the ground: elders, lineage heads, and the compound’s senior men. To the north, towns tied into Sahel trade and Islamic learning; in Bènjiri’s country those influences arrived as goods at markets, strangers passing through, and rumors of distant rulers.

He grew up inside a large patrilineal compound. His father farmed mixed crops, and his mother split her days between weeding, gathering fuel, pounding grain, cooking, and minding children. The compound held more than one hearth. Older men decided where new fields would be cleared and who would borrow seed. Women moved between cooking places and grinding stones. Goats wandered. Children carried water in small pots before they were strong enough for larger ones.

Bènjiri came second among five children. Gómbara, born three years before him, acted like an extra parent once he could lift a hoe. Túkoro, three years younger, chased older boys and tried to talk his way into their games. Their youngest brother died the year he was born, in 1117, and Bènjiri remembered the wailing, the washing of the small body, and the way adults spoke more softly for days afterward. Their sister Lángiri arrived in 1120 and, as she grew, learned to balance loads on her head before she could reach the tallest grain stores.

As a child, Bènjiri listened more than he spoke. He stayed close when elders argued about boundaries or who owed a day’s labor. Later, he repeated the words back with exactness, down to the order of names. When a granary jar was opened, he counted the scoops as they were poured and corrected boys who exaggerated what they had carried. He avoided the teasing games that drew crowds, but he liked the quiet satisfaction of shaping a straight line of ridges with his hoe. He rose early and sat on the hard-packed earth near the compound entrance, chewing roasted groundnuts when they were available and watching the light change before the first work began.

In his teens he took on heavier tasks: clearing brush, setting small controlled burns, repairing fences, and guarding ripening grain against birds. He worked well when he could focus on one job. He faltered when there were many small obligations at once. A hoe might be left out after dusk. A promised visit to help a cousin mend a roof might be forgotten until the cousin arrived angry. When rebuked, he did not argue. He went quiet and moved more slowly for days.

At seventeen and eighteen, when youth gathered at evening dances and beer drinking, he started meeting a girl from a neighboring compound. Her name stayed inside the two households; he never spoke it in front of older men. They met behind stacked firewood or at the edge of cleared ground after the dancing ended. The relationship ended when her family arranged her marriage elsewhere and Bènjiri’s own bridewealth negotiations became serious. He carried the memory as something that did not fit with the order of his elders’ rules. It returned in the quiet hours of the night.

In 1131, at twenty, he married Sàkuma. The marriage brought new work. He had to provide, negotiate, and respond quickly to quarrels between households. Those demands did not sit easily on him. When Sàkuma asked for more salt or a better pot, he delayed until she pressed him again. Still, he treated her fairly in the small things: he did not take the best pieces of meat first, and he did not claim more grain than was agreed when work was divided.

A few years after the marriage, Bènjiri moved a short distance to a nearby settlement where kin had rights to fields. The move followed a dispute over land use and a series of mediocre harvests. The new place kept the same language, the same ancestor rites, and the same seasonal rhythm. It also put him closer to a periodic market that had grown busier as trade links between the Sahel and the forest edge strengthened. Salt, iron tools, and cloth came in more regularly. Travelers spoke Hausa and other tongues. A few carried leather pouches with written charms, and some people paid for them.

In 1140, at twenty-nine, he took a second wife, Nàmari. Two cooking places now operated under his name. The arrangement created more labor and more arguments. Nàmari demanded quicker decisions; Sàkuma resented gifts that seemed uneven. Bènjiri settled disputes by measuring, counting, and repeating prior agreements, not by soothing words. Sometimes it worked. Sometimes both women turned away, and he let the silence stretch rather than chase reconciliation.

His children arrived over two decades. His first son was born in 1133, then a second in 1136, and a third in 1142. A daughter was born and died the same day in 1147. Another son was born and died in 1150. His youngest daughter arrived in 1153. Bènjiri did not speak much about the infants who died, but he kept their small bracelets and cords in a covered pot near the family shrine. He poured libations there with a steady hand.

In his late thirties, around 1149, during the hungry season before harvest, someone cut the fence to his field at night. Several ridges of ripening millet and sorghum were stripped. He found the damage at dawn, walking the field edge with his jaw clenched. He did not shout or gather a crowd. He tracked footprints to where they merged with other marks and stopped. The loss meant less food and less seed. He borrowed from kin and owed labor in return, and the debt put him under another man’s voice for longer than he accepted easily. Gómbara, now a senior figure, lectured him about guarding and preparation. Bènjiri listened and nodded, then forgot one of the promised repairs the next week, reigniting the argument.

Market trips increased as trade strengthened. In his early forties, between 1152 and 1155, he traveled for a periodic market a few days away, carrying grain and dried goods. There he began meeting Mbakíri, a married woman who sold prepared foods and small items. He gave her bits of cloth and extra grain. They met when her husband was away. The affair lasted seasons, not years. It added risk he did not manage well. He became watchful, tense at gatherings, and less willing to speak when questioned. At home, he sat longer at dawn, staring at the ground until work forced him to move.

Death and illness tightened the household. His eldest son died in 1146 at thirteen. His third son died in 1163 at twenty-one. His youngest daughter died in 1162 at nine. Each loss reduced labor and shifted obligations. Bènjiri’s mood stayed low for long stretches. He skipped dances. He avoided joking contests. When others laughed, he watched and forced a short smile, then returned to work. The one place he spoke freely was with Túkoro, his younger brother, who teased him about taking life too seriously and sometimes managed to get him to laugh, especially when they roasted yams and argued over whose ridges were straighter. Túkoro died in 1162, and that small refuge ended.

In his early fifties, around 1161 to 1165, Sàkuma became chronically ill. Fevers came in bouts. She lost weight and strength. Bènjiri and the older children fetched water and firewood, cooked thin porridge, and kept her clean. He took her to Kpángo, a local healer and diviner, and paid with grain and a goat. Kpángo gave herbs, instructed offerings, and named taboos for the household. Bènjiri followed the instructions exactly, marking days and measures with care. Sàkuma died in 1164.

Nàmari lived longer but did not thrive. The household had less land, less surplus, and more obligations. Their second son, Núnkali, reached adulthood and carried much of the farm work. When Nàmari died in 1170, Bènjiri did not take another wife. He moved into the household of adult children and close relatives, living as a widower and elder. He attended ancestor offerings and funerals, and he could still recite boundary histories and old agreements without error. He no longer managed the pacing of farm tasks; others decided and he followed.

In August 1175, at sixty-four, an acute fever struck him. He lay on a sleeping mat in the compound, spoke little, drank what water he could, and could not stand without help. On August 13, 1175, he died.
