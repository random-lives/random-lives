#     key_events:
#     - Raised in a multi-hearth compound under father’s and senior male kin authority;
#       learns routines of clearing, sowing, bird-scaring, and storage.
#     - Infant brother dies (1117); funeral and ancestor rites form early memories of
#       household spirituality.
#     - Shows early quickness with counting stores/seed and remembering boundary markers,
#       noticed by elders.
#     phase: Early childhood in extended patrilineal compound
#   - age_range: 7-19
#     key_events:
#     - Takes on heavier farm tasks; quiet temperament means he’s reliable in solitary
#       work (guarding fields, repairing fences) but not a leader in youth groups.
#     - Begins persistent low mood in adolescence (anhedonia, withdrawal), partly following
#       hard seasons and family stresses; still functions under kin supervision.
#     - Premarital relationship kept discreet during dance/beer gatherings while bridewealth
#       is being assembled.
#     phase: Later childhood and adolescence
#   - age_range: 20-34
#     key_events:
#     - Marries first wife (1131) and later migrates a short distance to a nearby settlement/land
#       patch, likely after a dispute or to access fields through kin ties.
#     - Second wife taken around 1140 when things look stable; polygynous household
#       forms with separate hearth routines.
#     - Expansion of periodic markets becomes more noticeable; occasional trips to exchange
#       grain for salt/iron/cloth.
#     phase: 'Young adulthood: marriage, household formation, short-distance move'
#   - age_range: 35-49
#     key_events:
#     - Victim of field theft in hungry season; seed shortage forces borrowing/obligations
#       and deepens dependence on senior kin.
#     - Extramarital affair during market travel; creates risk of conflict and contributes
#       to internal guilt/shame given high honesty-humility.
#     - Deaths of children/young adults and accumulation of obligations contribute to
#       becoming land-poor and less influential than birth household.
#     phase: 'Midlife: strain, status decline, and moral reputation'
#   - age_range: 50-64
#     key_events:
#     - Provides prolonged care for chronically ill first wife (early 50s) with older
#       children; she dies, followed by second wife a few years later.
#     - Lives as a widower/elder in an adult child’s or close relative’s household;
#       participates in ancestor offerings but with reduced vigor.
#     - Dies in 1175 during an acute febrile illness after a short course (malaria-like).

#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Gains a reputation for being 'clear-headed' and trustworthy, which
#       brings requests for help—but not necessarily higher status because he avoids
#       leadership roles.
#     scene: He’s the one who remembers exact field boundaries, storage-pot counts,
#       and the sequence of planting tasks; elders rely on him to settle small disputes
#       by recounting who planted what and when.
#     timing: childhood through midlife (ages 10-45)
#     trait: Intelligence (93rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Community trusts him with sensitive tasks, but his reluctance to
#       exploit others may leave him worse off during economic strain.
#     scene: When dividing grain or allocating labor, he avoids taking the better share
#       and resists opportunistic theft/cheating even during shortage; he returns a
#       mislaid market item rather than keeping it.
#     timing: adulthood (ages 20-60)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (91st percentile)
#   - consequence: Contributes to mediocre yields and vulnerability to setbacks; fuels
#       criticism from senior kin and helps explain the slide into land-poverty.
#     scene: He procrastinates on repairs and planting preparations until others press
#       him; fields may be weeded late unless a wife/kin organizes the work, and he
#       misplaces tools or forgets small obligations.
#     timing: adolescence onward (ages 14-50)
#     trait: Low Conscientiousness (15th percentile)
#   - consequence: Fewer allies in disputes and weaker access to cooperative labor beyond
#       close kin; increases reliance on household rather than wider social networks.
#     scene: At gatherings he sits at the edge, speaks little, and avoids boasting contests;
#       he prefers solitary tasks like fence-mending, bird-scaring, or early-morning
#       field checks.
#     timing: all life phases, strongest ages 12-45
#     trait: Low Extraversion (19th percentile)
#   - consequence: Limits initiative (interacting with low conscientiousness), strains
#       marital relations, and makes him less able to recover socially/economically
#       after losses.
#     scene: After repeated child deaths and poor seasons he moves slowly, sleeps poorly,
#       and shows reduced interest in music/dance and in the satisfaction of a good
#       harvest; he is functional but emotionally flat for long stretches.
#     timing: onset late teens; recurrent/persistent across adulthood (ages 17-64)
#     trait: Depressive disorder (persistent low mood/anhedonia)
# number_of_children: '6'
# number_of_siblings: '4'
# occupation: 'Subsistence/mixed-crop farmer (primary identity: cultivator; seasonal
#   fieldwork, food production)'
# religion: Household & lineage ancestor veneration (regular offerings at family shrines;
#   libations/food; naming and funeral rites)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During the hungry season, someone cut the fence to his family’s field at
#     night and stripped several ridges of ripening millet/sorghum, leaving him short
#     on food and seed for the next planting.
#   reasoning: Theft of crops, livestock, tools, or stored food was common enough in
#     small settlements and markets; his lower adult standing suggests some vulnerability
#     to losses and exploitation.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: late 30s (around ages 36–39)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: One of his wives became chronically weak with bouts of fever and wasting,
#     and he and his older children spent months fetching water and firewood, preparing
#     thin porridge, and seeking herbal treatments from a local healer until she eventually
#     died.
#   reasoning: Kin-compound living and limited specialist care meant families provided
#     most long-term care; as an older man and later widower, he likely had periods
#     of supporting an ill spouse/child/close kin.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 50s (around ages 50–54)
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: As a young man before bridewealth was fully assembled, he had a secret sexual
#     relationship with an unmarried girl from a neighboring compound during visits
#     to evening dances/beer gatherings, kept quiet to avoid sanctions.
#   reasoning: In many agrarian societies, premarital sexual activity occurred at meaningful
#     rates despite norms favoring controlled courtship; low conscientiousness slightly
#     increases likelihood.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late teens (around ages 17–19)
#   type: premarital_sex
# - event: While traveling to a periodic market a few days away to exchange grain and
#     dried goods, he began an affair with a married woman there, meeting when her husband
#     was away and giving her small gifts of food and cloth.
#   reasoning: Even with polygyny, extramarital relations happened (travel, markets,
#     marital conflict, fertility issues); high honesty-humility reduces but does not
#     preclude it over decades.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 40s (around ages 41–44)

Bènjiri was born on April 8, 1111, in a farming settlement on the high savanna of what is now southern Kaduna. His people spoke a local Benue–Congo tongue and organized their lives around patrilineal kin. Authority sat with senior men of the lineage, and disputes were settled in talk under shade, not in documents. North of them, Hausa towns and other Sahel markets pulled salt, iron, and cloth along routes that reached even small villages by way of periodic markets.

He entered a compound that already held many cooking fires. His father farmed mixed crops on ridged fields—millet and sorghum, with other foods grown in smaller patches—and his mother kept her own work rhythm: weeding, harvesting, pounding grain, carrying water, and feeding children. Bènjiri was the second of five. Gómbara, born in 1108, stood above him in age and spoke with the ease of an elder even as a boy. After Bènjiri came Túkoro in 1114, then a baby brother in 1117 who died before the rains turned, and then Lángiri in 1120.

The compound’s days had a pattern. Before the sun climbed, Bènjiri followed older boys to the fields with hoes and small bundles of food. In the afternoons, when heat pressed down, he stayed near the granaries, mending a broken fence stake or watching for goats nosing into stored sheaves. He avoided the loudest groups. When boys argued over who had cut straighter ridges, he drifted to the edge and worked with his hands. Elders noticed something else. He kept track of things without effort: which store pot had been opened, how many calabashes of grain remained after a meal, where a boundary stone sat when grass grew tall. When men argued after harvest, he could recount the order of workdays and who had helped on which plot.

Hard news came early. The infant brother died in 1117 and was carried out for burial with the rites of the lineage. Bènjiri’s mother kept a small place in the household shrine for remembrance, with food set aside at certain times. The dead were part of the house’s order, and a child learned that alongside planting and storage.

By seven or eight he was guarding ridges from birds with a sling and a bundle of pebbles. Later he helped clear new land where brush met grass, dragging branches to burn when the air turned dry. He did not seek the center of gatherings, but he listened. When older boys mocked a younger cousin for clumsy hoe work, Bènjiri told them to stop and then left, unwilling to keep arguing.

In the late 1120s the village youths met at evening dances and beer gatherings after heavy work. At seventeen, Bènjiri began slipping away to meet an unmarried girl from a neighboring compound. They met behind a granary wall or along the path where the bush thickened. He brought her a roasted ear of grain, once a strip of smoked meat, and kept the meetings quiet. Bridewealth for him had not been fully assembled. He watched his father and Gómbara negotiate with kin, counting out what could be spared. The secrecy sat in him after the meetings ended. He did not boast to friends about it. When others joked in the morning, he kept his face still and went back to the fields.

He married at twenty in 1131. His first wife, Sàkuma, came from nearby kin, and her arrival changed the compound’s work. She set up her own cooking place and stored her pots. Bènjiri did not become a loud household head. He rose early, checked the field edges, and returned with small notes of what needed doing, leaving others to press him into action. His father and older brother still pushed the larger schedule: when to repair the outer fence, when to send boys to scare birds, when to move stored grain to safer pots.

Not long after, he shifted residence a short distance, into another settlement within the same language region. It came after a dispute over a plot boundary that Gómbara settled without taking Bènjiri’s side. Bènjiri moved to land offered through kin ties, not far—close enough that visits still happened on market days and during rituals. He was thirty when he took a second wife, Nàmari, in 1140. For a few years the household felt secure enough. Two hearths, more hands, more ridges planted.

Children came quickly. A son was born in 1133, then another in 1136. A third son arrived in 1142. Two infants died in 1147 and 1150. In 1153 a daughter was born, small but vigorous. Bènjiri held babies awkwardly and handed them back fast, then returned to the work of making food appear. He took satisfaction in the quiet hours just after dawn, when dew still lay on grass and the fields were his alone for a short time. He liked thick porridge with ground seeds when it could be spared. He kept a habit of sitting on a low stool at the edge of the compound after the evening meal, turning a damaged hoe handle in his hands, smoothing it, putting it down, picking it up again.

Markets began to matter more as he aged. Between his mid-twenties and late fifties, periodic markets became busier. Salt arrived more regularly. Iron tools and small bits of cloth came through hands that had traveled from farther north. Bènjiri went with other men every so often, carrying a small load of grain or dried goods. He did not bargain with flair. He counted carefully and refused to cheat a seller even when he could have, and people asked him to witness exchanges because he repeated the terms exactly.

At thirteen, his eldest son died in 1146. The boy had been useful, quick to chase goats from stored sheaves, and old enough to help in field guarding. After the burial, Bènjiri moved through days slowly. He still worked, but without eagerness. When others told stories at night, he sat close enough to hear and then left before laughter peaked. Sàkuma scolded him for letting weeds thicken; he accepted the words without answering and then failed to change.

In 1149, when he was thirty-eight, a theft hit during the hungry season. Someone cut the fence at night and stripped several ridges of ripening millet and sorghum. The morning light showed trampled stems and bare heads. Bènjiri walked the ridges without shouting. He checked footprints, then stopped. The loss meant less food and, worse, less seed. He borrowed to plant the next season, taking obligations he disliked and could not easily repay. From that point his household stood lower than the one he had been born into. He did more work for senior kin, accepted smaller shares, and lost voice in arguments about land.

When he was forty-two, on a trip to a market a few days’ travel away, he began meeting Mbakíri, a married woman whose husband was often away. They met behind her compound when it was quiet. He gave her small gifts—grain, a strip of cloth—and left before dawn. The meetings continued through ages forty-one to forty-four. He did not laugh about it with companions. He returned home more withdrawn, irritable with small noise, and sometimes sat out work he should have done. Nàmari noticed, and tension sat between the two hearths.

Túkoro, his younger brother, died in 1162 at forty-eight, the same year Bènjiri’s nine-year-old daughter died. That year tightened his chest and slowed him further. The next year, in 1163, his third son died at twenty-one. Labor fell away. Debts and obligations did not. He leaned more on his second son, born in 1136, who carried the heavier tasks with a steadier temper.

In 1163 or 1164, Sàkuma became chronically ill. Fever came in bouts, then periods of weakness and wasting. Bènjiri and the older children fetched water and firewood, cooked thin porridge, and stayed near her mat at night when she could not rise. They visited Kpángo, a healer and diviner, who gave herbs and instructions and asked for offerings. The care stretched over months. Sàkuma died in 1164, when Bènjiri was fifty-three.

Nàmari died in 1170. By then Bènjiri lived as a widower, housed with his adult son Núnkali and other kin. Gómbara, now the senior brother, visited and spoke as if he still held authority over Bènjiri’s choices. Bènjiri answered briefly, then took his place near the household shrine when offerings were made, hands steady, face flat.

In August 1175 an acute fever took him quickly. He stopped going to the fields. Water was brought to him; he drank little. On August 13, 1175, at sixty-four years old, Bènjiri died in the compound where his son housed him, with lineage rites carried out the same day.
