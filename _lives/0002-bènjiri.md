#     - Shows early quickness with counting stores/seed and remembering boundary markers,
#       noticed by elders.
#     phase: Early childhood in extended patrilineal compound
#   - age_range: 7-19
#     key_events:
#     - Takes on heavier farm tasks; quiet temperament means he’s reliable in solitary
#       work (guarding fields, repairing fences) but not a leader in youth groups.
#     - Begins persistent low mood in adolescence (anhedonia, withdrawal), partly following
#       hard seasons and family stresses; still functions under kin supervision.
#     - Premarital relationship kept discreet during dance/beer gatherings while bridewealth
#       is being assembled.
#     phase: Later childhood and adolescence
#   - age_range: 20-34
#     key_events:
#     - Marries first wife (1131) and later migrates a short distance to a nearby settlement/land
#       patch, likely after a dispute or to access fields through kin ties.
#     - Second wife taken around 1140 when things look stable; polygynous household
#       forms with separate hearth routines.
#     - Expansion of periodic markets becomes more noticeable; occasional trips to exchange
#       grain for salt/iron/cloth.
#     phase: 'Young adulthood: marriage, household formation, short-distance move'
#   - age_range: 35-49
#     key_events:
#     - Victim of field theft in hungry season; seed shortage forces borrowing/obligations
#       and deepens dependence on senior kin.
#     - Extramarital affair during market travel; creates risk of conflict and contributes
#       to internal guilt/shame given high honesty-humility.
#     - Deaths of children/young adults and accumulation of obligations contribute to
#       becoming land-poor and less influential than birth household.
#     phase: 'Midlife: strain, status decline, and moral reputation'
#   - age_range: 50-64
#     key_events:
#     - Provides prolonged care for chronically ill first wife (early 50s) with older
#       children; she dies, followed by second wife a few years later.

#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Gains a reputation for being 'clear-headed' and trustworthy, which
#       brings requests for help—but not necessarily higher status because he avoids
#       leadership roles.
#     scene: He’s the one who remembers exact field boundaries, storage-pot counts,
#       and the sequence of planting tasks; elders rely on him to settle small disputes
#       by recounting who planted what and when.
#     timing: childhood through midlife (ages 10-45)
#     trait: Intelligence (93rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Community trusts him with sensitive tasks, but his reluctance to
#       exploit others may leave him worse off during economic strain.
#     scene: When dividing grain or allocating labor, he avoids taking the better share
#       and resists opportunistic theft/cheating even during shortage; he returns a
#       mislaid market item rather than keeping it.
#     timing: adulthood (ages 20-60)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (91st percentile)
#   - consequence: Contributes to mediocre yields and vulnerability to setbacks; fuels
#       criticism from senior kin and helps explain the slide into land-poverty.
#     scene: He procrastinates on repairs and planting preparations until others press
#       him; fields may be weeded late unless a wife/kin organizes the work, and he
#       misplaces tools or forgets small obligations.
#     timing: adolescence onward (ages 14-50)
#     trait: Low Conscientiousness (15th percentile)
#   - consequence: Fewer allies in disputes and weaker access to cooperative labor beyond
#       close kin; increases reliance on household rather than wider social networks.
#     scene: At gatherings he sits at the edge, speaks little, and avoids boasting contests;
#       he prefers solitary tasks like fence-mending, bird-scaring, or early-morning
#       field checks.
#     timing: all life phases, strongest ages 12-45
#     trait: Low Extraversion (19th percentile)
#   - consequence: Limits initiative (interacting with low conscientiousness), strains
#       marital relations, and makes him less able to recover socially/economically
#       after losses.
#     scene: After repeated child deaths and poor seasons he moves slowly, sleeps poorly,
#       and shows reduced interest in music/dance and in the satisfaction of a good
#       harvest; he is functional but emotionally flat for long stretches.
#     timing: onset late teens; recurrent/persistent across adulthood (ages 17-64)
#     trait: Depressive disorder (persistent low mood/anhedonia)
# number_of_children: '6'
# number_of_siblings: '4'
# occupation: 'Subsistence/mixed-crop farmer (primary identity: cultivator; seasonal
#   fieldwork, food production)'

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During the hungry season, someone cut the fence to his family’s field at
#     night and stripped several ridges of ripening millet/sorghum, leaving him short
#     on food and seed for the next planting.
#   reasoning: Theft of crops, livestock, tools, or stored food was common enough in
#     small settlements and markets; his lower adult standing suggests some vulnerability
#     to losses and exploitation.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: late 30s (around ages 36–39)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: One of his wives became chronically weak with bouts of fever and wasting,
#     and he and his older children spent months fetching water and firewood, preparing
#     thin porridge, and seeking herbal treatments from a local healer until she eventually
#     died.
#   reasoning: Kin-compound living and limited specialist care meant families provided
#     most long-term care; as an older man and later widower, he likely had periods
#     of supporting an ill spouse/child/close kin.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 50s (around ages 50–54)
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: As a young man before bridewealth was fully assembled, he had a secret sexual
#     relationship with an unmarried girl from a neighboring compound during visits
#     to evening dances/beer gatherings, kept quiet to avoid sanctions.
#   reasoning: In many agrarian societies, premarital sexual activity occurred at meaningful
#     rates despite norms favoring controlled courtship; low conscientiousness slightly
#     increases likelihood.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late teens (around ages 17–19)
#   type: premarital_sex
# - event: While traveling to a periodic market a few days away to exchange grain and
#     dried goods, he began an affair with a married woman there, meeting when her husband
#     was away and giving her small gifts of food and cloth.
#   reasoning: Even with polygyny, extramarital relations happened (travel, markets,
#     marital conflict, fertility issues); high honesty-humility reduces but does not
#     preclude it over decades.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 40s (around ages 41–44)

Bènjiri was born on April 8, 1111, in the rolling savanna south of the main northern trade towns, in what is now southern Kaduna. His people lived in small farming settlements linked by marriage and lineage, speaking a Benue–Congo tongue of the Plateau–Kainji kind. Authority sat with senior men in the patrilineage and with the heads of compounds. Religious duty centered on household shrines where the ancestors received libations of millet beer and portions of food at planting, harvest, and burial. The ancestors watched. When rains came or failed, when children lived or died, people understood the dead had opinions about the living.

He grew up in a crowded compound of joined households. His father farmed mixed crops, setting the rhythm with clearing and burning at the end of the dry season, then planting when the rains came. His mother kept her own plots and did the daily work that never waited: pounding grain, boiling porridge, drying vegetables, carrying water, watching children. Bènjiri was the second child. His older brother Gómbara had been born three years before and already acted like a small adult by the time Bènjiri could walk. A younger brother, Túkoro, arrived when Bènjiri was three, and a younger sister, Lángiri, when he was nine. Between them, an infant brother lived only long enough to be wrapped and mourned. Bènjiri remembered the low voices, the quick grave, and how the elders poured drink at the family shrine before anyone returned to the cooking fires.

As a boy he preferred jobs that kept him away from the middle of people. He took goats out at first light and came back when shadows shortened. He liked the neatness of storage—knowing which pot held last season's grain and which held seed. When older boys argued over who had first rights to a small patch of land near a streambed, he could repeat the order of planting from the previous year and quiet the shouting. He spoke softly, but elders listened when he spoke because his words matched what they remembered.

He entered adolescence during years of uneven rain. In hard seasons, the compound ate thinner porridge and stretched stores with leaves and wild fruits. Bènjiri did his share, but he moved slowly even when pressed. When others made lists of tasks in their heads and chased them, he drifted between chores. His mother sent him back out to finish weeding he had left half-done. Gómbara scolded him for leaving a hoe where rain could rust it. Bènjiri did not answer back; he simply went quiet, and the quiet lasted.

By seventeen he had begun to withdraw from gatherings. He still attended evening dances and beer drinkings with age-mates, but he sat at the edge and watched the dancers rather than pushing into the circle. At eighteen he started meeting a girl from a neighboring compound after such gatherings, slipping behind the granaries or into the dark near the fence line. Bridewealth was not assembled, and the meetings stayed secret. He carried small gifts—dried meat once, a pinch of salt another time—then returned home before the elders began calling names in the dark. When talk of marriage negotiations reached his household, he stopped seeing her without explanation and avoided her relatives at the next market day.

He married Sàkuma at twenty. The arrangement moved through his father and senior kin, with contributions from his brothers and uncles. Sàkuma brought her cooking pots and a few personal ornaments, and she took a place by a hearth in the compound. Two years later their first son was born. The boy lived, and Bènjiri watched him learn to carry water in a small calabash. As more periodic markets formed along the routes between the Sahel and the forest edge, traders began appearing more regularly with salt, iron bits, and lengths of cloth. Bènjiri paid attention to measures and exchanges. He could hold in his head what a handful of grain should bring, and he disliked being cheated.

At twenty-four he moved his household a short distance to another settlement tied to his lineage. The move followed a dispute over field boundaries after a poor harvest. Gómbara, already a senior man in practice, pushed for Bènjiri to leave the argument behind and take a patch offered by kin near the new settlement. The relocation changed little in landscape—open grassland, scattered trees, fields carved into the red-brown soil—but it changed who watched him daily and who judged his work.

Sàkuma bore a second son, Núnkali, the following year. Bènjiri worked harder for a time. Then he slid back into delays. He waited too long to repair the field fence. He forgot a small obligation to help a kinsman that would have kept goodwill easy. Still, at twenty-nine, he took a second wife, Nàmari. Two hearths meant more hands, and for a time it seemed he would build a sturdy household. A third son arrived two years later. Bènjiri let others talk at meetings, but he could still be relied on to count seed, to plan how much to save, and to settle small disputes by memory.

Losses came in a cluster. His eldest son died at thirteen after a brief illness that left him thin and hot to the touch. Bènjiri went through the burial rites without complaint and brought offerings to the household shrine—beer poured on the ground, millet set in the offering pot—but afterward he stopped joining in singing at work. An infant daughter died the day she was born. A few seasons later, a son was born and died within days. Bènjiri kept going to the fields, but he stopped showing pleasure when the first millet heads appeared, and he slept poorly.

The hungry season hit hard when he was thirty-eight. One night someone cut the fence to his field and stripped several ridges of ripening sorghum and millet. In the morning he found broken stems and footprints pressed into the soft earth. He searched the paths and questioned a few men, but no one admitted anything. The loss left him short of both food and seed. He borrowed grain from a senior kinsman under terms that tightened around him: extra labor owed, smaller claims when disputes arose, fewer choices about where to plant. After that he spoke second at meetings instead of first, ate after others had filled their bowls, and found his opinion counted for less when arguments needed settling.

He began traveling more to a periodic market a few days away, carrying grain and dried goods to trade for salt and iron. That market had more strangers each year—men with different accents, cloth from farther north, and rumors of towns where Muslim traders prayed at set times. Bènjiri stayed with what he knew. He made his household offerings and kept the family shrine swept and fed, and he did not seek new gods.

At forty-two he began an affair with Mbakíri, a married woman near that market. He met her when her husband traveled, leaving small gifts of grain and a strip of cloth. The meetings brought risk. He watched for people who might report him back through kin networks, and he avoided boasting. Afterward he returned to his compound more withdrawn, quick to anger at small household complaints and then silent for days. He stopped the affair after three years, without explanation, after someone hinted at it during a market quarrel.

His younger brother Túkoro died at forty-eight, weakening the web of labor and obligation that kept households going. The following year Bènjiri's third son died at twenty-one, and his youngest daughter fell ill and died at nine. Bènjiri and his wives carried water and tried herbal infusions, and they brought small offerings at the household shrine. The child died anyway.

Sàkuma began to fail that same year: weeks of weakness, bouts of fever, and steady wasting. Bènjiri and his older children took on months of care. They fetched water at dawn, kept a small fire for thin porridge, and carried Sàkuma to sit in shade when she could no longer walk far. They consulted Kpángo, a local healer and diviner, who gave bitter preparations and instructions about offerings. Bènjiri followed the instructions exactly, measuring out grain for the ancestors even when stores were low. Sàkuma died before the next planting. He buried her with the rites owed to a wife and kept his face still through the mourning.

Nàmari remained, but the household had shrunk and the fields yielded less. She died seven years later, the same year Bènjiri's second son Núnkali reached thirty-four. By then Bènjiri lived as a widower and elder in a household run by adult kin. He rose early, sat near the cooking area, and repaired small things when asked. He still insisted that shares be divided fairly, even when it went against his own interest. Children sometimes teased him for counting too carefully, and once he snapped at them, then withdrew to sit alone by the edge of the fields until dusk.

During the rainy season of his sixty-fourth year, an acute fever took him. He had chills and shaking, then heat and confusion. Núnkali and other kin kept him under a shelter and gave water and thin gruel. He died that day, and his family carried him out for burial and made the offerings that marked his passing into the line of ancestors who watched over the compound.
