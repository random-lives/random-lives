#     key_events:
#     - Raised in a multi-hearth compound under father’s and senior male kin authority;
#       learns routines of clearing, sowing, bird-scaring, and storage.
#     - Infant brother dies (1117); funeral and ancestor rites form early memories of
#       household spirituality.
#     - Shows early quickness with counting stores/seed and remembering boundary markers,
#       noticed by elders.
#     phase: Early childhood in extended patrilineal compound
#   - age_range: 7-19
#     key_events:
#     - Takes on heavier farm tasks; quiet temperament means he’s reliable in solitary
#       work (guarding fields, repairing fences) but not a leader in youth groups.
#     - Begins persistent low mood in adolescence (anhedonia, withdrawal), partly following
#       hard seasons and family stresses; still functions under kin supervision.
#     - Premarital relationship kept discreet during dance/beer gatherings while bridewealth
#       is being assembled.
#     phase: Later childhood and adolescence
#   - age_range: 20-34
#     key_events:
#     - Marries first wife (1131) and later migrates a short distance to a nearby settlement/land
#       patch, likely after a dispute or to access fields through kin ties.
#     - Second wife taken around 1140 when things look stable; polygynous household
#       forms with separate hearth routines.
#     - Expansion of periodic markets becomes more noticeable; occasional trips to exchange
#       grain for salt/iron/cloth.
#     phase: 'Young adulthood: marriage, household formation, short-distance move'
#   - age_range: 35-49
#     key_events:
#     - Victim of field theft in hungry season; seed shortage forces borrowing/obligations
#       and deepens dependence on senior kin.
#     - Extramarital affair during market travel; creates risk of conflict and contributes
#       to internal guilt/shame given high honesty-humility.
#     - Deaths of children/young adults and accumulation of obligations contribute to
#       becoming land-poor and less influential than birth household.
#     phase: 'Midlife: strain, status decline, and moral reputation'
#   - age_range: 50-64
#     key_events:
#     - Provides prolonged care for chronically ill first wife (early 50s) with older
#       children; she dies, followed by second wife a few years later.
#     - Lives as a widower/elder in an adult child’s or close relative’s household;
#       participates in ancestor offerings but with reduced vigor.
#     - Dies in 1175 during an acute febrile illness after a short course (malaria-like).

#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Gains a reputation for being 'clear-headed' and trustworthy, which
#       brings requests for help—but not necessarily higher status because he avoids
#       leadership roles.
#     scene: He’s the one who remembers exact field boundaries, storage-pot counts,
#       and the sequence of planting tasks; elders rely on him to settle small disputes
#       by recounting who planted what and when.
#     timing: childhood through midlife (ages 10-45)
#     trait: Intelligence (93rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Community trusts him with sensitive tasks, but his reluctance to
#       exploit others may leave him worse off during economic strain.
#     scene: When dividing grain or allocating labor, he avoids taking the better share
#       and resists opportunistic theft/cheating even during shortage; he returns a
#       mislaid market item rather than keeping it.
#     timing: adulthood (ages 20-60)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (91st percentile)
#   - consequence: Contributes to mediocre yields and vulnerability to setbacks; fuels
#       criticism from senior kin and helps explain the slide into land-poverty.
#     scene: He procrastinates on repairs and planting preparations until others press
#       him; fields may be weeded late unless a wife/kin organizes the work, and he
#       misplaces tools or forgets small obligations.
#     timing: adolescence onward (ages 14-50)
#     trait: Low Conscientiousness (15th percentile)
#   - consequence: Fewer allies in disputes and weaker access to cooperative labor beyond
#       close kin; increases reliance on household rather than wider social networks.
#     scene: At gatherings he sits at the edge, speaks little, and avoids boasting contests;
#       he prefers solitary tasks like fence-mending, bird-scaring, or early-morning
#       field checks.
#     timing: all life phases, strongest ages 12-45
#     trait: Low Extraversion (19th percentile)
#   - consequence: Limits initiative (interacting with low conscientiousness), strains
#       marital relations, and makes him less able to recover socially/economically
#       after losses.
#     scene: After repeated child deaths and poor seasons he moves slowly, sleeps poorly,
#       and shows reduced interest in music/dance and in the satisfaction of a good
#       harvest; he is functional but emotionally flat for long stretches.
#     timing: onset late teens; recurrent/persistent across adulthood (ages 17-64)
#     trait: Depressive disorder (persistent low mood/anhedonia)
# number_of_children: '6'
# number_of_siblings: '4'
# occupation: 'Subsistence/mixed-crop farmer (primary identity: cultivator; seasonal
#   fieldwork, food production)'
# religion: Household & lineage ancestor veneration (regular offerings at family shrines;
#   libations/food; naming and funeral rites)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During the hungry season, someone cut the fence to his family’s field at
#     night and stripped several ridges of ripening millet/sorghum, leaving him short
#     on food and seed for the next planting.
#   reasoning: Theft of crops, livestock, tools, or stored food was common enough in
#     small settlements and markets; his lower adult standing suggests some vulnerability
#     to losses and exploitation.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: late 30s (around ages 36–39)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: One of his wives became chronically weak with bouts of fever and wasting,
#     and he and his older children spent months fetching water and firewood, preparing
#     thin porridge, and seeking herbal treatments from a local healer until she eventually
#     died.
#   reasoning: Kin-compound living and limited specialist care meant families provided
#     most long-term care; as an older man and later widower, he likely had periods
#     of supporting an ill spouse/child/close kin.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 50s (around ages 50–54)
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: As a young man before bridewealth was fully assembled, he had a secret sexual
#     relationship with an unmarried girl from a neighboring compound during visits
#     to evening dances/beer gatherings, kept quiet to avoid sanctions.
#   reasoning: In many agrarian societies, premarital sexual activity occurred at meaningful
#     rates despite norms favoring controlled courtship; low conscientiousness slightly
#     increases likelihood.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late teens (around ages 17–19)
#   type: premarital_sex
# - event: While traveling to a periodic market a few days away to exchange grain and
#     dried goods, he began an affair with a married woman there, meeting when her husband
#     was away and giving her small gifts of food and cloth.
#   reasoning: Even with polygyny, extramarital relations happened (travel, markets,
#     marital conflict, fertility issues); high honesty-humility reduces but does not
#     preclude it over decades.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 40s (around ages 41–44)

Bènjiri was born in 1111 in the rolling savanna country of what is now southern Kaduna, in a settlement of Benue–Congo-speaking farmers where authority sat with senior men of the patrilineage and disputes were settled inside the compound. North of them, towns tied to Sahel trade carried salt, cloth, and iron, and with those goods came new oaths and the names of distant teachers; Bènjiri’s people kept their own rites, feeding the ancestors at household shrines and asking them to guard the granaries and the wombs.

He grew up in an extended compound with several hearths. His father farmed mixed fields of millet and sorghum on land cleared with iron hoes and fire, and his mother spent her days weeding, pounding grain, cooking thick porridge, and carrying water back from the stream. The compound’s oldest child, Gómbara, was born in 1108 and carried himself as the next senior man even before he had a beard. Bènjiri came three years later, smaller and quieter, quick with counting and memory. When elders argued over whose goats had damaged a ridge or where a boundary tree had stood, Bènjiri could repeat the order of events and the names of witnesses without stumbling.

In 1117 the household buried an infant boy, the fourth child. The women washed the small body and wrapped it in cloth; men dug a grave close to the compound so the child would remain under the protection of the lineage. Bènjiri remembered the sound of his mother’s voice calling the dead child’s name in a low, repeating chant while she poured a little water onto the earth. Another sibling arrived in 1120, a sister named Lángiri, who later married out to a nearby settlement.

As a boy Bènjiri worked alone well. He liked the early morning, before talk began, when he could take a bundle of stakes to mend a fence or sit by the edge of the fields and throw stones at quelea birds. He avoided the loudest games and the boasting contests of older boys. At meals he ate steadily and without fuss, but he always saved the best roasted groundnuts for last. When the household set out a small clay pot at the family shrine—oil, a bit of flour, sometimes a piece of smoked meat—he watched the older men speak the names of the dead and touch the earth with their fingertips.

His younger brother Túkoro was born in 1114 and grew into a quick-talking, restless man who liked people and markets. Bènjiri never matched that pace. Through his teens his work came in fits. Some weeks he moved slowly, left tools where the rain could reach them, and let weeds climb higher than they should before he noticed. If someone pressed him, he did the job in a rush and then sat alone behind the granary, staring at nothing. When there was drumming in the evenings, he stood at the edge, listening, not joining the circle. Gómbara scolded him for that. Their father put tasks on him that had clear beginnings and ends: carry water, fetch firewood, watch the goats, mend the fence at the yam mound.

At seventeen, in 1128, he began slipping away to beer gatherings in a neighboring compound where young people met after work. There he took up with an unmarried girl whose family lived one ridge over. They met behind the cooking huts and in the tall grass beyond the last granary, and the relationship continued through the next rainy season. Bènjiri kept it quiet. He did not speak of it with his brothers, and when older women teased youths about secrets and swollen bellies he stared at the ground and said nothing. The affair ended when negotiations for his marriage began and the girl’s family pushed for her to be promised elsewhere.

In 1131, at twenty, Bènjiri married Sàkuma. Bridewealth moved in small steps—bundles of grain, a goat, iron tools—and Gómbara played the public part, speaking with the bride’s kin and arranging labor. Bènjiri moved into the routine of married life: early work in the fields, then repairs, then the evening meal by his hearth. When their first son was born in 1133, Bènjiri held the boy without celebration and then walked to the shrine to place a pinch of flour on the earth and murmur the names of the ancestors.

A few years later the region’s periodic markets grew busier. Men came with salt in small lumps and lengths of cloth with narrow woven patterns; smiths traded iron points and knives; strangers spoke of towns farther north where the call to prayer sounded at dawn. Bènjiri did not chase those connections, but he understood the exchange rates quickly and corrected Túkoro when his brother tried to trade too much grain for too little salt. In 1135 he made the short move that changed his household’s footing. A dispute over field boundaries and obligations with a senior kinsman ended with Bènjiri shifting his hearth and his wives to a nearby settlement where Lángiri’s husband had access to new land. The distance was a few days’ walk. It kept him inside his language community, but it placed him under other elders’ eyes.

In 1140 he took a second wife, Nàmari. With two hearths, his compound sounded different: more pots clanking, more quarrels over water and firewood, more laughter from the women when they teased each other. Bènjiri did not manage the new complexity well. He missed planting days unless someone reminded him. He forgot a promise to help a neighbor repair a roof and then tried to pay it back with a basket of grain, which the neighbor rejected. Still, in good years the granaries filled.

Loss came early and often. An infant daughter died on the day she was born in 1147. Three years later an infant son followed the same path, living only hours. In 1146 his eldest son, thirteen, fell sick after the rains and died within days. Bènjiri kept working, but something in him stayed quiet afterward. He stopped attending evening drumming altogether. When other men joked, he sometimes answered with a sharp, exact comment that ended the laughter, as if he could not find the line between play and insult.

In 1149, when he was thirty-eight, the hungry season bit hard. One morning he walked his field and saw the fence cut cleanly. Several ridges of millet and sorghum had been stripped in the night. He searched for footprints, found only scuffed earth, and went from compound to compound asking questions with a stiff face. No one admitted anything. The theft took away food and seed. He borrowed grain at unfavorable terms from a senior man and owed labor in return. After that year, people spoke less of him as a household head and more as someone who needed help.

Market travel gave him one place where he could step out of daily supervision. In 1153, at forty-two, he began an affair during trips to a periodic market a few days away. The woman’s name was Mbakíri, married to a man who traveled with caravans of small goods. Bènjiri met her when he brought grain and dried produce to exchange for salt and cloth. He started leaving small gifts—food, a strip of cloth, sometimes a little iron—and came to her compound when her husband was away. He said little during those meetings. Afterward he walked back to the guest hut and sat awake, troubled by his own actions.

Death tightened the household further. His third son, born in 1142, died at twenty-one in 1163, after a sudden illness that left him unable to stand. That loss removed a strong worker from the fields. Then the youngest surviving child, a daughter born in 1153, died at nine in 1162. The compound had fewer hands and more mouths to feed through obligations and debts.

In 1161, when Bènjiri was fifty, Sàkuma became chronically ill. She had bouts of fever and then long stretches of weakness, her weight dropping, her skin dry. Bènjiri’s older children fetched water and firewood; he sat near her hearth, stirring thin porridge and trying to get her to swallow. He took her to Kpángo, a local healer and diviner, who cast objects on a mat and spoke of offended spirits and neglected obligations. Bènjiri brought offerings to the household shrine—oil, flour, a chicken—speaking the ancestors’ names as he had heard them spoken. Sàkuma did not recover. She died in 1164, and Bènjiri organized the burial with little speech, directing where the grave would be dug and what food would be set aside for mourners.

Nàmari lasted longer, but fever returned to the compound in 1170 and took her as well. That same year Bènjiri’s second son, Núnkali, reached thirty-four and was already a father. Bènjiri moved into Núnkali’s household as an elder. He still walked to the fields some mornings and checked the fences, but he did not lead the work. He sat in the shade near the granary entrance, repairing a tool handle in slow strokes, listening to children argue over a calabash.

In August 1175, at sixty-four, he caught an acute fever. He lay on a mat in Núnkali’s compound, drinking water when it was offered and speaking little. The men prepared his body after death and buried him close to the compound; at the household shrine they poured a small libation of water and set a pinch of grain flour on the earth so his name could be added to the line of ancestors.
