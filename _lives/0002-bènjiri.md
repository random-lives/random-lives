#     - Infant brother dies (1117); funeral and ancestor rites form early memories of
#       household spirituality.
#     - Shows early quickness with counting stores/seed and remembering boundary markers,
#       noticed by elders.
#     phase: Early childhood in extended patrilineal compound
#   - age_range: 7-19
#     key_events:
#     - Takes on heavier farm tasks; quiet temperament means he’s reliable in solitary
#       work (guarding fields, repairing fences) but not a leader in youth groups.
#     - Begins persistent low mood in adolescence (anhedonia, withdrawal), partly following
#       hard seasons and family stresses; still functions under kin supervision.
#     - Premarital relationship kept discreet during dance/beer gatherings while bridewealth
#       is being assembled.
#     phase: Later childhood and adolescence
#   - age_range: 20-34
#     key_events:
#     - Marries first wife (1131) and later migrates a short distance to a nearby settlement/land
#       patch, likely after a dispute or to access fields through kin ties.
#     - Second wife taken around 1140 when things look stable; polygynous household
#       forms with separate hearth routines.
#     - Expansion of periodic markets becomes more noticeable; occasional trips to exchange
#       grain for salt/iron/cloth.
#     phase: 'Young adulthood: marriage, household formation, short-distance move'
#   - age_range: 35-49
#     key_events:
#     - Victim of field theft in hungry season; seed shortage forces borrowing/obligations
#       and deepens dependence on senior kin.
#     - Extramarital affair during market travel; creates risk of conflict and contributes
#       to internal guilt/shame given high honesty-humility.
#     - Deaths of children/young adults and accumulation of obligations contribute to
#       becoming land-poor and less influential than birth household.
#     phase: 'Midlife: strain, status decline, and moral reputation'
#   - age_range: 50-64
#     key_events:
#     - Provides prolonged care for chronically ill first wife (early 50s) with older
#       children; she dies, followed by second wife a few years later.
#     - Lives as a widower/elder in an adult child’s or close relative’s household;
#       participates in ancestor offerings but with reduced vigor.
#     - Dies in 1175 during an acute febrile illness after a short course (malaria-like).

#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Gains a reputation for being 'clear-headed' and trustworthy, which
#       brings requests for help—but not necessarily higher status because he avoids
#       leadership roles.
#     scene: He’s the one who remembers exact field boundaries, storage-pot counts,
#       and the sequence of planting tasks; elders rely on him to settle small disputes
#       by recounting who planted what and when.
#     timing: childhood through midlife (ages 10-45)
#     trait: Intelligence (93rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Community trusts him with sensitive tasks, but his reluctance to
#       exploit others may leave him worse off during economic strain.
#     scene: When dividing grain or allocating labor, he avoids taking the better share
#       and resists opportunistic theft/cheating even during shortage; he returns a
#       mislaid market item rather than keeping it.
#     timing: adulthood (ages 20-60)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (91st percentile)
#   - consequence: Contributes to mediocre yields and vulnerability to setbacks; fuels
#       criticism from senior kin and helps explain the slide into land-poverty.
#     scene: He procrastinates on repairs and planting preparations until others press
#       him; fields may be weeded late unless a wife/kin organizes the work, and he
#       misplaces tools or forgets small obligations.
#     timing: adolescence onward (ages 14-50)
#     trait: Low Conscientiousness (15th percentile)
#   - consequence: Fewer allies in disputes and weaker access to cooperative labor beyond
#       close kin; increases reliance on household rather than wider social networks.
#     scene: At gatherings he sits at the edge, speaks little, and avoids boasting contests;
#       he prefers solitary tasks like fence-mending, bird-scaring, or early-morning
#       field checks.
#     timing: all life phases, strongest ages 12-45
#     trait: Low Extraversion (19th percentile)
#   - consequence: Limits initiative (interacting with low conscientiousness), strains
#       marital relations, and makes him less able to recover socially/economically
#       after losses.
#     scene: After repeated child deaths and poor seasons he moves slowly, sleeps poorly,
#       and shows reduced interest in music/dance and in the satisfaction of a good
#       harvest; he is functional but emotionally flat for long stretches.
#     timing: onset late teens; recurrent/persistent across adulthood (ages 17-64)
#     trait: Depressive disorder (persistent low mood/anhedonia)
# number_of_children: '6'
# number_of_siblings: '4'
# occupation: 'Subsistence/mixed-crop farmer (primary identity: cultivator; seasonal
#   fieldwork, food production)'
# religion: Household & lineage ancestor veneration (regular offerings at family shrines;
#   libations/food; naming and funeral rites)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During the hungry season, someone cut the fence to his family’s field at
#     night and stripped several ridges of ripening millet/sorghum, leaving him short
#     on food and seed for the next planting.
#   reasoning: Theft of crops, livestock, tools, or stored food was common enough in
#     small settlements and markets; his lower adult standing suggests some vulnerability
#     to losses and exploitation.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: late 30s (around ages 36–39)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: One of his wives became chronically weak with bouts of fever and wasting,
#     and he and his older children spent months fetching water and firewood, preparing
#     thin porridge, and seeking herbal treatments from a local healer until she eventually
#     died.
#   reasoning: Kin-compound living and limited specialist care meant families provided
#     most long-term care; as an older man and later widower, he likely had periods
#     of supporting an ill spouse/child/close kin.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 50s (around ages 50–54)
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: As a young man before bridewealth was fully assembled, he had a secret sexual
#     relationship with an unmarried girl from a neighboring compound during visits
#     to evening dances/beer gatherings, kept quiet to avoid sanctions.
#   reasoning: In many agrarian societies, premarital sexual activity occurred at meaningful
#     rates despite norms favoring controlled courtship; low conscientiousness slightly
#     increases likelihood.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late teens (around ages 17–19)
#   type: premarital_sex
# - event: While traveling to a periodic market a few days away to exchange grain and
#     dried goods, he began an affair with a married woman there, meeting when her husband
#     was away and giving her small gifts of food and cloth.
#   reasoning: Even with polygyny, extramarital relations happened (travel, markets,
#     marital conflict, fertility issues); high honesty-humility reduces but does not
#     preclude it over decades.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: early 40s (around ages 41–44)

Bènjiri was born on April 8, 1111, in a farming settlement in the savanna mosaic of what is now southern Kaduna. His people spoke a Benue–Congo language and organized themselves by patrilineal kin groups living in compounds. No distant king’s officials came to measure their harvests. Authority sat closer: elders, lineage heads, and the rules enforced through oaths, compensation, and the pressure of relatives. Traders from farther north visited the larger markets with salt, iron, and cloth, and their routes grew busier as Bènjiri reached adulthood.

He entered a compound already full of voices. His father farmed mixed crops, and his mother’s days ran on weeding, pounding grain, cooking, and carrying water. An older brother, Gómbara, was three years ahead of him and already tagging after men to the fields. Behind Bènjiri came three more births: Túkoro in 1114, a baby boy in 1117 who died before he learned to sit, and a sister, Lángiri, in 1120.

Bènjiri’s earliest memories stayed close to the compound: smoke in the mornings, the scratch of sweep brooms on hard earth, and the sound of pestles from the women’s side. He learned to recognize seed grain by feel and smell. He counted storage pots with a seriousness that made his mother laugh once, then stop laughing when she realized he was right about a pot that had been left unsealed. When disputes rose over whose goats had entered whose patch, elders asked children what they had seen. Bènjiri answered in short sentences and did not change the order of events. That steadiness mattered.

The baby brother’s death in 1117 set one of the rhythms of his childhood: burial, a quiet stretch, then the household’s small offerings to ancestors and the return to planting. His mother told him later that the child had been named and mourned. Bènjiri listened without questions. Some days he sat behind the granary wall after work and stared at the ground until someone called him back.

As a boy he did not chase talk. Gómbara enjoyed standing where others could see him. Túkoro liked the bustle of the compound entrance, passing jokes with visitors. Bènjiri chose solitary tasks. He would take a slingshot to the field edge and spend long hours driving birds from millet heads. He avoided the noisy wrestling that other boys used to settle insults. When he did fight, he ended it quickly and then went quiet for days.

His father expected him to learn the year’s pattern: clearing after the dry season, planting with the first consistent rains, the long weeding, then guarding and harvest. Bènjiri understood the pattern but pushed chores to the last moment unless someone pressed him. He left a hoe where rain rusted it. He forgot a promised bundle of firewood for an elder, then brought two bundles the next day and said nothing. His father scolded him. Gómbara scolded him too, more sharply, because an older brother could.

By his late teens he carried a persistent dullness that did not lift with good food or a laugh at others’ jokes. He slept at odd hours and avoided the evening gatherings until a cousin dragged him. In 1129, when he was eighteen, he began meeting an unmarried girl from a neighboring compound during dance nights and beer gatherings. He did not boast to friends. He slipped away before the songs ended and returned by the dark side of the granaries. Bridewealth negotiations for his own marriage had started, and he feared the older men’s anger. The secrecy did not excite him. It left him tense and careful.

In 1131, at twenty, he married Sàkuma. The marriage tied households with gifts and obligations, and it brought new labor to the fields. Bènjiri built a small cooking area at the edge of the larger compound and worked his father’s land under the oversight of senior kin. Two years later, in 1133, Sàkuma bore a son. Bènjiri watched the baby’s hands open and close and felt a brief brightness. He named the child in the household way and made the small offerings expected at the family shrine.

He moved in 1134, not far—only a few days’ travel—to a settlement where a relative could grant access to fields. A dispute over field boundaries lay behind it, and Gómbara’s temper made the dispute harder to soften. The move kept Bènjiri within his language community, but it placed him outside the daily protection of his birth compound. He missed the predictable authority of elders, even when it had irritated him.

As markets grew more regular, Bènjiri began taking grain and dried goods to a periodic market and returning with salt, iron tools, and cloth. In 1140, when he was twenty-nine, he took a second wife, Nàmari. It fit the ambitions of a household that wanted more labor and more children. It also brought more quarrels over food and attention. Bènjiri disliked loud arguments and walked away from them. That avoidance solved nothing. Sàkuma accused him of letting Nàmari take more than her share. Nàmari accused him of letting Sàkuma’s relatives dictate terms.

Children came in a staggered line. A second son in 1136, then another in 1142. A daughter was born in 1147 and died the same day. In 1150, an infant son died soon after birth. The losses did not make Bènjiri louder in his grief. They made him slower. He began skipping the evening songs entirely, choosing instead to sit by the outer fence and pick at a reed mat while listening to the compound settle into sleep.

The first major blow to his household’s security came in 1149. He was thirty-eight. In the hungry season, someone cut the fence to his family’s field at night and stripped several ridges of ripening millet and sorghum. He found the damage in the morning, crouched over broken stalks, and said nothing until his eldest son noticed the empty ridges. The theft left him short on food and seed for the next planting. He borrowed grain from a senior kinsman under terms that tightened future obligations. It marked him as a man who could not fully protect what was his.

In 1153, a younger daughter was born. She lived, and Bènjiri found he enjoyed her company more than he expected. He liked taking her in the early morning to check traps for small game and to shake dew from leaves before the sun rose. She laughed at the sound of guinea fowl. He did not.

In 1153 and 1154, trade at the periodic market thickened. People carried new cloth, and iron points came more regularly. In 1153, when he was forty-two, Bènjiri began an affair with a married woman at that market, Mbakíri. They met when her husband was away. He brought small gifts: a twist of salt, a strip of cloth, a little grain. He did not brag. The meetings left him with a heavy caution that showed in the way he watched paths on his walk home.

His oldest son died in 1146 at thirteen, but the hardest household labor loss came later. In 1162, Bènjiri’s younger brother Túkoro died at forty-eight. That same year Bènjiri’s youngest daughter died at nine after an illness that thinned her quickly. In 1163, his third son died at twenty-one, old enough to have carried the heaviest loads and young enough to leave plans unfinished. The compound’s labor shrank. The debts from earlier borrowing did not.

In 1163, Sàkuma’s health collapsed into long weakness with repeated bouts of fever and wasting. By 1164, Bènjiri was fifty-three and spending his days between field work and care. He and his older children fetched water and firewood, prepared thin porridge, and sat with her through long afternoons. They visited Kpángo, a healer and diviner, who provided herbs and instructed offerings. Bènjiri followed the instructions exactly, even when he felt no hope. Sàkuma died in 1164. He performed the required rites, focused on the correct steps, and did not speak to visitors more than necessary.

Nàmari lived longer, but not by much. She died in 1170, the same year Bènjiri’s second son reached thirty-four and took over more of the household’s decisions. Bènjiri, land-poor and tied by obligations, lived as a widower in his adult child’s household. He still went to the family shrine with small offerings and spoke the ancestor names without stumbling. He did not linger at gatherings. He spent mornings checking fences and then sitting in a shaded spot where he could see the path.

In August 1175, after days of rain and standing water near the fields, Bènjiri fell into an acute fever. He shook, stopped eating, and could not keep up with water. Relatives tried herbs and cool cloths. On August 13, 1175, at sixty-four, he died in the compound where his surviving family housed him.
