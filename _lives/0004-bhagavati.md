#   timing: teens through late 20s (c. 938–952)
# - event: Monsoon failure or weak rains causing a bad harvest in the rainfed Deccan

# structured_incidents:
# - event: After returning to her natal household and being sent to grind grain at a
#     patron’s compound, she quietly took small measures of millet and a bit of clarified
#     butter from the storehouse over several visits to feed herself and her surviving
#     daughter.
#   reasoning: Economic pressure after separation could lead to small-scale theft or
#     illicit taking (grain, cloth), but her natal-kin support and high honesty-humility
#     reduce the likelihood of deliberate property crime.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: around ages 24–26
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime
# - event: While working as an attendant in a higher-status household, a male relative
#     of the householder coerced her into sex in a back room by threatening to have
#     her turned out and accusing her of theft.
#   reasoning: Given marital separation, variable dependence on kin/patrons, and endemic
#     coercion with limited recourse, the chance that her experienced violence included
#     sexual coercion/assault is fairly high.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: around ages 22–23
#   type: sexual_violence
# - event: During her marriage, her husband beat her with a stick and kicked her after
#     disputes over dowry and her failure to produce a surviving son, and she eventually
#     fled back to her father’s house.
#   reasoning: In this setting, violence by a husband or other household authority figure
#     was common and is a plausible contributor to separation/return to natal kin.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: around ages 18–21
#   type: domestic_violence
# - event: After separation, she entered a secret ongoing liaison with a man connected
#     to the patron’s household, exchanging sex for regular grain and protection while
#     she lacked a stable marital home.
#   reasoning: After abandonment/separation, any subsequent sexual relationship (consensual
#     or coerced but repeated) would be categorized as outside marriage, making this
#     a leading pathway to 'nonstandard' history.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: around ages 22–24
#   type: extramarital_sex
# - event: One pregnancy ended in a late miscarriage after days of fever and bleeding;
#     older women treated her with hot compresses, herbal decoctions, and ritual vows
#     at the village goddess shrine.
#   reasoning: Repeated pregnancies in a high-mortality setting make miscarriage/stillbirth/serious
#     complication common; her two infants dying at age 0 also correlates with difficult
#     births or neonatal fragility.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: around age 25
#   type: pregnancy_complications

Bhagavati was born at the start of the hot season in 924, in a village on the dry plateau east of the larger Deccan routes, where people spoke a local Indo‑Aryan tongue descended from Maharashtri and prayed in the ways their mothers taught them. The land lay under the reach of the Rashtrakuta world, through layers of chiefs and revenue men. Orders arrived by messenger and seal, and the village headmen and their kin argued over how much grain and labor to send.

Her household stood above most of the village. They held better fields and had the right connections to speak for others when tax was demanded. Bhagavati grew up in her father’s compound with an elder above him—her father’s father—who sat on a low platform and listened to disputes. Her mother, Shashiprabha, ran the cooking place and the stores. She watched the jars. She measured grain with steady hands. She kept a brass lamp ready for the household shrine.

There were seven children in all. Bhagavati came late, the sixth. Before her, there were three older brothers—Vishnu, Dhanapala, and little Govinda, who died as an infant—then an older sister, Jaya, and then Bhagavati. A younger sister, Nandini, came after. The brothers fought with sticks, chased goats, and climbed the neem near the well. The girls carried water, swept, watched babies, and learned which leaves soothed a rash and which ones burned the tongue. Govinda’s death sat in the household’s rhythm: one more funeral meal served, one more set of vows taken at the village goddess’s stone.

Her father, Rudradeva, did not spend all his days in the fields. He wore a sword when he went out beyond the boundary stones. He rode with other men when a local chief demanded service. Sometimes he came back with a bruise on his shoulder and a pouch of salt or cloth taken as payment. Sometimes he came back angry because a messenger had brought new demands—grain, cattle, men to dig a ditch, men to stand watch on a road. In those weeks, Shashiprabha tightened the stores and sent the children to collect dry wood and dung cakes.

Bhagavati learned the work that could not wait. She rose when Shashiprabha rose. She helped grind millet on the stone, her wrists aching from the push and pull. She carried a sickle to cut fodder. She cleaned the cooking pots with ash. When her mother fasted for a vow, Bhagavati watched the younger children and kept the lamp lit. At the village shrine, she brought turmeric and flowers and a pinch of grain. She tied a thread at the goddess’s post when a child coughed too long.

A bad monsoon came when Bhagavati was still a child. The rains arrived weak and late. The millet heads stayed short. Men argued at the threshing floor about what would be kept and what would be paid. Grain prices rose in the market village. Rudradeva and his brothers began speaking in clipped voices. Shashiprabha started stretching the gruel with more water. Bhagavati saw women bring their bangles to a moneylender and leave with smaller wrists and a heavier look.

By her early teens, the household had arranged her marriage. The match linked them to another family with fields and fighting men. Her husband, Keshava, lived in a nearby settlement. The wedding was loud and crowded, and the food was counted carefully. Bhagavati left her natal courtyard and walked to Keshava’s house with women singing behind her. She brought what her family could provide: cloth, small ornaments, cooking vessels, promises. Keshava’s mother inspected everything.

Married life narrowed her days. The house held other women, older and sharper-tongued. Bhagavati cooked under their eyes and learned their rules. She kept her head down when men spoke. She scrubbed floors after meals and slept where she was told. Keshava wanted more from her family. When he returned from drinking with his friends or after speaking with his mother, he brought the argument into the courtyard. He hit her with a stick. He kicked her when she fell. He said her people had cheated him, and he said her body was failing him. The beatings came after long stretches of silence. Then they came more often.

She bore children. Two died at birth, one after another, small bodies washed and wrapped quickly. The household blamed her. The women spoke in a way meant to be heard. Keshava pressed her with his hands when she tried to move away. He demanded she ask her father for more. She sent messages back through travelers and kin. Rudradeva came once and spoke with Keshava and Keshava’s older brother, offering words and a small payment to quiet the demands. It did not end.

Bhagavati’s third child lived, a daughter named Kamala. The baby’s cry filled the room and did not stop after a day. Kamala held on. Bhagavati carried her on her hip while cooking and while fetching water. When Kamala began to walk, Bhagavati watched her feet on the uneven ground and kept her close to the wall so goats would not knock her over.

The pressure on the village households grew as Bhagavati entered her late teens. Men rode through demanding supplies for a local chief. Grain was counted again. Rudradeva’s household supplied men and food. Keshava spoke of leaving to serve a patron for a season. When he returned, he came back harder. He beat Bhagavati after an argument about Kamala’s future and about the lack of a living son. One morning after he struck her in the face and her mouth filled with blood, she gathered Kamala, a spare cloth, and a small bundle of grain, and walked out.

Her natal household took her in. Her grandfather still lived and listened without interrupting. Her brothers did not welcome the trouble, but they let her sleep in a corner of the women’s space. Shashiprabha washed her bruises and told her to keep her voice low. The village had its opinions. Bhagavati did not explain herself to everyone who asked. She stayed near the courtyard and did what work was put in front of her.

As Kamala grew, food became tighter. Another poor season strained households. Bhagavati’s brothers watched the stores and questioned every extra mouth. Shashiprabha sent Bhagavati to a higher-status compound where a patron’s women hired help for grinding and carrying water. Bhagavati went before dawn and returned late, hands rough with chaff.

In that compound, a male relative of the householder cornered her in a back room. He held her by the wrist and told her he would accuse her of stealing and have her thrown out. He forced her into sex, quiet and quick, and then stepped away as if he had taken nothing. Bhagavati went back to the grinding stone with her face set. She did not tell the women who paid her.

After that, another man attached to the same household offered what she needed in plain terms: grain, a little protection in the compound, a word to keep accusations from sticking. The price was his visits, timed when others were busy. Bhagavati accepted. She kept the arrangement hidden, even from her mother. She brought home millet in a folded cloth and told her brothers it was wages.

When the stores ran low and Kamala’s belly swelled with hunger, Bhagavati began taking more than wages. From the patron’s storehouse she slipped away small measures of millet and a bit of clarified butter. Not much at a time. Enough to thicken the gruel. She did it over several visits, careful about who watched the door.

At twenty-five, she became pregnant again. She carried water and worked through the early months. Then fever came, and bleeding. Older women pressed hot cloths to her belly and made her drink bitter decoctions. They took her to the village goddess shrine and tied a vow thread, promising offerings if the bleeding stopped. The pregnancy ended late, in pain and blood. The women washed her and burned what could be burned. She lay still for days, then rose and returned to work.

In 952, after the rains, the water in the village turned foul. Children passed loose stools and cried for water. Bhagavati began to empty herself, again and again, too fast for any remedy to matter. Shashiprabha tried rice water and salt. She tried boiled herbs. Kamala clung to her. Bhagavati’s mouth dried and her skin cooled. On the third day her body cramped and she could not stand. She died in the natal compound before the next morning meal was cooked, twenty-eight years old.
