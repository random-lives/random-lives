# structured_incidents:
# - event: After returning to her natal household and being sent to grind grain at a

#     daughter.
#   reasoning: Economic pressure after separation could lead to small-scale theft or
#     illicit taking (grain, cloth), but her natal-kin support and high honesty-humility
#     reduce the likelihood of deliberate property crime.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: around ages 24–26
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime
# - event: While working as an attendant in a higher-status household, a male relative
#     of the householder coerced her into sex in a back room by threatening to have
#     her turned out and accusing her of theft.
#   reasoning: Given marital separation, variable dependence on kin/patrons, and endemic
#     coercion with limited recourse, the chance that her experienced violence included
#     sexual coercion/assault is fairly high.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: around ages 22–23
#   type: sexual_violence
# - event: During her marriage, her husband beat her with a stick and kicked her after
#     disputes over dowry and her failure to produce a surviving son, and she eventually
#     fled back to her father’s house.
#   reasoning: In this setting, violence by a husband or other household authority figure
#     was common and is a plausible contributor to separation/return to natal kin.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: around ages 18–21
#   type: domestic_violence
# - event: After separation, she entered a secret ongoing liaison with a man connected
#     to the patron’s household, exchanging sex for regular grain and protection while
#     she lacked a stable marital home.
#   reasoning: After abandonment/separation, any subsequent sexual relationship (consensual
#     or coerced but repeated) would be categorized as outside marriage, making this
#     a leading pathway to 'nonstandard' history.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: around ages 22–24
#   type: extramarital_sex
# - event: One pregnancy ended in a late miscarriage after days of fever and bleeding;
#     older women treated her with hot compresses, herbal decoctions, and ritual vows
#     at the village goddess shrine.
#   reasoning: Repeated pregnancies in a high-mortality setting make miscarriage/stillbirth/serious
#     complication common; her two infants dying at age 0 also correlates with difficult
#     births or neonatal fragility.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: around age 25

Bhagavati was born on the first day of March in 924, in a village on the dry deciduous plateau east of the main Deccan roads. The local order ran through landed families and their ties to a warrior elite under the Rashtrakutas and their feudatories. In her village the language was the local Deccan Indo‑Aryan speech that later generations called Marathi. People marked seasons by the monsoon and by the goddess shrine at the edge of the fields.

She entered an extended household where an older man’s word set the rhythm. Her grandfather, Dhanapala, sat on a low wooden stool near the doorway when visitors came, and he kept the seals and strings for grain measures. Her father, Khandoba, rode out with other retainers when a local chief demanded men. He kept spear and shield hung from a peg inside the front room, away from the cooking smoke. When he returned he brought news of levies and quarrels between lords, and he brought small things: a strip of iron for a sickle, salt wrapped in a leaf.

Bhagavati was the sixth child. Three brothers came before her, then two sisters. A seventh child followed. The household filled the courtyard with noise: grinding stones in the morning, goats bleating, children chasing each other between the water pots. Her mother, Sona, ran the work without shouting much. She woke before first light, rinsed her mouth at the well, and lit a lamp at the small home shrine. She offered water and a pinch of grain, then set rice or millet to boil. Bhagavati learned to knead dough with her palms, to keep ash from the hearth ready for scrubbing pots, to carry a brass vessel steady on her head.

One of the brothers died as a newborn. The women wrapped the small body in cloth and left it where the men said. The household kept working the same day. Another of her brothers survived and grew into a hard young man who handled cattle and argued with others at the boundary stones. Her sisters helped with carding cotton and fetching water. When they rested, they sat under the neem and chewed roasted chickpeas. Bhagavati liked the sound of bangles when the older girls clapped along to a work song. She repeated the refrains even when she did not understand all the words.

When she was a child the rains failed once. The first showers came thin, then stopped. The millet heads stayed small. Khandoba and Dhanapala met with other village men and talked about what to sell and what to hold. In the women’s corner, Sona stretched the grain by adding more greens and thin gruel. Bhagavati carried water farther each week as the closer pools dried. She watched her mother press turmeric into a cloth and tie it at the doorway, then smear cow dung at the threshold, neat and even, as if the pattern could keep sickness and hunger from stepping in.

By the time Bhagavati reached marriageable age, Khandoba’s standing mattered. He held land and had obligations upward, and he wanted a match that kept alliances close. The marriage was arranged within the village so the land and the ties stayed tight. Her husband’s name was Virana. He came from a household that had cattle and a share in the village council, but his temper ran ahead of his judgment. The wedding brought ritual and noise: women drew designs with rice flour, elders offered blessings, and the village goddess shrine received a vow and a coconut.

In Virana’s house Bhagavati rose before the others and swept the packed earth floor until it showed no footprints. She kept water pots filled and made sure the cattle were led out at the right time. When Virana returned from meetings with other men, she served him first. She kept her voice even. She avoided quarrels in daylight, because neighbors listened.

Virana wanted the prestige of a son who lived. After the first pregnancy she labored long, and the child came out limp and quiet. The women tried oil and warm water, but the baby did not take breath. They gave the child a quick rite and moved on to the next tasks. Virana’s face tightened when he heard the result. He blamed her body. He blamed her family’s dowry. He began to strike her when angry, first with his hand, then with a stick kept by the doorway. Once he kicked her hard enough that she fell against the grain jar and cracked its rim. She cleaned the spilled millet with shaking hands and kept the house silent.

A second child came, a girl, and she lived. Bhagavati named her Sita. Sita’s hair grew thick; she cried loudly when hungry and laughed when tickled under the chin. Bhagavati’s mother visited and brought cloth, and for a few hours the house felt steady. Virana watched the child, then turned away, speaking of sons again. The beatings returned when food ran short or when he had been drinking with men after a dispute. Bhagavati stopped pleading. She kept her eyes steady when he raged. When he raised the stick, she covered her head with her arm and waited for the blows to end.

The third live birth was a boy. He died the same day, small and blue. Virana shouted until his voice cracked. That night he struck her in front of his mother. When the older woman did not stop him, Bhagavati took Sita at dawn, wrapped her in a cloth, and walked back to her father’s compound without waiting for permission. She crossed the fields with her daughter on her hip, dust sticking to her feet. Khandoba listened when she spoke. Dhanapala said nothing for a long moment, then told her to stay.

Returning did not restore her old place. She slept near the women’s storage pots. Her brothers’ wives watched her carefully. Still, her mother gave her a corner of the hearth and a share of work. Bhagavati carried water, ground grain, and took Sita with her to keep the child from wandering into the cattle pen. When a local notable family needed extra hands, Sona sent Bhagavati to serve there. It was safer than begging and less shame than being idle in her brothers’ yard.

At the patron’s compound, Bhagavati washed vessels, swept rooms, and carried bundles of fodder. The house had more space, thicker walls, and a storeroom with sealed jars. The men there talked of levies and of a chief’s demand for cattle. Khandoba himself rode out more than once with other retainers, and each time the village felt tighter, watched.

A male relative of the householder began to corner Bhagavati when she worked away from others. He spoke softly and smiled without warmth. He told her he could have her turned out. He told her servants were blamed when stores went missing. One day he pulled her into a back room where sacks of grain leaned against the wall. He held her wrist and used the threat of accusation and expulsion until she stopped resisting. After that, he came again when he chose. Bhagavati kept her face blank in the courtyard and did not tell the other women.

Later a different man in the compound, a clerk’s cousin named Narayana, spoke to her like a person rather than a tool. He offered a handful of roasted gram for Sita. He slipped extra oil into her pot when he could. Their arrangement became clear without words: she met him in a shed at the edge of the compound, and in exchange he made sure she received grain and that no one pushed her out. Bhagavati kept the meetings hidden. She returned to her father’s house at night and said she had been kept late by work.

When Sita grew, she followed Bhagavati everywhere, asking questions and tugging at her sari. Bhagavati answered briefly and made the child repeat chores until they stuck. She also laughed with Sona at small things: a neighbor’s goat escaping into a courtyard, a toddler smearing soot on his own face. On festival days they went to the village goddess shrine with turmeric and neem leaves. Bhagavati liked the moment after offerings when drums began and the crowd pressed close, when she could stand still and let the noise cover her thoughts.

In her mid‑twenties she suffered a late miscarriage after days of fever and bleeding. Older women in the household pressed hot cloths to her belly, gave her bitter decoctions, and made her promise offerings at the shrine if she lived. She lay on a mat and listened to the grinding stones outside. When she could stand, she returned to work. Her strength stayed uneven for months.

Grain grew dear again after another poor season. The patron’s storeroom stayed fuller than most. Bhagavati began to take small measures of millet while she ground flour, and once she scooped a bit of clarified butter with her fingers and hid it in a folded cloth. She brought it home for Sita. She kept her movements calm and her eyes down. No one spoke to her about it.

In late 952, after the monsoon waters turned the paths slick and the wells tasted of mud, dysentery swept through the village. Bhagavati began passing watery stool and could not keep food down. Sona boiled water and added salt when she had it. Bhagavati’s mouth dried and her skin cooled. She died on September 21, 952, on a mat inside her father’s house, with Sita asleep against Sona’s hip and the courtyard quiet except for flies and the sound of a goat chewing.
