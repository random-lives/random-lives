#     butter from the storehouse over several visits to feed herself and her surviving
#     daughter.
#   reasoning: Economic pressure after separation could lead to small-scale theft or
#     illicit taking (grain, cloth), but her natal-kin support and high honesty-humility
#     reduce the likelihood of deliberate property crime.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: around ages 24–26
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime
# - event: While working as an attendant in a higher-status household, a male relative
#     of the householder coerced her into sex in a back room by threatening to have
#     her turned out and accusing her of theft.
#   reasoning: Given marital separation, variable dependence on kin/patrons, and endemic
#     coercion with limited recourse, the chance that her experienced violence included
#     sexual coercion/assault is fairly high.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: around ages 22–23
#   type: sexual_violence
# - event: During her marriage, her husband beat her with a stick and kicked her after
#     disputes over dowry and her failure to produce a surviving son, and she eventually
#     fled back to her father’s house.
#   reasoning: In this setting, violence by a husband or other household authority figure
#     was common and is a plausible contributor to separation/return to natal kin.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: around ages 18–21
#   type: domestic_violence
# - event: After separation, she entered a secret ongoing liaison with a man connected
#     to the patron’s household, exchanging sex for regular grain and protection while
#     she lacked a stable marital home.
#   reasoning: After abandonment/separation, any subsequent sexual relationship (consensual
#     or coerced but repeated) would be categorized as outside marriage, making this
#     a leading pathway to 'nonstandard' history.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: around ages 22–24
#   type: extramarital_sex
# - event: One pregnancy ended in a late miscarriage after days of fever and bleeding;
#     older women treated her with hot compresses, herbal decoctions, and ritual vows
#     at the village goddess shrine.
#   reasoning: Repeated pregnancies in a high-mortality setting make miscarriage/stillbirth/serious
#     complication common; her two infants dying at age 0 also correlates with difficult
#     births or neonatal fragility.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: around age 25

Bhagavati was born on March 1, 924, in a small settlement on the dry plateau east of the big Deccan routes, where fields depended on the monsoon and the village shrine stood closer than any stone temple. The area lay under the reach of Rashtrakuta power and its feudatories. For her family that meant officers arriving for grain and cattle counts, and the village headmen settling demands with measured baskets and promises. Her people spoke the local Deccan Indo‑Aryan tongue at home and in the lanes, and they marked days with household offerings and the goddess’s festival.

She entered an extended household under an old woman’s authority. Her paternal grandmother, Ajji, ran the inner rooms. Ajji kept neem leaves hanging near the grain pots and tied black threads on children’s wrists after a cough went through the houses. Soma, Bhagavati’s mother, woke before sunrise, rinsed the courtyard, and lit a small lamp at the household corner shrine. Bhagavati watched, handed her water, and learned to keep quiet during the first prayers.

Bhagavati was the sixth child. Ganga, the eldest sister, carried infants on her hip and slapped boys’ hands away from the drying millet cakes. Vira and Mahadeva, the older brothers, followed their father Rudradeva to the edge of fields to hear men argue about boundaries and grazing. A third brother had died in 915, long before Bhagavati could remember him, yet his absence stayed present in Ajji’s rules. Soma kept vows at the village goddess’s shrine and talked about what happens when the goddess is not paid what she is owed.

Chandra, the youngest sister, arrived in 927. Bhagavati liked the baby’s smell of oil and smoke and the soft head before hair thickened. She also liked the work that took her out of the women’s rooms: carrying a brass lota to the well, wiping spilled grain off the threshold, and walking with Lila, her older sister born in 921, to collect fallen branches from the scrub and small forest patches. She preferred the early morning for this, before men filled the lanes and before heat pressed down. She teased Lila about her careful braids, and Lila answered by flicking water at Bhagavati’s ankles.

In 938, when Bhagavati was fourteen, Ganga died at twenty‑eight. The death came after a short illness that left Ganga too tired to stand at the grinding stone. Ajji took charge of the funerary rites and Soma did the practical work: water, firewood, food for relatives who arrived and then stayed. After Ganga’s death, Soma shifted tasks to the younger girls. Bhagavati rose earlier, carried heavier loads, and learned to keep count of grain measures by the feel of the basket in her hands.

That same year, Rudradeva’s militia obligations sharpened. Rivals pressed in from different directions and local chiefs demanded men, grain, and cattle. Rudradeva spent more time away, sometimes sleeping in other villages with other retainers. When he returned, he brought news, a new bruise, and a wary look when strangers entered the courtyard. He counted the family’s animals with Mahadeva and spoke to Ajji in a low voice. The women listened while they worked.

Bhagavati married in 938. Her husband, Keshava, lived close enough that she still heard familiar accents in the lane, but she moved into his household under his mother’s eye. The wedding brought exchanges of cloth and pots and the public tying of obligations between households. Within weeks she learned the rules of another kitchen: where the firewood stacks belonged, how much water to draw, which storage jar was for ghee and which for oil. She kept the floor swept hard and neat. She liked setting out lentils to dry and picking through them for stones, one quick handful at a time.

In 940 she gave birth to a daughter who died the same day. The women washed the infant and wrapped her in cloth. Keshava’s mother muttered about bad luck. Keshava said little in front of others and then, in private, blamed Bhagavati for weakness. The next year brought tight rains and poor yields in some fields, and prices rose in the weekly market. Keshava grew sharper, angry about the household’s obligations and the dowry he said had been too small for what he took on.

In 942 Bhagavati bore another daughter, Vimala. The child lived and fed well. Bhagavati carried her high on her hip and learned to hush her with a small rhythm of rocking while keeping her hands free for work. She spoke to Vimala in short phrases, naming objects and tasks, as if teaching the child the household’s order.

In 943 she gave birth to a son who died at birth. The death brought the household into open conflict. Keshava’s mother demanded vows and offerings, and Keshava demanded money and grain from Bhagavati’s natal household. Bhagavati’s brothers refused. Keshava turned his anger on Bhagavati. In 943 he beat her with a stick after a dispute over grain stored for Vimala’s weaning. In 944 he kicked her hard during another quarrel, shouting that she shamed him by failing to keep a son alive. After that beating, Bhagavati took Vimala and left before dawn, walking back to her father’s courtyard with her hair tied tight and her face set.

Rudradeva accepted her without ceremony. Ajji scolded her for returning with trouble attached, then told Soma to make space. Vira stood between her and the men who came from Keshava’s side to demand her return. Bhagavati stayed. She worked as she had before marriage, except now she carried a child and took orders from brothers as well as elders. At times she was treated as protected kin; at times she was treated as an extra mouth. She reacted fast to being pushed, speaking back in plain words, and then settling into silence when she chose.

In 946 Vira died at thirty‑four after an illness that left him thin and coughing. His death reduced Bhagavati’s protection. Mahadeva, now the strongest voice in the household, decided she would earn by serving in a higher-status compound tied to local authority. In 946 she began attending there: sweeping courtyards, carrying water, washing brass, and watching children. She learned who liked their buttermilk thin and who wanted it thick. She avoided the house’s older men by keeping to the women’s spaces and moving briskly with her eyes down.

In 946, a male relative of the householder cornered her in a back room. He accused her of taking cloth and threatened to have her turned out. He forced sex on her there, with no witness and no recourse. Afterward she returned to work, kept her mouth closed, and learned which doorway to avoid.

In 947 she entered a secret liaison with Govinda, a man attached to the patron household’s network. He brought small bundles of grain and sometimes a little salt. He promised protection from accusations and from being cast out. She met him at times when others slept, and she kept the arrangement hidden from her mother and sisters. The liaison lasted through 948, and it bought her food and a narrow margin of safety.

In 949 the rains failed early and the harvest came short. Grain prices rose again. In 949 and 950, when she was sent to grind grain at the patron’s compound, Bhagavati took small measures of millet and a bit of ghee from the store jars on several visits. She hid the millet in the folds of her cloth and carried the ghee in a small wrapped leaf bundle. She fed Vimala first, then ate what remained.

In 949, at age twenty‑five, she became pregnant again. That year she fell ill with fever and then began bleeding. The women of the household treated her with hot compresses, decoctions, and strict rest. Soma and Lila took her to the village goddess’s shrine and made vows with turmeric and flowers. The pregnancy ended in a late miscarriage. Bhagavati returned to work when she could stand without swaying, and she said little about it.

In 952, during the late monsoon season, she developed severe diarrhea. Water came from shared sources and the lanes stank of waste where animals and children moved together. She remained in her natal household courtyard, too weak to work. On September 21, 952, Bhagavati died at twenty‑eight.
