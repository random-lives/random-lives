Nikandros was born in late spring of 50 AD in a small farming settlement above the Hermos valley, in the Roman province of Asia. The emperor’s officials ruled through nearby cities and their councils, but his family lived under a patron’s reach and local custom. At home they spoke Greek and kept a small shrine by the hearth, with a clay lamp, a bowl for barley, and a cup for wine.

His father, Diodoros, had been enslaved when young and later freed. He rented plots from a landowner connected to his former master’s circle. He cut vines, broke clods for grain, and kept accounts on a wax tablet when dues came due. Nikandros’s mother, Thaleia, worked beside him. She led a donkey with panniers, carried bundles of brush for the oven, and took a sickle into the fields at harvest. Between tasks she nursed the baby and kept him wrapped close against dust and flies.

Five children had been born before him. Two were buried as infants. The eldest, Philainis, was already tall enough to carry water; another son, Menandros, helped set snares; the youngest daughter, Damaris, slept near the hearth.

When winter rains ended and cold nights lingered, Nikandros began coughing. His chest rattled. Thaleia warmed water and held him upright. Diodoros went to a neighbor for a poultice and promised a small offering at the village shrine. The cough thickened. On March 5, 51 AD, Nikandros died in the house.
