Keshab was born on a June morning in 1255, with the Brahmaputra high and brown and the air heavy over the semi-evergreen trees beyond the cleared plots. His village sat on low ground west of the river’s main flow. Houses stood on raised earth, their yards edged with areca and bamboo. Rice fields lay in flat blocks broken by ponds, narrow streams, and wet hollows that filled when the river climbed.

He came into a stem household. His father, Hari, worked a small holding of rainfed rice and owed grain and labor when the agents of the local lord came through. His mother, Padumi, kept the hearth going, hauled water, managed seed and stores, and stepped into the fields when hands were short. An older man lived under the same roof beams, coughing in the mornings and watching how work was done.

Keshab was the third child. Two elder sisters died young. Their names were spoken softly once in a while and then left alone. One sister lived to adulthood and learned the routines early: pounding rice, drying grain, keeping the jars shut against damp and rats.

In their Kamrupi speech the men still called the country Kamarupa, though they also used the newer name people said at markets and on the roads. The name did not change the river or the flood or the work. It changed who collected and how hard they pressed.

Keshab never learned letters. No one in his household read, and no one sent him to sit with a teacher. He spent his boyhood moving toward noise and company. He lingered at the pond steps where women scrubbed pots and traded news. He hovered at the weekly market, helping carry loads for a pinch of salt or a scrap of dried fish. When disputes rose, he stayed under the peepal’s shade to listen, quick to laugh at a sharp remark and quicker to add his own.

He liked being noticed. If another boy cut in front of him at the water’s edge, Keshab argued until an older man told both to stop. If he won, he made sure it was seen.

By his teens he spent more time on the floodplain than in the rice. He went to the beels and backwaters with men who set traps and cast nets. In the planting weeks he worked the mud like everyone else. After that, when the paddies only needed weeding and watch, he returned to the water. The river gave fish when grain ran low, and it gave it on days when the field gave nothing.

He started with a borrowed cast net and a small dugout that two households shared. He learned what a wet net did to the arm and how a current could swing a light boat. He learned to read the surface for the pull of a deeper channel. By the time he married, people spoke of him as a fisherman first and a cultivator after.

His wife, Malati, came from a nearby settlement. Her family brought cloth and a few brass vessels, and neighbors came with labor and cooked rice for the day. Malati entered the courtyard quietly and watched how Padumi stored grain and how Hari spoke when he was displeased. Keshab talked more after she arrived. He brought her into the day’s decisions as if it pleased him to have another adult listening.

They kept a small puja place inside the house. Malati swept it, set out water, and lit a lamp when oil allowed. Keshab offered when he remembered and when the river scared him. Before the monsoon rose he touched his forehead to the threshold and asked for the roof to hold and the boat to come back upright. He spoke in his own plain words.

In his twenties the demands tightened. Men from the local authority came in the season after harvest, with a retinue and a clerk who could name households and remember who had paid and who had not. They counted rice and took fish as well, and they pressed men for days of work—cutting earth, carrying loads, clearing a track along higher ground where messengers moved.

Keshab made a public show of his anger. When the agents stood at the village edge he spoke too loudly about how much a man could give and still keep children fed. He followed them a few steps, arguing, and the boys listened. In the end he carried earth with the others and gave what was demanded, but he turned it into talk that lasted the whole evening.

A bad monsoon year cut the household’s stores. Early rains battered the seedlings, then a long stretch of dull heat left the plants thin. The harvest came in light. The jars emptied sooner. Keshab answered by staying longer on the water. He slept out some nights, a boat pulled up on a sandbar, men lying close to keep off the damp. He came home with fish, crabs, and bundles of greens, and Malati cooked what he brought and measured it out without comment.

When the grain ran shortest, Malati took small loans from a better-off house, repaying in labor and later in rice. Keshab hated having to ask, and he hated the way it made him feel small in other men’s eyes. He began pushing harder at the market, bargaining for salt and iron fishhooks and new line. He talked as if he could promise more than he had in hand.

Once he came back with new line and would not say clearly what he had traded for it. Malati asked him in the courtyard while his mother listened from the doorway. Keshab answered too fast and too bright. Malati let it drop. The quiet made him restless for the rest of the day.

In his thirties he lost his net in the monsoon. A squall came up fast, wind flattening the reeds and roughening the open water. He and a younger man tried to turn their dugout, but the trailing net snagged and pulled. The boat rolled hard. They kept it from going over, but the net tore and sank. They dove until their hands cramped, feeling along the bottom in muddy darkness. They came up coughing and empty.

Replacing the net meant borrowing. The lender held grain in bulk and spoke easily with the collector’s men. Keshab sat in that courtyard with his grin fixed in place and agreed to give fish shares after the rains. The debt sat on him. He took longer trips and chose quicker water when the catch was good, as if speed could shorten what he owed.

By 1298 his household stayed ordinary. His mother still lived under the same roof, older and sharp-eyed. One son, grown and strong, worked beside him at the water’s edge. A daughter in her teens carried water and helped Malati with the grain and the fire.

On September 28, after the main rains had eased, the river still ran hard. Keshab took the dugout out in the morning with a bundle of line and a small basket. He aimed for a channel that had been running clear and fast, where fish moved along the edge of the current.

Near midday he stood to reach forward and shift a line. The boat rocked on a hidden swirl. The dugout tipped, and he went in on his side. A loop of line caught his arm. He tried to wrench free, kicking against the pull, but the current held him down. The boat drifted into the reeds. When people found it later, Keshab was not with it.
