Keshab was born on June 10, 1255, in the western Brahmaputra valley, where cleared plots ended quickly in wet forest and reed beds. The air stayed warm, and rain-fed rice grew in the low fields, but the river shifted each season. A bank that held one year could break the next, and a strip of good land could slide away in a night of hard rain.

His family lived in a compound of bamboo walls and thatch. They were ordinary peasants with a few small plots and the usual burdens: grain dues and labor when local men demanded it. His father, Hari, worked the paddies and argued over boundaries with neighbors when the water moved the marks. His mother, Padumi, ran the inside work and a share of the outside: cooking, fuel and water, pounding grain, drying seed, and bending over seedlings when hands were short. Keshab was born into a stem household. His father’s father still lived in the courtyard, thin and sharp-voiced, treating the place as his.

He had three sisters, all older. Two died in infancy. The third lived long and kept her place in the compound even after marriage ties pulled other women away. She remembered the days of wailing and the quick return to work. Keshab did not remember the dead girls. He remembered the living noises: pestles striking mortars, goats, quarrels, laughter, and his grandfather calling for water.

He spoke the Kamrupi vernacular of the area. He could not read or write, and no one spent time trying to change that. A few men in nearby settlements kept marks for dues and could recite learned verses, but Keshab was not sent to sit with them. He could not hold still. When his father showed him how to measure seed, Keshab rushed it. When he was told to mend a rope cleanly, he tied knots that slipped. When he was corrected, he laughed and looked away.

He helped in the paddies when the crop demanded it—transplanting, weeding, harvesting—but he spent as much time as he could at water. Ponds, backwaters, and side channels gave fish and crabs, reeds for thatch, and places to talk out of earshot of older men. He liked groups. He liked being the one who suggested a trip, the one who carried news, the one who made others laugh. He also took what he could. He borrowed a tool and returned it late. He promised someone a share of a catch and then kept the best fish aside. When confronted, he talked quickly, smiled, and acted as if the complaint was a joke.

By his late teens he was known for it. People still welcomed him into a boat or a work group because he was good company and not afraid of the river, but they watched their baskets and counted their shares. His mother scolded him inside the house. His father scolded him where others could hear, and Keshab hated that more than any fine.

As he grew into a man, the household’s farming stayed, but Keshab’s own work shifted. Rice kept the family fed in good years, yet cash and barter came easier from fish. He began to spend most days on the water, setting lines and nets and walking wet loads to the weekly market. He learned which stalls would take fish first, who cheated on weight, who paid in salt or iron, and who would advance goods against future catches.

In his early twenties he married. Malati came from a nearby settlement and moved into his family’s compound. She learned quickly where the seed jars were kept, how the household stored curd, and which corner of the house held the small shrine. Their religious practice stayed close to home: water at the shrine each morning, a lamp on observance days, village festivals in season, and visits to a local shrine on festival trips. Keshab paid attention when danger felt near. Before the heavy rains he made offerings and then took the boat out as if the river owed him care in return.

They had four children. A son lived to adulthood. Three daughters were born; two died young, and one lived into her teens. Malati carried the grief as part of her days. Keshab did not. When a child died he left the house and went to the water, coming back with fish and acting as if he had brought a solution. Malati took what he brought and said little. She did not fight with him. She let silence sit between them until he stopped trying to turn it into a joke.

In adulthood, demands from local authority came harder and closer. Collectors arrived more often, and sometimes they came with armed men. A levy could be demanded in rice or in fish. Short bursts of forced labor were called in when a chief wanted an embankment raised or a track cleared along the higher ground. Keshab complained loudly when his turn came, making other men laugh, but he still showed up. He also tried to slip out of it. Once he sent a younger cousin in his place and later insisted it counted as his day. The headman rejected it and recorded the absence. Keshab paid with extra days, and he carried the resentment as if he had been cheated rather than caught.

A bad monsoon year struck in his thirties. The timing went wrong and the water lingered too long. Seedlings weakened, the plants stood pale, and the harvest came in thin. The household borrowed a jar of rice from a better-off neighbor, to be repaid after the next harvest. Keshab hated owing anything, but he hated steady restraint more. He answered the shortage by taking more risks on the river and by taking advances at the market. He promised future fish for salt and cloth, then spent the goods quickly. When Malati asked what he would give back when the season was poor, he brushed her off and said the river always filled a net for a man who worked.

A few years later he lost the best net the household owned. He and a younger man took the dugout into a broad, shallow reach where wind could rise fast. A squall hit and pushed chop across the water. The net snagged on a sudden pull of current and tore. They dragged it in, hand over hand, until it ripped free and sank. They dove for it, groping blind in the mud, and came up choking. The net was gone. The loss landed like a broken granary door. For days Keshab cursed the younger man, then cursed the river, then acted as if anger could bring the net back.

Malati did not argue about blame. She asked him, once, how he would replace it. He snapped at her and accused her of thinking he was useless. That night he tried to smooth it over with fish and talk. The next week he borrowed from a man who dealt with collectors and could squeeze villagers when they fell behind. The terms were simple: a share of catch, repayment in kind, and labor when ordered. Keshab agreed too quickly. He wanted the net replaced, and he believed he could charm his way through whatever came later.

After that, he stayed longer on the water. He set lines in stronger channels, went out in weather other men avoided, and took trips that left Malati to manage the house and the older parent who still lived in the compound. His grown son began to go with him and learned the work as Keshab did it: fast, risky, full of shortcuts, counting on luck to cover what care should have covered.

By forty-three, Keshab’s place in the village had not changed. He was not important, not ruined, not trusted in full. People joked with him and watched him. Malati kept the household steady. Their adolescent daughter carried water and helped pound rice. An older parent remained in the compound, frail and demanding.

On September 28, 1298, after the heaviest rains had passed but the river still ran hard, Keshab took the dugout out alone. He went to a channel that cut along reeds and bit at the bank. He stood to shift his weight and free a line. The wet wood slid under his foot. He fell over the side, and the line looped his arm as he went in. He fought it, kicking and pulling, but the current turned him and held him down. The boat drifted into the reeds. He did not come back up.
