Raghunath was born on June 10, 1255, in a village on the low ground of the western Brahmaputra valley, where rice plots ran into reeds and then into forest again. Even in the cold months the days stayed mild. In the rains, water spread across the yards and left silt and leeches behind when it fell.

His people spoke the local Kamrupi vernacular. It was the language of scolding children, striking bargains, and passing news along the riverbank. Three generations ate from the same hearth. His father’s father still lived in the house and kept a hard hand on the store jars. He decided what grain could be spared, who got the plough ox for a day, which requests would be denied without argument.

Raghunath’s father worked a small holding of rainfed rice. In a good year the household stored enough paddy to bridge the hungry months. In a bad one they stretched gruel and turned more often to fish and forest foods. His mother ran the work that made the house run at all: water and fuel, cooking, pounding rice, drying seed, tending greens near the wall, and stepping into the fields when transplanting needed more hands.

He was the third child and the first son. Three older sisters came before him. Two died as infants. The women washed the bodies, wrapped them, and carried them out. The men spoke of causes and omens and then went back to work. The surviving sister grew into a sharp-tongued woman who remembered every slight and never let him forget his debts.

He never learned to read. No one in his compound could teach him, and no one paid to send an ordinary boy to a teacher. He counted by stones and by habit. When he owed something, he kept it in his head as a weight, not a number. He judged water depth with a pole, read fish movement by a ripple, and knew how long a jar of grain would last if the lid stayed shut. Careful planning defeated him. He began tasks with a rush and left them half-done. He tied knots fast and had to retie them. He misplaced tools and argued over whose they were.

He liked people more than he liked weeding. As a boy he drifted toward groups of men talking under trees and pushed his way in. He repeated jokes until they turned stale. He carried messages between households for the attention and for the chance to hear other people’s business. When boatmen came downriver with salt and iron and scraps of news, he hovered close and listened.

The household kept ordinary Brahmanical practice. Inside the house a small space was kept clean for offerings: water in a cup, a lamp, flowers when they had them, a smear of ash or sandal. On festival days the village gathered at a nearby shrine, drums sounding through the afternoon. Raghunath bowed when others bowed. He made offerings before the rains and before longer trips. He avoided sitting through formal recitations. He stood outside and talked.

As a young man he worked in his father’s fields because he had to, but he shaped his days around the floodplain. Fishing and foraging suited him. The work rewarded quick choices and nerve. It also let him move. He took short trips along the waterways to weekly markets, carrying fish wrapped in wet leaves. He came home with salt, iron hooks, a strip of cloth, sometimes oil, paid for in fish, labor promised later, or a measure of grain.

He built a social net as much as a fishing net. He called in favors easily and acted as if he belonged everywhere. People laughed with him and watched him at the same time.

His dishonesty showed in small, steady ways. He borrowed a basket and returned it cracked, blaming a cousin. He promised part of a catch to a neighbor whose boat he had used, and arrived with less and a long story about snags and crocodiles. He did not enjoy open cruelty, and he could be helpful in the same week. But he pushed until someone stopped yielding. When that happened, he acted wronged. Over time it cost him. Fewer people lent to him. More eyes stayed on his hands at the market.

He married in his early twenties. His wife moved into his compound and into the daily judgment of his mother and his older sister. She did not match his talk. She listened, worked, and saved her anger for moments when it landed cleanly. She learned where seed was kept, which jars belonged to the elders, which neighbors would help at transplanting and which would demand repayment down to a handful of rice. Raghunath admired her competence and resented it because it made his carelessness plain.

They had four children: a son and three daughters. Two daughters died as infants, taken by fever and thin milk. Another daughter lived into her teens. Their son reached adulthood and worked alongside his father. Raghunath carried grief badly. After a child died, he fled to the river and returned with fish as if a full basket could cover the silence in the house. His wife took the food and did not soften her face for him. That refusal stopped him more than scolding ever did.

As he grew older, demands from local authority tightened. The valley’s power sat close by: chiefs, their armed men, and village headmen who had to answer for quotas. Collectors arrived to take grain and fish and to call men for labor. The reason was always the same. Routes had to be kept open. Earthworks had to be raised. Clearings had to be cut. Whatever lay beyond the next bend of forest and river was named as a threat.

Raghunath hated corvée work and made a show of it. He complained loudly in the yard and at the market, turning it into a performance. Then he tried to dodge his turn. Once he sent a younger cousin to stand in for him on embankment work, insisting it was the same as going himself. The headman did not accept it. Raghunath served extra days under watch, and his resentment spilled out as jokes that cut too close. People laughed and then looked away.

In his thirties a monsoon year failed the rice. The rains came wrong and then came hard. Seedlings rotted. The harvest shrank. The household leaned harder on fish and forest foods. Raghunath went out more often, traveling to market whenever he had something to carry. His wife went to a better-off household and took paddy on credit, agreeing to repay after the next harvest. Raghunath hated owing. He responded by pretending the debt did not matter. He promised big catches. He talked instead of mending gear.

The gear loss came in the rains. He and a younger man took a dugout into a wide stretch of water. Wind rose fast and pushed chop against the boat. Raghunath stood to shift the net, showing off how easily he could handle it. A sudden current caught the line. The net tore and slid under. They reached, cursed, and dove, groping blind in muddy water, but it was gone. The loss hit at once: less food, less trade, and shame that did not wash off.

To replace the net he borrowed from a man who dealt easily with the collectors. The terms were hard: repayment in fish and days of labor at the lender’s call. Raghunath agreed with a wide smile and too much confidence. After that he took more risks on the water to meet what he owed. He stayed out later. He pushed into faster channels. He began taking his grown son with him, using him as extra hands and as a witness when disputes came.

On September 28, 1298, the rains had eased, but the river still ran strong and full. Raghunath took the boat out alone to set lines in a channel where fish moved after the monsoon. He stood to shift his footing and pull a snagged line free. The dugout rocked in a hidden swirl. His foot slid on wet wood and he fell over the side with the line looped around his forearm.

He came up once and tried to tear the loop loose. The current turned him. The line tightened. He kicked and reached for the boat, but the water pulled him under again and held him there. The dugout drifted toward the reeds without him and bumped softly as it caught.
