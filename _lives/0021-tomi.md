#     name: Teka
#     narrative_role: Generalist hunter/provider; strict about meat-sharing rules and
#       reputation. Relationship with Tomi is tense but not abusive—praise is rare,
#       criticism frequent, which fuels Tomi's anxiety and resentment.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: -2320
#     name: Pala
#     narrative_role: Primary early-life anchor; exhausted from repeated pregnancies
#       and infant losses, she relies on older daughters for help. Relationship is warm
#       but strained by scarcity; she worries over Tomi's temper and teaches him caution
#       and taboo observance.
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: -2348
#     name: Pem
#     narrative_role: Present in Tomi's early years in the broader kin camp; provides
#       stories, small rituals for infant deaths, and occasional protection when household
#       standing is low.
#     role: maternal grandmother (camp elder)

#     death_age: 64
#     death_year: -2272
#     name: Naki
#     narrative_role: Only child; grows into a capable gatherer and organizer of food
#       processing. Relationship with Tomi is affectionate but guarded—she learned early
#       to anticipate his moods; as an adult she keeps some distance after marrying
#       into another hearth cluster.
#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 22
#     connection: Escalates from Tomi’s low agreeableness and anxiety about being shorted;
#       after one beating and split scalp, older brother Kano pressures him to make
#       public amends and share extra meat to avoid retaliation/expulsion.
#     incident: physical_assault
#   - age: 46
#     connection: Happens during a difficult hunting season when he pushes himself to
#       prove usefulness; the forced dependency intensifies his fear of being a burden
#       and contributes to his later social marginality.
#     incident: serious_accident
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6
#     key_events:
#     - Born into a low-prestige household marked by earlier infant deaths; mother focuses
#       on childcare while older sisters gather and carry.
#     - Learns early camp rules about meat-sharing and taboo places through grandmother
#       Pem and sister Saka; develops anxious vigilance around sickness and scarcity.
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 7-18
#     key_events:
#     - Begins following father and older brother Kano on short hunts and tracking lessons;
#       struggles with comparisons to Kano and reacts defensively.
#     - First reputation for sharp words and quick temper; occasional scuffles with
#       other boys, followed by forced reconciliations mediated by sisters.
#     - By late teens he is a competent but not admired hunter; his extraversion shows
#       in talk and bragging that sometimes backfires.
#     phase: Later childhood & adolescence
#   - age_range: 19-30
#     key_events:
#     - Becomes a full hunting adult; recurring disputes about distribution of meat
#       and accusations of taking prime portions.
#     - Relationship begins with Monite (kin-brokered pairing) to steady him socially;
#       first years include conflict, then routines form.
#     - Birth of daughter Naki (around age 29) provides a new stake in camp cooperation
#       and modestly improves his standing.
#     phase: Young adulthood
#   - age_range: 31-55
#     key_events:
#     - Sister Suli dies (Tomi ~23) earlier than this phase but her absence continues
#       to affect him; by his 30s he is more controlled, more reliable in sharing.
#     - Serious accident in his mid-40s forces weeks of dependency; he experiences shame
#       and heightened anxiety, then shifts toward safer hunting tactics and mentoring
#       younger men.
#     - Father Teka dies when Tomi is early 30s, removing a critical voice; Tomi’s rivalry
#       with Kano softens into practical cooperation.
#     phase: Midlife
#   - age_range: 56-72
#     key_events:
#     - Mother Pala dies when Tomi is mid-40s; wife Monite dies when Tomi is late 60s,
#       shrinking his close household ties.
#     - 'Increasingly peripheral in camp: still contributes (repairing gear, advising
#       routes) but sleeps on the edge and is less included in food pooling.'
#     - 'Final months: weakened by bouts of stomach illness; dies of severe gastrointestinal
#       infection/dehydration while seasonally mobile.'
#     phase: Old age
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Kinori
#     prominence: Ages 19-27 (peaks during the assault incidents); occasional later
#       appearances
#     relationship: Rival hunter from a neighboring hearth cluster; frequent opponent
#       in disputes over meat and accusations
#   - name: Pulaka
#     prominence: After the age-22 beating and especially during recovery from the age-46
#       accident

#       taboos after injury
#   - name: Kumai
#     prominence: Ages 24-40
#     relationship: Monite’s brother; skeptical of Tomi and watches him closely early
#       on, later becomes a grudging cooperative partner in hunts
#   - name: Tepalo
#     prominence: Ages 50-72
#     relationship: Younger hunter mentored by Tomi after his accident; occasionally
#       brings him food in old age but not consistently
#   partners:
#   - name: Monite
#     narrative_role: Primary partner/wife; the match is arranged/encouraged by kin
#       to stabilize Tomi. Relationship is practical and sometimes stormy—arguments
#       over jealousy and sharing—but they develop routine cooperation; she dies years
#       before Tomi, leaving him socially looser at the margins.

#     death_age: 72
#     death_year: -2292
#     name: Tomi

#       over time.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: -2363
#     death_age: 73
#     death_year: -2290
#     name: Kun
#     narrative_role: Younger brother by ~2 years; more easygoing and socially smoother.
#       As adults, Kun often serves as Tomi's bridge back into camp cooperation, though
#       he also resents having to smooth over Tomi's conflicts.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Creates irritability and mistrust, feeding disputes; also makes him
#       vigilant in tracking weather and animal signs, which occasionally helps hunts.
#     scene: He repeatedly checks snares and re-counts dried meat portions, insisting
#       someone will steal from them or that sickness is coming; he sleeps lightly and
#       startles at night sounds.
#     timing: Childhood through midlife (most visible ages 10-35; resurges after age
#       46 accident)
#     trait: High Neuroticism (73rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Leads directly to the recurring assault pattern and a reputation
#       for being 'hard to sit with,' contributing to later peripheral living.
#     scene: During meat division he argues loudly, calls others liars, and refuses
#       to back down, turning minor grievances into public confrontations.
#     timing: Young adulthood (ages 19-27 peak); moderates somewhat after marriage/child
#     trait: Low Agreeableness (18th percentile)
#   - consequence: Gains visibility and occasional allies, but also draws attention
#       to his mistakes and inflames conflicts.
#     scene: He talks big after a successful hunt, tells stories around the fire, and
#       inserts himself into group discussions—even when elders want quiet.
#     timing: Adolescence and young adulthood (ages 15-30)
#     trait: Higher Extraversion (63rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Helps him recover from earlier low-prestige reputation and reach
#       moderate standing, even if he remains abrasive.
#     scene: When confronted about a missing tool or disputed meat portion, he tends
#       to admit what he did and offers compensation rather than deny endlessly.
#     timing: More evident after settling into adulthood (ages 28-55)
#     trait: High Honesty-Humility (67th percentile)
#   - consequence: Limits rise to high prestige and makes him more dependent on established
#       methods; contributes to anxiety when novel situations arise.
#     scene: He is slower to learn complex knapping sequences and misreads some social
#       nuances in negotiations; he relies on routine and imitation rather than innovation.
#     timing: Adolescence onward
#     trait: Lower Intelligence (27th percentile)
#   - consequence: Delays/complicates pairing; increases insecurity within marriage
#       and fuels some early disputes with other men.
#     scene: Peers and potential partners treat him as a last-choice match; jokes about
#       his looks sting and he overcompensates with bravado and possessiveness.
#     timing: Adolescence through early marriage years
#     trait: Very low physical attractiveness (3rd percentile)
# number_of_children: '1'
# number_of_siblings: '7'
# occupation: 'Hunter (generalist: large/small game; tracking, butchery, weapon use)
#   as primary role'

# structured_incidents:
# - event: 'Recurring pattern: as a young adult hunter he was drawn into several serious
#     fist-and-club fights during camp disputes over meat-sharing and accusations of
#     taking the best cuts; in one confrontation he was beaten and left with heavy bruising
#     and a split scalp but recovered.'
#   reasoning: Fights with other men (disputes over food, accusations, status, retaliation)
#     were a common form of violence exposure for adult males, especially for a conflict-prone
#     personality and later social marginality.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Ages 19–27
#   type: physical_assault
# - event: 'Single event: while tracking deer on a steep pine-oak slope, he slipped
#     on loose rock and tumbled down a short ravine, likely fracturing a rib and badly
#     spraining his ankle/foot; he was unable to travel or hunt normally for weeks and
#     had to be brought food and water by campmates.'
#   reasoning: A lifetime generalist hunter is frequently exposed to falls, cuts, fractures,
#     animal injuries, and burns; surviving to 72 makes at least one weeks-long incapacitating
#     injury quite plausible.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Around age 46 (mid-40s)

Tomi was born into a small band of foragers moving through the pine-oak ridges and dry gullies above the Balsas drainage. No chiefs or towns directed their movements. Decisions came from elders and from who could feed others, and the dead were kept close through food placed in rock shelters and by camp fires.

His mother, Pala, kept him tight to her body in his first years. She was tired from births spaced across two decades. Three siblings had lived to grow: Saka, the oldest sister, nearly twenty years older than Tomi; Kano, the older brother who already hunted with their father; and Suli, eight years older and quick with teasing. Two years after Tomi came Kun, the youngest, who cried less and smiled more. Before Tomi, three baby girls had died—Noh on the day she was born, then Amo before she could walk steadily, then Mepa soon after birth. Those losses sat in the household like a stain other families noticed. When Pem, Pala's mother, prepared a small token for one of the infant deaths, she used a pinch of red earth and a few seeds wrapped in fiber and left it in a crevice near a boulder above a spring. Tomi watched her do it and asked questions until she snapped at him to be quiet and keep his hands off.

Saka carried him when Pala's arms were full. Suli teased him with names for his face and his awkward limbs. When he ran crying to Saka, she wiped his cheeks with a wet hand and told him to stop giving Suli what she wanted. Tomi learned early to look hard at people's hands when food was divided. He counted pieces. He complained. He did it as a child, loud enough that other adults heard and corrected him in front of everyone.

His father, Teka, returned from hunts with blood on his hands and a tight jaw. He expected sons to watch and to learn without asking. Tomi followed anyway. Kano learned quickly: how to read tracks in dust, where deer crossed a saddle, how to wait without shifting. Tomi copied what he saw, but the sequence of steps never settled into his body as easily. When he made mistakes, Teka's correction came fast. Kano's was quieter, a tug at the elbow and a short instruction. Tomi hated needing it.

Their camp moved with seasons. In the dry months they stayed closer to dependable water, gathering seeds and small fruits and taking rabbits and birds. When rains came, they climbed higher for cooler nights and fresh greens. Tomi liked early morning, the first noise of people waking and the smell of ash and last night’s smoke. He liked roasted agave hearts when someone found a good plant and tended the pit well. He ate quickly, then checked the edge of camp for tracks, as if some person would come and take what the household had.

When he was twelve, Pem died. The old woman’s body was wrapped in a woven mat and carried to a rock shelter they used in storms. An elder placed a few kernels and a scrap of dried meat near her hands, and the adults rubbed ash on their foreheads before returning to camp. Tomi repeated the ash rubbing later, alone, until Suli slapped his wrist and told him to stop wasting it.

As he grew into a teenager he talked too much around the fires. He told hunting stories as if he had been the one to make Kano’s kills. People laughed at him, then laughed harder when he doubled down. It made him restless. He started scuffling with other boys and came back with split lips and scraped knuckles. Pala cleaned him with warm water, muttering about how he would bring trouble down on all of them.

At nineteen he began hunting as a full adult. He carried a spear and a club, and he took his turn on long walks, circling ridges and dropping into ravines, searching for deer and peccary. He did not bring back as much as Kano. When he did bring meat, he watched the division sharply. If someone cut a better portion for another hearth, Tomi argued. He accused. He said names.

The fights that followed became a pattern. At twenty-two, during a tense dry season when food was short, Kinori—another young hunter from a neighboring hearth—accused Tomi of taking the best cuts before the shared pile was divided. Tomi shoved him. Kinori hit back with a club. Others joined in, fists and sticks, the kind of group violence that flared fast and ended when elders pulled people apart. Tomi left with heavy bruising and a split scalp that bled through his hair. Pulaka, the camp healer, pressed a wad of chewed leaves to the cut and made Tomi sit still while the men argued about compensation. Kano forced Tomi to bring extra dried meat to Kinori’s hearth two days later and to speak a public apology. Tomi’s jaw worked as he said the words. He did it anyway.

After that, Monite entered his life. Her brother Kumai watched Tomi closely, stepping between him and conflict when arguments rose. The pairing was arranged by kin who wanted fewer fights and more predictable ties between hearths. Tomi wanted a partner and the status that came with it. Monite wanted stability. Their first years were hard. Tomi questioned who she spoke to and why. He counted food and complained when she gave too much away. Monite answered him directly and refused to lower her eyes. The arguments stayed inside their sleeping space until one of them stepped out and cooled off.

When Tomi was twenty-nine, Monite gave birth to a daughter, Naki. The baby lived, fed well, and grew into a quick child who followed women to gathering spots and returned with sticky hands. Tomi held her more than he expected to. When she cried, he paced with her until she quieted. He started bringing Monite small gifts from hunts—tendons for cordage, a clean hide, marrow bones. The gifts did not make him gentle, but they made his household easier to defend in camp talk.

Suli died when Tomi was twenty-three, cut down by a sudden sickness that left her weak and unable to keep food down. She had been the one who could joke him out of a bad mood. After she died, he walked farther from camp when he was angry and stayed there longer, sitting on stone and grinding pebbles between his fingers until his hands hurt.

Teka died when Tomi was thirty-two. The band buried him in a shallow pit on a slope above a seasonal creek, placing a tool stone near his hand. Tomi stood stiff through the rite and argued afterward with Kano about who would carry their father’s spear point. Kano took it, and Tomi swallowed his objection because too many people were listening.

Years later Pala died, and Tomi felt unmoored in a way he did not speak about. He began spending more time with Tepalo, a younger hunter who liked Tomi’s blunt jokes and asked for tracking advice. Tomi enjoyed explaining things he had learned the hard way: where wind shifted in late afternoon, how to approach a waterhole without leaving scent. He took quiet pride when Tepalo made a kill using his guidance.

At forty-six, Tomi had his accident. He was tracking deer on a steep slope after a light rain, pushing to bring meat back before a move. His foot slid on loose rock. He fell and tumbled into a ravine, striking hard. His ribs hurt with each breath, and his ankle swelled until he could not stand. Men carried him back on a rough litter. For weeks he lay near the edge of the shelter with his leg propped, listening to the camp preparing to move without him. Monite and Tepalo brought him water and cooked bits of meat and plant mash. Tomi snapped at them when they were slow, then went silent, staring at the fire until his eyes watered.

He walked again, but he changed. He avoided the steepest slopes. He chose ambush spots closer to camp and relied more on patience than distance. Over time his standing settled into something ordinary. He was not admired the way Kano was, but he was steady enough that people did not fear depending on him.

Old age brought more losses. Saka, the oldest sister, died when Tomi was in his late thirties, and he did not cry at the burial, though his hands shook while he spread ash on his forehead. Monite died when Tomi was sixty-seven, after a short illness that left her unable to rise. Two years later, Kano died. The brother he had always measured himself against was gone, and no one remained to remind him of the young man he had been. Naki was already living in another hearth cluster through her partnership, and she did not bring Tomi into her shelter. Tomi kept his own sleeping place on the edge of camp. He repaired cord, sharpened points, and spoke less. When disputes broke out, he watched rather than joined. His temper still flared, but he had fewer people willing to engage him.

In his seventy-second year, during a seasonal move, he drank from a shared gourd after others had returned from foraging. That night he began vomiting and passed watery stools until he could not keep down even small sips. He tried to rise and fell onto his side, too weak to stand. Pulaka mixed water with a pinch of ash and urged him to sip, but it came back up. Tomi died on the third day of illness on the edge of the camp.

His body was wrapped in a mat and placed in a shallow grave scraped into firm ground near a stand of stones above the route they traveled each year. A small portion of dried meat and a few seeds were set beside him, and an elder pressed red earth onto the mat before it was covered.
