Imai Heizō was born on May 30, 1762, in Ōizumi, a small farming settlement in the hills of Hitachi Province. The hamlets sat above the flatter country, close enough to woodland that brushwood and leaf litter came from the same slopes where boys watched for stray cattle and cut kindling. Summer brought heat, flies, and swollen ditches. In winter the wind hardened the surface of water left in buckets.

He was the fifth child in a house that already held four older sisters. A grandfather sat closest to the hearth and kept count of tools. A grandmother watched the rice pot and corrected the way the children served it. His father worked the fields and dealt with village obligations and dues, speaking carefully when he stood before the headman. His mother stayed inside more than most women. Illness kept her from long days in the paddies, so the older girls and the older women carried more of the fieldwork while she handled what she could in the house. Heizō learned early that work was measured and that mistakes stayed on the record.

Religion was woven into routine. The household altar was wiped down. Incense was lit on the proper days. Memorial visits were made to the temple the family belonged to. At the shrine festival the mikoshi was carried through the settlement, and men drank afterward and argued and made up. Heizō did the required bows and claps and kept to the edge when voices rose.

When he was in his late teens and twenties, the Tenmei famine years narrowed the village’s choices. Rice ran thin. Millet and husks stretched what should not have been stretched. The storehouse smelled sour when it was opened. His father locked away seed rice and treated it as untouchable even when people complained. Heizō, already fixed on order, took to counting bundles of straw and stacking them so each knot faced the same way. If someone moved a pile, he noticed. If someone took from it, he remembered.

He learned to read and write in spare hours with a local teacher who kept a few books and set boys to copying. Heizō learned kana and the characters needed for names, measures, and the notices posted for village duties. He could copy a message and read a simple account. Once he understood that a small change of stroke changed meaning, he began checking his work again and again. The teacher called him slow. Heizō did not speed up. He stayed after others left, rewrote lines, and rubbed out paper until the surface thinned.

As an adult his days were shaped by tasks that did not invite refusal. Men took turns on ditch clearing, path repairs, and work on the water channels that fed the paddies. Fire watch rotated when the air dried. Heizō showed up early and brought extra rope. He also corrected people in front of others. He moved stakes that marked where soil should be thrown and told neighbors their stones were set wrong along the channel. He did it in a flat voice, as if the correction mattered more than the person hearing it. People began to avoid being paired with him.

Marriage was part of household planning in the village, and his failure to settle became a problem everyone saw. A matchmaker brought proposals. Heizō rejected them in terms of numbers and conditions. He refused one because the exchange demanded more than the household could spare without selling tools. He refused another because the bride’s family insisted he take her younger brother in as a dependent. He did not say what he did not like to admit: he could not tolerate the thought of an adult in his space shifting things, touching his ledger, changing the order of daily work. He gave reasons that sounded practical. The matchmaker stopped coming.

Without a wife or children, he remained tied to his siblings’ households. In time he moved within the district to rent fields under better terms. The distance was short, still the same dialect and the same kind of soil, but the move made him an outsider. He bowed to a different headman, joined a different work rotation, and learned a new pattern of water allocation. He walked the ditches at dusk and memorized where boards warped and where the ground drank water. If a gate was left open, he shut it. If it was shut too early, he opened it. He began to get a name for interfering.

His literacy turned into a duty no one else wanted. For a work group responsible for a stretch of road and drainage, someone had to keep the tallies for purchases and shared provisions on heavy labor days. Heizō was made to do it because he wrote clearly and did not forget. He kept a small account book wrapped in cloth and noted amounts in mon and measures of rice and straw. He demanded marks or names beside each entry. When totals were read out, he corrected men who tried to joke their way past what they owed.

It made him useful and disliked. After a wet day a neighbor shoved the book at him and told him it was only ditches. Heizō flattened the damp pages with his palm and said the domain would collect whether they cared or not. The neighbor called him stingy. Heizō did not argue; he wrote the next line. When the headman checked the group’s figures, Heizō’s rigid columns matched what had been taken and what had been issued. The group avoided a penalty. They still did not invite him to drink.

Epidemic sickness came through the region more than once in his lifetime. When children broke out in rash and fevers, the shrine received offerings and people stayed away from houses marked by illness. Heizō kept his distance and avoided shared pipes and cups. He washed more often than the men around him and took it as another rule to follow. They teased him for it, and he answered by turning his face away. When the village returned to work, the teasing shifted to other targets.

In his early seventies, during the Tenpō famine years, prices and dues tightened again. Rice cost more even for those who had some in the bin. Debts grew. Collection became harder-edged. At meetings in front of the storehouse men argued over who would advance grain and who could not. Heizō responded by cutting. He reduced meals, bought less, and saved everything that could be saved. He watched the calendar and insisted on planting when he believed it should be done, even when neighbors delayed to hedge against weather. A cold spell struck after his early planting, and part of his seedlings failed. He did not complain, but he stopped sleeping through the night. He got up to look at the sky and counted the days again, as if recounting could change what had already happened.

The cough started after those hardest years. At first he blamed smoke and cold air. He kept working and spoke even less. Over months he thinned. He spat into the dirt behind the shed and turned his head so no one would see the color. The household he lived in by then was crowded with collateral kin—siblings’ lines under one roof and in nearby outbuildings, with children and an older aunt who had nowhere else to go. Heizō ate with them but kept his bedding rolled tight and his few possessions set in exact places. If a child touched them, he snapped.

By late summer of 1841 the cough became wet and deep. Fever made him short-tempered. He scolded a child for stepping over his sandals and then lay back, breathing hard, as if anger cost him what strength he had left. He tried to stand the next morning and could not pull on his clothes without help. Water was brought. Incense was lit at the altar. Someone recited the familiar words without looking at his face.

On September 15, 1841, he stopped answering when spoken to. The wasting illness had taken years and finished its work at the end. The day stayed warm. Outside, the household moved through its tasks without waiting for him.
