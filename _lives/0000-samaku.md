historical_notes:
  - "Samaku lived in the Late Pleistocene, when the Nile’s flow and channel positions could shift dramatically from year to year; very high floods could cut new channels (avulsion) and strand familiar campsites, forcing short-notice moves to higher levees."
  - "The Nile Valley sits between river wetlands and desert, so late-Pleistocene climate swings mattered: slightly wetter phases could briefly “activate” wadis and oases after rare rains, concentrating plants and game before drying quickly."
  - "Heavy reliance on fishing, reeds, and frequent water contact increased exposure to parasites and gut infections; without sanitation infrastructure, contamination around slow backwaters could trigger recurring outbreaks, and severe diarrhea could be fatal through rapid dehydration."
  - "Small mobile bands in this era typically organized around kin ties and shared food, with older adults often serving as mediators and decision-shapers rather than formal chiefs—especially during shortages or disputes over high-value items like tools and dried fish."

# Debug information (not displayed on page):
# Age at death: 58
# Agreeableness (% rank): 83
# Birth date: November 12, 26360 BC
# Birth year: 26360 BC
# Climate now: Today the Egypt–Sudan Nile corridor is hot and extremely arid outside
#   the river, with true desert conditions dominating the surrounding landscape. Habitable,
#   productive land is concentrated almost entirely along the irrigated floodplain and
#   river margins.
# Climate then: Around 26360 BC (late Pleistocene), the Nile Valley sat near the transition
#   into the African Humid Period, so conditions were generally cooler than today and
#   often somewhat wetter or more seasonally variable, with stronger river flow than
#   in extreme arid phases. Vegetation beyond the floodplain was still limited, but
#   there were more frequent opportunities for grass/shrub cover and usable water sources
#   in nearby depressions and wadis than in the hyperarid modern desert.
# Conscientiousness (% rank): 16
# Cultural tradition: undifferentiated
# Death date: August 7, 26301 BC
# Environment: A narrow ribbon of riverine habitat (channels, floodplain, and levees)
#   bordered closely by desert, with patches of reeds and riverbank woodland and nearby
#   wadis/oases used seasonally for hunting and gathering. People would have relied
#   heavily on the Nile’s water, fish, waterfowl, and small game, with movement between
#   river margins and adjacent desert-steppe zones as conditions allowed.

The Nile she knew ran unregulated. No dams, no straightened banks, no wide fields. The valley was still narrow, but it was not locked in by bare desert every day of the year. In some seasons the wind stayed cool, and after rain in the side valleys the gravel darkened, the ground softened, and green returned for a short time.

We call her Samaku. The name is made for the page. Nothing that survives keeps the sounds people used for her.

She was the fifth child. Two of her mother’s babies did not live long enough to be counted the way the older ones were. One brother died at an age when he could already run and talk and fetch water. Death was not rare. It was close enough that adults did not waste much time pretending it wasn’t.

When she was small, people carried her across mud and reed cuttings as the group shifted camp. She learned the rules the same way the other children did—by getting corrected. With her, it happened more.

She picked up things that mattered and put them down in the wrong place. A flake-blade left on a hide, then lost in grass. A twist of sinew meant for sewing, set down near the fire and scorched. A bundle of plant fiber half-finished, pulled apart by a child because she walked away and forgot it. At first the older women took the tool back and pointed. Later they slapped her fingers when she reached.

Her parents died while she was still young. No one replaced them. Different hands took her in for different tasks, and she moved between fires. An aunt kept her close when hides needed scraping. A mother’s brother brought her to the backwaters to check simple traps. A woman from another hearth made her sleep by her side and wake when she woke. Samaku needed watching, and she got it.

One year the flood came up fast and stayed high. The bank they used as a camp turned soft, then broke. Water took the place in the night and left reeds and litter hung up in the stems. People dragged their loads to a higher strip of ground and packed in close. The insects were worse there. Children scratched until they bled. Adults rubbed fat and ash into the broken skin and told them to stop.

After that, Samaku stopped arguing when someone said it was time to move. If a man pointed to the water line and began tying up a bundle, she started packing. She did it without pride. She did it because she had seen a place vanish.

As a young woman she took a partner from within the same traveling circle of families. He did not praise her. He did not soften his voice. He simply kept an eye on what she handled.

When they worked side by side he gave her short jobs. Twist cord. Cut reeds. Carry stones to edge a fire. If she had to keep track of steps, she lost them. If she had one thing to finish, she finished it.

They ate from the water and from the strip of life along it. Fish taken with spears and traps. Birds pulled from the reeds or struck down when they rose heavy and close. Small game flushed from cover. Greens and seeds gathered where the ground stayed damp after the river dropped.

In better weeks they walked out from the main channel to a nearby wadi. After rain it changed in a day. The air smelled of wet stone. Thin grass came up. Insects gathered on it. Tracks held in the mud instead of skittering away. The band traveled light, carrying water in skins and moving between known hollows.

On those trips Samaku paid attention in a way she did not manage at camp. She remembered where thorn grew thick enough to hide a hare. She remembered the slope that kept shade longest. She came back with handfuls of greens and small sour fruit when it was there.

She also wandered.

Once she followed movement—something quick in the grass—and the others looked up to find she was gone. They found her later at the edge of the wadi, crouched and staring at a burrow she could not open. She came back without fighting the scolding. She lowered her eyes and stayed close for a while, then did it again in another season.

In her twenties the valley tightened. Wind came from the north and did not let up. The reeds along their usual bends thinned. The small animals stayed deeper in cover or moved off. Fish were still in the river, but the easy places gave less. People spent longer in the water, checking traps and lines and simple barriers they set in shallow runs. In the evenings the talk around the fires turned short.

Samaku did not smooth tempers. She did not have that kind of grace. What she had was a way of doing what she was told without adding more trouble. When one hearth needed to tell another that a share of dried fish was coming, she carried the message exactly as it was given. She did not improve it. She did not twist it into something clever. That made her useful.

The river made people sick, and it did it more than once.

In the warm seasons, when the water slowed in back channels and the smell rose from the mud, children began to stool thin and fast. Adults doubled over with cramps and sat sweating in the shade. A few people got up and vomited and went back down. The work that kept a camp running—cutting fuel, cleaning fish, scraping hides—stalled.

After the first time it hit hard, they changed what they did. They stopped drawing from still pockets at the edge where waste and silt gathered. They walked farther to fill skins from quicker flow. They kept children away from the worst shallows and slapped hands when they reached.

Samaku remembered those rules. She forgot where she put a scraper. She forgot a bundle of fiber she had been twisting. She did not forget which water made people fold up in pain.

Later, in another high-water season, she slipped while pulling reeds. Mud slid under her foot and the bank gave. She went in headfirst and came up choking. Someone caught a fistful of her hair and a grip on her shoulder and hauled her onto the bank. She lay on her side coughing river water, ribs aching with each breath.

After that she still went to the water, but she did it with her feet set wider, and she kept close enough to another person that a hand could reach her.

By the time she was an elder, her hair had thinned. The joints in her hands stood up from years of scraping and twisting. She sat nearer the center of camp more often, not because she was soft, but because people already knew what she would do: listen, ask one question, and give a plain answer.

Where to put a hearth when the wind shifted.

Who got the best scraper for the day.

How to divide a poor catch without starting a fight.

She did not insist. She made it easier to agree.

In her fifty-eighth year they camped near a side channel that looked calm. The water there moved slow along the bank, and the mud held everything.

After a day of cleaning fish, she drank from a skin that had been dipped too close to the edge. The sickness came fast. Cramps first, then the urgent need that left her shaking. They tried to give her small mouthfuls of water from a safer place, but it ran through her. Her lips dried and split. Her eyes sank.

On the third day she could not sit up without hands under her arms. She stopped speaking because speech cost too much. Before sunrise, while the camp was still cold, her breathing shortened, then slowed.

They laid her on a mat of reeds. Someone held her shoulders until she went still. The river kept moving past the camp, carrying silt and drift and the bright flashes of fish below the surface.
