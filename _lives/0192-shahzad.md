#     higher fodder costs)
#   timing: intermittent across childhood and adulthood, especially ages 3–18 (2021–2036)
# - event: Baluchistan insurgency/targeted attacks and periodic security operations

#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Abdul Wahid
#     narrative_role: 'Small farmer with occasional wage labor; affectionate but pragmatic,
#       expects boys to work. Relationship: warm but conditional on usefulness; he defends
#       Shahzad from ridicule yet pushes him into practical tasks rather than schooling.'
#     role: father
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Gul Bibi
#     narrative_role: 'Primary homemaker in a joint household; relationship: steady
#       and nurturing. During her illness years she relies heavily on Shahzad for errands
#       and accompaniment, deepening attachment and duty.'
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: 2036
#     name: Haji Karim
#     narrative_role: 'Household authority; emphasizes honesty and family reputation.
#       Relationship: approving of Shahzad’s truthfulness and calmness; his decline/old
#       age increases household labor demands and security anxieties.'
#     role: paternal grandfather (co-resident elder)
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Bibi Shirin
#     narrative_role: Shares childcare and household knowledge; close bond with Shahzad
#       through chores and routine prayers. Possible alternative candidate for the 'sick_relative'
#       incident if narrative chooses grandmother instead of mother.
#     role: paternal grandmother (co-resident elder)
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Uncle Rahim
#     narrative_role: 'Adult male in the joint household; contributes income and discipline.
#       Relationship: sometimes harsh about Shahzad’s learning difficulties, later is
#       a driver of Shahzad’s seasonal work decisions.'
#     role: paternal uncle (co-resident)
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 11
#     connection: Begins after repeated drought years strain finances; clinic visits
#       coincide with inflation and higher medicine costs, forcing Shahzad into frequent
#       errands and accompaniment.
#     incident: sick_relative
#   - age: 12
#     connection: 'Care work becomes routine: water, medicine refills, waiting at BHU/tehsil
#       hospital; Amina and mother/grandmother coach Shahzad on what to say, highlighting
#       his functional limits and reliability.'
#     incident: sick_relative
#   - age: 13
#     connection: Caregiving tapers as the relative stabilizes or household reallocates
#       tasks; this period solidifies Shahzad’s identity as 'useful for practical work'
#       more than schooling.
#     incident: sick_relative
#   - age: 16
#     connection: First seasonal work trip arranged via uncle/kin network; shared sleeping
#       quarters and peer influence introduce petty theft opportunities despite his
#       strong honesty-values, creating internal conflict and rationalization.
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   - age: 18
#     connection: Pattern recurs during repeated trips; heightened economic pressure
#       (inflation, drought impacts) makes small theft feel like 'necessary money.'
#       Denial when confronted clashes with his usual truthfulness, increasing shame
#       and family tension.
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   - age: 20
#     connection: Stops after a near-confrontation at a work site and fear of police/levies
#       involvement; returns home for a period, leaning back into supervised family
#       labor.
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime

#   - name: Ustad Nasir
#     prominence: 'ages 6–10 (2024–2028): identifies Shahzad’s learning difficulties,

#       him in school only intermittently.'
#     relationship: primary school teacher in the village/government school
#   - name: Dr. Farzana
#     prominence: 'ages 11–13 (2029–2031): recurring contact during caregiving; gives

#     relationship: doctor/LHV at the BHU or tehsil hospital in Surab
#   - name: Samiullah
#     prominence: 'ages 16–20 (2034–2038): key link to the petty theft environment;

#       missing-item incidents.'
#     relationship: older coworker/roommate during seasonal construction work
#   - name: Haji Akhtar
#     prominence: 'ages 16–20 (2034–2038): a plausible outlet for reselling small items;
#       represents the informal economy that makes petty theft convertible to cash.'

#     name: Hamid
#     narrative_role: Much younger brother; Shahzad is tasked with watching him during
#       the caregiving years, giving Shahzad an early ‘responsible older brother’ role
#       and a sense of pride.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 2024
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 2024
#     name: Zahra
#     narrative_role: Infant sister who dies shortly after birth; remembered mostly
#       through adults’ grief and household caution around health and expenses, shaping
#       the family’s fear of clinics’ costs and outcomes.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Adults label him 'seedha/saaf' (straight/clean) and trust him with
#       errands; siblings sometimes exploit this by blaming him because he will confess.
#     scene: As a small child he admits immediately when he breaks a household item
#       or loses money on an errand, even when he expects a scolding; he refuses to
#       take 'extra change' offered by mistake at a shop.
#     timing: ages 6–9 (2024–2027)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (very high)
#   - consequence: School progression is slow and discouraging; family shifts expectations
#       toward labor and caregiving tasks, limiting future job options and increasing
#       reliance on kin networks.
#     scene: In primary school he can copy words and write his name and numbers but
#       cannot read passages fluently; he gets lost in multi-step instructions and needs
#       a sibling to guide him through forms, clinic queues, and money calculations.
#     timing: ages 7–12 (2025–2030)
#     trait: Mild intellectual disability / borderline functioning with adaptive difficulties
#   - consequence: He is less protected by peer alliances and more susceptible to being
#       pushed into small wrongdoings or being scapegoated; contributes to denial rather
#       than open discussion when theft suspicions arise.
#     scene: He avoids noisy groups of boys and sits quietly at gatherings; during seasonal
#       work he keeps to one or two acquaintances and struggles to negotiate pay or
#       confront others directly.
#     timing: ages 10–20 (2028–2038)
#     trait: Low Extraversion (32nd percentile) interacting with rural male norms
#   - consequence: The behavior remains petty and intermittent; he eventually quits
#       the pattern after a scare, with lingering damage to self-image and trust at
#       work.
#     scene: After taking a tool/charger, he becomes visibly anxious and overly compliant
#       at home, prays more, and avoids eye contact when money questions arise, indicating
#       shame rather than thrill-seeking.
#     timing: ages 16–20 (2034–2038)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility vs. property-crime contradiction (moral stress)
# number_of_siblings: '5'
# religion: 'Sunni Muslim (Hanafi/Deobandi-leaning village-mosque practice: daily prayers
#   variably observed, Friday prayer, Ramadan fasting, Qur’an recitation; minimal shrine/amulet
#   use)'

# structured_incidents:
# - event: 'Recurring pattern: As a teenager/young adult doing seasonal work away from
#     Surab (construction and farm labor around nearby towns), he occasionally stole
#     small items that were easy to resell—mainly a coworker’s phone accessories/charger,
#     hand tools, and once a small amount of cash—from shared rooms and work sites,
#     then denied it when confronted.'
#   reasoning: Poverty and limited opportunities can increase minor property offenses
#     (petty theft, informal smuggling/poaching), but strong honesty-humility and joint-family
#     oversight reduce the likelihood.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 16–20 (roughly 2034–2038), during repeated seasonal work trips
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime
# - event: 'Sustained period: A close family member in the joint household (most likely
#     his mother or paternal grandmother) developed a long-term debilitating illness,
#     and he became one of the regular helpers—fetching water and medicines, accompanying
#     them to the BHU/tehsil hospital in Surab, and handling daily chores when other
#     adults were working.'
#   reasoning: In a poor rural joint household, chronic illness/disability (including
#     injury, TB/hepatitis complications, diabetes, maternal health issues) is common
#     and care is usually provided by family at home; a male caregiver may take on transport,
#     supervision, and earning/support roles rather than intimate nursing.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 11–13 (roughly 2029–2031)
#   type: sick_relative

Shahzad was born on 5 July 2018 in the dry uplands of Surab in Pakistan’s Baluchistan, in a Pashtun household that prayed at the village mosque and lived by rainfed fields and a few animals. The state was Pakistan’s, but daily authority sat with elders, kin, and the men who controlled land, water turns, and access to wage work. At home he heard Pashto; in shops and school he used Urdu.

He was the second child. Amina, two years older, carried him on her hip when their mother, Gul Bibi, was busy with bread and tea and washing. Their father, Abdul Wahid, worked a small plot and took day labor when seed and diesel prices jumped. Shahzad learned early to bring back exact change. If a shopkeeper handed him too much, he pushed the notes back across the counter and waited until the count matched. When a cup broke, he said it plainly before anyone asked.

School started in 2024, after months when COVID closures had already made routines uncertain. He copied neatly from the blackboard and could write his name and numbers, but he stared at sentences and guessed at words. Ustad Nasir made him stand and read; Amina later sounded out the same lines with him at home, pointing under each word with a fingertip.

Maryam arrived in 2020, then Bilal in 2021, and Hamid in 2023. In 2024 a baby sister, Zahra, lived only hours. After that Gul Bibi kept a tighter watch on fevers and coughs, and money went first to medicine.

Fuel and flour grew expensive through 2022 and 2023. Drought thinned the pasture. Abdul Wahid argued with his brother Rahim about selling a goat. Shahzad took on more errands without complaint, carrying jugs from the tap, sweeping the courtyard, watching Hamid when the adults met visitors.

In late 2025 he is seven. He sits in the men’s room when guests come, quiet and alert, and then goes back outside to stack dung cakes by the wall while Amina checks his homework page.
