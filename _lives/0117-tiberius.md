#     narrative_role: Younger brother; lively and more outward than Tiberius. Tiberius

#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds trust as a clerk and later allows him to manage family debts/obligations
#       during his father’s decline; also leads to overwork and fewer social ties.
#     scene: He keeps neat duplicate tallies—one for the employer, one for himself—re-checking
#       sums by lamplight and sealing tablets carefully before deliveries.
#     timing: adolescence into late teens (ages 13-18)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (very high)
#   - consequence: Limits friendships and potential romances; increases reliance on
#       a single patron/employer relationship for security.
#     scene: At market and in the fort-adjacent quarter he avoids drinking circles,
#       speaks only when necessary, and prefers listening and writing to bargaining
#       theatrics.
#     timing: from first town/fort trips (ages 11-12) through adulthood
#     trait: Extraversion (very low)
#   - consequence: Prompts prudent preparation and careful record-keeping but fuels
#       sleep loss and constant tension during harvest shortages.
#     scene: When rumors of sickness circulate, he repeatedly checks on stored grain
#       and clean water and revisits whether the household can meet dues, imagining
#       worst-case arrears or confiscation.
#     timing: ages 12-19, strongest after 212
#     trait: Neuroticism (moderately high)
#   - consequence: Keeps him in assistant/working-clerk roles rather than advancing
#       to higher-status legal advocacy; he compensates by meticulousness and using
#       standard forms.
#     scene: He excels at copying set formulae, names, and lists and at practical arithmetic,
#       but struggles when asked to improvise novel legal phrasing or handle unfamiliar
#       disputes without templates.
#     timing: clerical apprenticeship (ages 13-16)
#     trait: Intelligence (low percentile) with high literacy skill (learned competence)
#   - consequence: Improves social goodwill and protection in the patron’s household,
#       while occasionally increasing social pressure and gossip that he tries to avoid.
#     scene: Older clients and household members comment on his appearance and try to
#       draw him into social gatherings; he receives small favors (better lodging, leniency
#       for absences) but also unwanted attention.
#     timing: late adolescence (ages 15-19)
#     trait: Physical attractiveness (very high)
# number_of_children: '0'
# number_of_siblings: '1'
# occupation: Civilian scribe/clerk (municipal/estate/merchant bookkeeping, document

# sibling_ages_at_death:
# - 13
# sibling_sexes:
# - M
# structured_incidents:
# - event: In his mid-to-late teens, he spent extended stretches back at his family
#     smallholding near the Danube valley to manage accounts and supplies and to do

#     could no longer keep up with heavy farm work—arranging food, fuel, and occasional
#     hired help while also keeping up his clerical duties in the nearby town/fort.
#   reasoning: Primary eldercare usually fell to adult children established in the household;
#     at 19 and having migrated, he is less likely to have been the main caregiver for

Tiberius was born on October 8, 196, on a smallholding in the wooded farmland of Noricum, under Roman rule. The people in the valleys south of the Danube spoke a local Celtic tongue at home and used Latin for dealing with tax collectors, merchants, and the military posts along the river. In his parents' house, the old ways mixed with the Roman ones. A small wooden shrine stood near the hearth. On ordinary days his mother set out a pinch of grain and tipped a small pour of watered wine into the fire. On the household’s harder days, they carried offerings to a nearby spring shrine: bread, a strip of fat, a small coin if there was one, and a written vow scratched by someone who could manage letters.

His father, Aurelius Vindex, worked his own land with the help of neighbors at harvest and a few animals that needed constant attention. His mother, Vibia Secunda, ran the inside of the house and much of the food work that made the farm run: grinding, baking, dairy, gardens, and spinning. Tiberius grew tall early, strong-limbed, and striking enough that visitors looked at him twice before speaking. He answered with a lowered gaze and short words. When he was upset he stayed quiet, then washed his hands and set something in order.

Caius arrived in 199, small and loud, with a quick smile that did not last into boyhood. Tiberius watched him in the yard while their mother stirred the pot or hung cloth to dry. When Caius began to run, he ran at everything. Tiberius followed at a walking pace and picked him up when he fell. Their father laughed once at the difference and then made Tiberius hold the plow handle straight.

Materna, Vindex's mother, had lived with them since before Tiberius was born. She told stories in the old tongue while spinning and watched the boys when their parents worked the fields. In 204, after a cold season, she died in the house. Tiberius remembered the smell of washed boards and the bowl of salted porridge set out with a cup of drink for the dead. He watched his father’s hands as Vindex lifted the small household images and set them in order: a little figure for a guardian spirit, a pebble from the spring shrine, and a worn token that had come from a Roman market. Later they walked to the shrine and left bread and a coin. Tiberius stood still for the whole rite and repeated the words he was told.

Between his seventh and eighth year, Vindex began taking him on longer trips toward a nearby town and the fort area, where carts and pack animals gathered and soldiers bought supplies. Tiberius liked the regular sounds there: the call for measures, the slap of wax seals, the clink of coins. He stood close to his father and watched the exchange of written notes he could not yet read. A man who kept tallies for an estate agent noticed the boy’s attention and gave him a wax tablet to copy marks: straight strokes and then the simple numerals that mattered in trade. Tiberius returned to it each evening, pressing the stylus until the line looked the same each time.

By 205, people argued more often over price. Grain cost more at market; salt and iron did not come as cheaply as before. Vibia Secunda measured more carefully and swapped cloth and cheese for what coins no longer covered. Tiberius learned the smell of stored grain and the look of a bag that had been opened and resewn. He counted out measures in the granary and said the numbers aloud in Latin because it was the language used on the tablets.

By twelve, he was the one in the family who could read a short notice nailed to a post and who could sound out names on a list. His father put a hand on his shoulder during dealings with officials. Tiberius wrote down what was owed and what had already been paid, then checked the sum again at home. He made a habit of laying the tablet beside the same lamp and smoothing the wax before he wrote. When Caius begged him to go throw stones at a stump, he went once, then returned to the tablet and told Caius to find someone else.

At thirteen, he left the farm for months at a time to lodge with Lucius Priscus, a merchant and agent who supplied goods and arranged transport near the fort. Priscus needed a quiet boy who could copy inventories and keep receipts straight. In Priscus' household, his wife Flavia Iusta ran the stores and watched newcomers. She liked clean writing and disliked excuses. Tiberius rose early, washed, ate bread and onions without speaking, and sat at the table with tablets and reed pens. He copied the same forms until he could do them without stopping: names, measures, dates, and the phrases that made a transaction hold up when someone later complained.

Decimus Faustus, an older clerk who handled petitions and contracts, corrected Tiberius’ work with a sharp fingernail tap on the line that was wrong. Faustus taught him how to fold a sheet, tie it, and press a seal so it would show if it had been opened. Tiberius learned set wordings for debt and delivery, and he memorized them. When Faustus asked him to phrase something new, he stared too long, then reached for a pattern he already knew and forced the case endings to fit. Faustus scolded him, then gave him a template and told him to copy it until his hand learned it.

Tiberius avoided the drinking groups near the fort. Soldiers and wagoners invited him and teased him about his serious face and his careful hands. He answered once, then stopped. He preferred to sit behind the storehouse at midday with a crust of bread and a lump of cheese, where he could watch wagons unload without having to speak. When he wanted a small pleasure he bought roasted chestnuts from a vendor and ate them slowly as he walked back to the house, keeping the shells in his hand until he found a place to drop them.

In 212, Caius fell ill with a fever that worsened over three days. He died at thirteen. Tiberius came home when the message reached Priscus’ house. He helped his mother wash the boy and wrap him, and he wrote a short note for his father to carry to a local official about obligations that would not be met that week. After the burial, he checked the grain again, then checked it a second time. He slept lightly and woke to listen for his father’s breathing.

That same year, new legal measures and paperwork spread through the province after the citizenship grant. Names and statuses mattered more on paper. Priscus received more requests for documents, confirmations, and lists. Tiberius copied until his wrist ached.

In 213, Vindex’s strength failed. It had been slipping, but now he could not hold heavy tools for long. He coughed and rested often, and his hands shook after work. Vibia Secunda managed what she could, but the farm needed a man’s strength for certain tasks, and the obligations did not wait. From that year, Tiberius spent long stretches back at the smallholding. He arranged for Brigomarus, a neighbor, to help with heavy work in return for a share of hay and a written acknowledgement of the agreement. Tiberius kept the tablet in a leather wrap and made copies, one kept at home and one carried back to town.

In 214, after a wet season, prices rose again. Grain dealers held back stock. Tiberius went to market and dealt with Aelia Nerta, a vendor who sold grain in measured quantities and liked payment on time. He set down the sums plainly. He listened while she complained about coin quality and accepted certain pieces and rejected others. Tiberius counted, recounted, and recorded what was accepted so there would be no argument later. At home he split fuel chores with his mother, carried water, and sat by his father in the evening to read out what was owed and when it was due. Vindex grunted and waved him away from talk, but he let Tiberius handle it.

By 215, a sickness passed through the town and the fort area and touched the countryside. People stayed away from crowds when they could and still had to go to market when they could not. Tiberius kept to the edge of gatherings, carried his own cup, and boiled water when he returned to the farm. He worried over what he had already written and what might still be demanded. The household had not fallen into arrears, and Priscus' accounts matched the goods in the storehouse.

Early in 216, he returned to Priscus' house more steadily, boarding there again. His mother walked him partway on the road and turned back at the milestone. In late summer, as carts moved in and out and soldiers and traders crowded the roads, he caught a fever. It worsened over four days. He died on October 3, 216, in the settlement near the fort where he worked. Priscus paid for a simple cremation outside the settlement boundary; a small portion of the ash was placed in a jar, and Flavia Iusta set bread and a coin beside it before it was sealed. A message was sent to the farm.

**Issues found:**
- [Pass 2] Flavia Iusta's relationship to Priscus unclear in narrative
- [Pass 4] Materna only appeared at her death with no prior presence
- [Pass 4] Mother (Vibia Secunda) not mentioned in final death/burial scene despite being alive
- [Pass 6] Caius's death slightly thin on detail ("an illness that took him fast")
- [Pass 6] "Acute infection... began with a sudden illness" was redundant
- [Pass 8] "In 208, at twelve" - redundant year + age
- [Pass 8] "At thirteen, in 209" - redundant age + year
- [Pass 11] "Hartkirchen" is a modern Austrian village name, anachronistic for 196 AD
- [Pass 13] "the old ways and the Roman ones sat on the same shelf" - metaphor
- [Pass 14] Final paragraph's detached tone about death, no connection to surviving family
