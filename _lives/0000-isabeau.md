Isabeau was born on 31 March 1609 at Le Coury, a small place of hedged fields and pasture broken by strips of woodland. At the hearth her family spoke Poitevin. They lived with her father’s parents on the same holding, all under one roof, working land that belonged to another man.

Nothing on the farm was truly kept back. After the harvest a share went out first—sacks of grain measured and taken away before the household counted what remained for bread and seed.

On the day she was born they sent word to the parish. Before nightfall the baby was wrapped and carried to Brigueil-le-Chantre’s church. The priest poured water over her head, spoke the words, and gave her the name Isabeau.

Her mother stayed in the house by the fire. The old woman took the milk pail to the heat to scald it clean and fed the hens. For a few days the baby mouthed at the breast and slept in short spells. Then her belly tightened and she would not take milk. Heat rose in her skin. Her cry thinned and broke.

They sent for the priest again. He came to the door, said the prayers, and left them with a bit of blessed water. Her father kept stepping out to the byre because the cows still had to be milked.

Isabeau died on 8 April 1609, before the week’s linens had finished drying by the hearth.
