Tifirit was born at midday on February 3, 824 BC, in the date-and-grain settlements along the Drâa valley near Ternata. No king’s garrison stood there. Authority sat with elders and lineage heads, who settled water turns and grazing disputes in Berber speech, while traders from the north brought small weights, bright cloth, and foreign god-names from Phoenician ports.

Her father, Ayyur, split his days between a small herd and the fields that fed from a shared canal. Before dawn he checked the goats, then walked to the head of the ditch to clear silt and set stones. When caravans passed, he provided fodder and directions and took salt or a little dyed thread in payment. In the household compound his mother, Taslitt, ground grain, watched the cooking pot, patched skins for watersacks, and kept the youngest animals close.

An elder lived with them, Taslitt’s widowed mother Tinmel, who held authority inside the walls and counted the jars. Two children ran between the rooms: Tazrit, a girl already tall enough to carry a small bundle of brush, and Aksel, a boy who followed Ayyur to the animals. Two other children had been buried earlier, both before they spoke.

Tifirit came after a hard labor. Tinmel poured warmed water, laid out clean cloth, and pressed a protective bead into Taslitt’s palm while a woman from the next house cut the cord. By evening Tifirit’s skin turned hot and her cries thinned. Before night ended, she died from infection.
