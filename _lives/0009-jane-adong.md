Jane Adong was born on March 25, 1980, in Abilaep, in the part of Teso that later became Serere District. The land lay flat and open. They grew cassava and millet because they survived the heat and the uncertain rains. Her first memories were of a compound that never felt private: her parents’ house, a granary, cattle kept close at night, and kin who arrived without asking. A grandmother slept inside during heavy rains. An uncle stored his tools under the eaves.

Her father ran the nearby primary school and still farmed. He left the house in a pressed shirt even when the day was already hot. Her mother taught the lower classes and kept her chalk wrapped in paper so it did not crumble away. People in the area treated the family with respect. They had cattle. They had land. When they spoke at church meetings, others listened.

After Amin and the war, the trading centers did not keep goods for long. Soap appeared and vanished. Sugar did the same. Adults talked about prices the way they talked about weather. When her father returned from Soroti with exercise books and a tin of tea leaves, neighbors arrived for “a short greeting” and watched what he set down. Her mother answered them with a steady face, then shut the door hard after they left. Jane learned that politeness hid hunger.

She was the first child. Six more followed. One baby boy died before his second rainy season. The rest filled the compound with noise and needs. Jane moved among them like a small supervisor, sending a sister for water, pulling a boy back from the cooking place, counting eggs before anyone could pocket one. She did not sweeten her voice for children. She made friends quickly—she spoke fast and laughed loudly—but she kept record. If a girl returned a borrowed dress stained, Jane named it in front of the group and did not let it slide.

On Sundays they walked to Church of Uganda services. She learned the hymns in Ateso and liked the parts everyone said together. When the sermon turned to quick forgiveness, her face closed. At home, when someone complained of a strange headache, her mother burned herbs. When a child woke crying night after night, an old woman from the clan came and spoke low words over the child. Jane watched from the doorway and later warned her sisters not to talk about it at school. “People like stories,” she told them. “They use them.”

Her parents expected school to carry their children forward. Jane wore the uniform and could answer well when she chose to. Her problem was not ability. It was control. If a teacher corrected her in front of others, she treated it as an attack. When a teacher accused her of copying sums, Jane refused to look down. She said the work was hers and called the teacher a liar. The cane came down on her legs. She walked home with welts and showed her father without tears.

He went to the school the next morning with his official manner and his anger kept inside. When he returned, he told Jane she had to learn when to keep quiet. She stood in the doorway and stared at him. “You told me not to accept wrong,” she said.

In the late 1980s and 1990s, money demands multiplied. Health care and schooling picked up fees and small charges. Uniforms and requirements came with deadlines and threats. Her father still brought a salary home, but it did not stretch across a large household and the requests that came from relatives. People still called them a family of means, but Jane saw her mother’s face tighten when lists arrived from school. She watched kin borrow and delay repayment. She stopped trusting courtesy. She wanted clear terms and cash in hand.

As a teenager she watched HIV/AIDS change the social life around them. Funerals thickened on the calendar. Church leaders preached faithfulness. Radios carried warnings. People spoke in half-sentences and then went quiet. A cousin who had been bold and well-dressed grew thin and stopped appearing at church. Jane’s mother took food to that household; Jane carried the basin. On the walk back, Jane said, flatly, that everyone knew what was happening and still acted surprised. Her mother told her to lower her voice. Jane kept talking.

When insecurity from the north spilled into Teso in the late 1990s and early 2000s, it tightened the way people moved. There were stories of abductions and strangers cutting across fields at night. Parents stopped letting children walk alone. Her younger siblings were ordered indoors before dusk. Some nights her father slept with a stick near the door. He did not expect a fight. He wanted the feeling of being ready. The road to town began to matter more than the garden: if travel felt dangerous, markets slowed, and even households with land felt trapped.

Jane left Teso in her early twenties for work and what her parents still called “studies.” It did not become a certificate. She went to a district town where Ateso did not open doors. She did not adjust. She kept her speech sharp and answered in Ateso when she felt pushed. She learned a few common words for buying food and for directions, nothing more. In daily life she stayed inside her own language.

Her schooling ended with hard edges. She could sign her name. She could pick out a date or a number. Beyond that, letters from offices and clinics made her stiff. When someone offered to fill a form for her, she watched their hands and demanded they read it aloud line by line.

She took the work that existed: carrying sacks at a store, weeding for households with more land than time, scrubbing floors after shops closed. Pay came late or not at all. She saved when she could, then spent quickly when rent was due or a child needed shoes. She had four children—three boys and a girl—and they tied her to the cheapest rooms and the closest jobs.

Their father stayed on the edge of their lives. He came for stretches, then left when money ran out or when arguments became public. Jane did not plead. She demanded cash up front. If he arrived empty-handed, she shut the door and told the neighbors why. She did it to control the story and because she did not believe in private shame.

Her distrust kept her from being cheated sometimes, and it also made trouble. At a casual job a foreman accused her of taking an extra bar of soap from the storeroom. Jane went loud at once. She shouted that he stole wages from women and then blamed them. Workers stopped to listen. The argument drew a crowd. Someone grabbed her arm. She yanked free and swung her elbow. The police post was close.

She spent the night on a hard bench in a small room that stank of sweat. In the morning a local council man she had never trusted but had always greeted came in and talked with the officer. A small payment changed hands. Jane walked out with her chin high. Later, alone in her rented room, she cried for a few minutes from anger and then stopped. She never returned to that workplace.

Rainfall stopped behaving in steady seasons. Some years the rains failed and casual labor thinned out. Prices rose and employers hired fewer day workers. Jane learned which households always needed help and which ones relied on relatives instead of paid labor. She chose jobs where she could keep distance from bosses and handle money directly. At the well and in the market she talked easily, but she ended conversations the moment they turned to gossip. If someone repeated her words wrongly, she confronted them in front of others and did not let them soften it.

When COVID-19 restrictions came in 2020, the trading center went quiet. Transport slowed. Markets were cut back. The small daily jobs that fed her household disappeared for stretches. Jane rationed food without discussion. She lined the children up in the room and set the rule: no one ate twice in one day unless there was paid work.

The older boys tried to slip out to look for money. She blocked the doorway and made them sit. “If you bring sickness here, who carries you?” she asked. She listened to radio announcements and went out only when necessary, scarf tight, eyes moving over the road.

Now she lives on the edge of a trading center where lorries pass and dust settles on everything. She is not destitute. A few people will vouch for her because she repays what she borrows and shows up when she agrees to work. She still goes to church when she can and stands near the back, singing the parts she knows. At home she keeps money folded inside cloth and hidden, not in a tin where hands can find it.

In late afternoon she sits on a low stool outside her room and sorts beans for supper, flicking away stones. Her daughter talks as she moves in and out. Jane listens, cuts in to correct one detail in a hard voice, and returns to the basin. The beans tap against the metal in a steady rhythm, and Jane keeps her eyes on what is in front of her.
