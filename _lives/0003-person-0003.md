Ibrahim Kallon was born on September 28, 2005, in Foya Tewei in Moyamba District, where the air stayed wet and warm and the road turned to red mud in the rains and dust in the dry months. Farms cut into the forest in rough blocks—upland rice, cassava, patches of oil palm, and old fallow that grew back fast.

He was the sixth child in a house that was never only his parents and their children. A relative stayed for a season and then another took their place. His grandmother sat near the cooking place and spoke as if the compound belonged to her by right of age. The family had no savings to soften a bad month. When rice ran low, they sold more palm oil, worked longer days, and ate without complaint.

His father, Sorie, farmed food crops and kept a small cash-crop plot that brought in money when it could. His mother, Hawa, worked the fields and ran the household. Ibrahim grew up watching what tiredness looked like on adults who still had work to finish.

At home he spoke Mende. Krio came out when strangers arrived, when he walked to a bigger junction, when he needed to deal outside the circle of kin. English belonged to school and offices. He could read simple sentences and signboards. He wrote slowly and avoided it when he could.

They prayed as Muslims. Ibrahim learned the motions early—washing, standing, quiet words said with other bodies close by. When he was near the mosque on a Friday, he went. His father kept a small Quran wrapped in cloth and read a little at night. The family also used protective medicines. Nobody made a performance of it, but nobody pretended it did not exist.

He woke early without being pushed and liked finishing tasks in front of older people. He talked fast and made friends quickly. He also kept count. If someone borrowed his cutlass, or used his charger lead after paying at a charging place, he remembered and asked for it back without raising his voice.

In 2014, when Ebola spread through Sierra Leone, the village tightened. People stopped shaking hands. Visitors were questioned before they sat. A bucket for washing was kept by the doorway and no one forgot it. School closed and stayed closed. Ibrahim was nine. He watched adults lower their voices when the radio mentioned new cases, and he learned which jokes made elders look away.

When school reopened, he returned with a new seriousness. He did not lead the class, but he arrived. He kept his books in a plastic bag against the rain. When a teacher asked for someone to sweep or carry a message, he stepped forward. He liked being trusted, and he worked to keep it.

By 2018 he was moving more between village and town, following school terms and small jobs. In town he liked the noise and the quick talk. He could speak to a motorbike rider, a shopkeeper, an older man outside a kiosk, and come away with a piece of information that mattered. He also learned how favors traveled. A man who could introduce you to a trader could also block you if you insulted him. He watched his father keep his voice level in arguments and saw how older women ended quarrels by turning talk back to what everyone needed—water, rice, a broken walkway.

COVID came in 2020. The rules changed again—handwashing, masks in certain places, schools disrupted. Ibrahim followed instructions when they were enforced and complained like everyone else when school stopped. What stayed with him was the money. Markets slowed, transport cost more, and prices climbed. A trip to town to sell produce turned into counting and recounted counting. At home his mother bought smaller amounts and stretched sauce with more leaves and less fish.

He leaned into farming as something he could manage instead of only inherit. He was not married and did not live with a woman. He spent evenings with other young men talking football and plans, but he kept his own time. He reached the field early and worked with a steady pace that made older people stop calling him a boy. When he went to town he carried small items to resell—soap, matches, sachets of seasoning—things he could pay for without borrowing. He sold quickly because he talked easily, and he kept his profit because he did not spend it on sweet drinks.

One rainy season a flood sat over the low part of a plot and spoiled seedlings. The road broke into ruts and people walked carefully with loads on their heads. Ibrahim and his brothers cut drainage channels and fought the water as long as it kept coming. The flooding turned into an argument with a neighbor about where runoff should go. Voices rose, insults started, and then older men called them under a mango tree and made them speak in turns. Lines were marked in the dirt with a stick and everyone agreed to them. Ibrahim accepted the settlement and did not reopen the fight, but after that he stopped trusting that a season would go as planned.

His improvement came by accumulation. Through kin he secured use of an extra piece of land. No papers changed hands. It was decided by talk, obligation, and witnesses. He bought a better hoe and kept it clean. He learned what town buyers wanted at different times and stopped carrying produce that would sit unsold. He still wrote with effort, but he could count, bargain, and remember what was promised.

Now, at twenty, he lives between places—sleeping in town when there is work and returning when the farm needs him. He rises before daylight, washes, and prays quickly, not to show anyone but because the day has to start. When the light comes up he shoulders a cutlass and walks the narrow path between cassava and fallow, greeting people by name. He talks as he walks. Then he steps into the field and begins, methodical, working through the tasks he set for himself the night before.
