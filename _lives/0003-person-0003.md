Ibrahim Fofana was born on September 28, 2005, in Foya Tewei, a small settlement in Moyamba District. The air stayed wet most of the year. Around the houses were low forest, old fallow, and small rice swamps fed by rain. Cassava and groundnut stood in narrow strips beside footpaths pressed hard by bare feet and bicycle tires. In the rains the track to the main road turned red and held water in its ruts. In the dry months it broke into powder that sat on skin and cloth.

He was the sixth child in a family of seven. The household was monogamous but extended, with an elderly grandmother and an older female relative who moved in and out when work or disputes shifted her. Ibrahim grew up hearing decisions made in low voices. His father spoke once and expected it done. His mother repeated the instruction and made sure it happened. Older kin corrected children without explaining.

His father farmed for food and small cash. Upland rice came first, then cassava, pepper, greens, and whatever else could survive the season. His mother worked the farm and the house without separating them. She rose before daylight, lit the fire, swept the yard, cooked, and still walked to the fields when there was planting or weeding. Their poverty showed in small refusals. The cheapest soap. Kerosene measured out to make it last. A roof sheet left loose until the next time money came.

At home Ibrahim spoke Mende fast and loud. He liked being noticed and he pushed into adult talk when he could. At the junction and in town he used Krio without hesitation. English stayed in the classroom. He could read short lines and simple notices, enough to pick out his name and understand a poster’s main point. Writing was slow and cramped. If he needed to send words, he asked someone to write them and he dictated. For quick business he used voice calls and missed calls to signal people.

The family practiced Islam. Ibrahim washed and prayed because he was told to, then because he knew the routine and didn’t want to be the one who failed it. On Fridays, if he was near the mosque, he joined the men. In Ramadan he started fasting young, broke it when hunger beat him, then tried again the next day. In the house they also kept protections that were not talked about in public: a small cloth packet tied tight and kept out of sight, a bitter wash rubbed on skin when someone complained of weakness.

Even as a boy he filled space. He greeted first and sat at the front. He remembered names, asked questions, and pushed for a reply. That openness sat beside something meaner. He watched for advantage and took it. If an older boy left a football near the path, Ibrahim picked it up and kept it until the owner came looking. If he lent a cutlass or a hoe, he demanded it back on the day he named, and if it came late he shamed the borrower in front of others. He did not seek fights for fun, but he did not step away once a dispute started.

What made adults use him was discipline. He woke at first rooster and stayed up. He moved through chores in a fixed order: water, sweep, firewood, then the farm. He washed his clothes when others waited, cleaned his sandals, and turned up when he said he would. In a place where planting late meant hunger later, people noticed.

In 2014 Ebola changed the rules around him. It came as restrictions and fear, not as a single day. Handshakes stopped. Visitors were questioned at the edge of the yard. A bucket of chlorinated water stood by doorways and everyone was forced to use it. School closed and stayed closed for months. Ibrahim hated the empty days. He tried to keep younger children working, turned chores into contests, then started trouble when he ran out of ways to control them. One afternoon he slipped away to a friend’s house after his father told him to stay. His father brought him back and beat him with a stick in the open yard. There was no lecture. The beating ended, and work continued.

When school reopened, Ibrahim went back with a hard focus. He was not a strong reader and he never became one. He did not sit quietly and disappear into a page. He did sit still when others wandered, and he worked at teachers in a way that made them answer him. He waited after class, leaned close, spoke in Krio, smiled, and kept asking until he got what he needed. Some days there were no textbooks. Some days a teacher did not come. On those days he left early and went to the farm without being told.

The 2018 election season sharpened talk in the area. In the evenings men gathered at the roadside and argued with controlled voices. Names were used carefully. Ibrahim listened and carried messages for older relatives. He learned who could reach a party man in town, who could find casual work for a boy, and who made promises only to their own people. He liked knowing things first. He repeated what he heard to the right person and watched the effect.

By fifteen he moved between the village and towns in the south, staying with relatives for stretches and returning when the farm calendar demanded him. Town gave him football on a dusty field, battery-charging stalls, and cheap music played from a phone into a small speaker. It also showed him what cash meant: rent due on a date, food bought by the plate, money asked for at every turn. He talked easily with strangers and he collected contacts. That network mattered more to him than school results.

COVID-19 reached Sierra Leone in 2020 and disrupted movement and gatherings. Ibrahim followed rules when an elder watched and ignored them when he thought he could get away with it. He did not change his habits out of fear of sickness. He changed them when money tightened. Markets slowed. Buyers came less often. When they came, they offered lower prices and demanded quick sales.

From 2021 the cost of imported goods and fuel rose hard. Transport became a calculation he made every week. He timed trips, grouped errands, and carried more than was comfortable to avoid paying twice. He started trading alongside farming, not as a dream but as a way to keep cash in hand: soap, seasoning cubes, sachet water. He bought in town, brought it back on a motorbike or in a shared vehicle, and sold near the village and at the junction.

He kept his profit separate and hidden. He also cheated when he thought he could. He used a slightly false weight. He delayed repaying small debts and told stories that made the amount sound smaller. He returned borrowed tools late and acted as if the owner was unreasonable for asking. People did not call it business skill. Older traders warned each other to watch him. Some refused him credit. When a deal failed, he blamed the other person’s greed and argued until an elder ended it.

In 2022 heavy rains flooded low points on the road and held water in a rice plot longer than it should have. Part of the crop yellowed and collapsed. Ibrahim reacted with speed and force. He pulled younger boys into the work, cut channels, cleared blocked culverts, and drove them hard with his voice. A neighbor accused him of pushing runoff toward another plot. Ibrahim argued in front of the houses where people could hear. He refused to lower his voice. An elder made them meet, drew a line in the soil, and spoke the terms out loud. Ibrahim accepted with a tight face and then went straight back to work, still angry, still moving.

By the 2023 election cycle he had become useful in two ways: labor on short notice and information that traveled between town and village. He was not married and did not live with a woman. He flirted openly and joked too much, then switched to a hard tone when someone tried to press him. He guarded his independence and his money.

He secured access to an extra piece of land through kin. He went directly to an older relative, named the share of harvest he would give, and insisted on clear terms. He planted on time, weeded early, and pushed the work until the plot looked better than others nearby. That land did not make him rich. It made him steadier. When a bad week came, he had a little reserve and more say in how the household handled it.

In 2025 he is twenty. Some nights he sleeps in town with relatives, some nights in the village, depending on planting, buyers, and who needs him. He rises early, washes, and prays by habit. Then he walks to his rice, presses his toes into the soil at the edge, checks for standing water and pests, and decides what to do first. On the path he calls greetings in Mende, then switches to Krio when he meets someone from another place. At midday he eats from a shared bowl in the shade and counts what he will carry to market. In the late afternoon he rinses mud from his legs, hangs his shirt on a line, and sits where people pass. He listens, talks, and bargains. He keeps track of favors owed and favors not returned. He plans tomorrow’s work as if someone will try to take it from him.
