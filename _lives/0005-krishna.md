Krishna was born on June 10, 1255, in the wet season, in the low country by the Brahmaputra’s shifting channels. His village sat on a slightly raised strip above the floodplain. In high water the paths turned to mud and the ponds crept outward. In the dry months the same ground cracked and the river pulled back, leaving damp sand and driftwood.

He was the third child, after two girls. Both died as infants and were spoken of as losses more than as people. The eldest sister lived. She learned the work early: husking and pounding rice, carrying water, keeping a fire going when everything was damp. Krishna grew up in a stem household. His parents shared a compound with his father’s parents, and the older generation held the store of grain and the right to decide when it could be eaten, sold, or lent.

His father worked small rice plots, some near the house and some reached by a narrow track through bamboo and betel. The harvest did not lift them above their neighbors, but it kept them out of debt in ordinary years. His mother ran the house and still went to the fields when labor was short. She moved between cooking, childcare, and seasonal work without treating them as separate jobs.

Krishna was a loud child and stayed that way. He wanted to be where people were talking. He pushed into other boys’ games, grabbed at what was being passed around, and laughed when someone protested. When he was told to watch seedlings he wandered off to the landing to see who had come by boat. When his grandmother sent him for firewood he came back with too little and a story meant to stop questions. If the story failed, he sulked, then tried again with someone else. His family learned to check what he said.

No one taught him to read. He saw palm-leaf bundles in the hands of a clerk when dues were reckoned, and he saw a Brahmin handle a stylus and recite from memory at a shrine, but Krishna only learned what could be learned by watching. In the household worship he remembered the order of things: water poured, lamp lit, flowers placed, food set out. He knew which days were kept and which names were spoken. The words mattered, but the written signs did not belong to him.

As he grew older, the river took more of his time than the fields. Rice work tied him down for long stretches and paid slowly. Fishing paid in small bursts and gave him excuses to travel between hamlets. He still worked his family’s plots when forced to, but he looked for ways out of the line. He could talk himself into joining a crew at dawn, bargain over shares, and make friends at the weekly market.

He also stole at the edges. He “forgot” to mention fish he had sold on the side. He borrowed salt and did not return it. After a good run of catch he came home with a new iron knife and said it was payment for helping a man mend a boat. His father stared at the knife and then at him. He said, flatly, that help did not buy iron. Krishna shrugged and wore it anyway.

In his late teens the rains came wrong. The first storms held back, and then the water arrived all at once. Seedlings yellowed in the nursery beds. When they were transplanted, the fields flooded and the young plants lay under silted water. The harvest was thin. Families ate smaller portions and mixed rice with whatever else they could find.

Krishna ate better than most that year because the floodplain filled with fish. He set basket traps in the shallows and pulled them up with quick, satisfied hands. He walked the forest edge for crabs and shoots and came back with leeches stuck to his calves. He brought food into the house when others brought complaints. He also used it to swagger. When his mother measured out rice with care, he threw an extra handful into his own bowl and told her there would be more tomorrow.

The shortage pushed them into debt. A better-off neighbor lent grain and expected repayment with interest in kind. Krishna carried the borrowed grain home and acted as if his charm had earned it. His mother kept count. His wife would later do the same.

The demands from the local chief’s men did not stop just because the harvest failed. This country sat near routes where armed men moved, and when trouble flared upriver, fear reached even quiet villages. With fear came orders.

One year a levy was announced on fish. The messenger came to the market with two young escorts and a clerk who carried palm leaves and a stylus. The clerk sat and scratched marks while the messenger called out household heads and what they owed. Krishna stood at the edge, listening for his father’s name, pretending he did not care.

Another year the village men were sent for corvée labor. They repaired an embankment and cut brush near a small earthwork where a watch could be kept on a main track. Krishna went because his household was named. He complained from the first mile. He worked less than the older men and vanished whenever the foreman turned away. He spent long stretches under trees with other idlers, smoking and trading stories.

When the foreman caught him and raised a hand as if to strike him, Krishna did what he always did. He spoke quickly and close. He offered a strip of dried fish and promised more after the next catch. The foreman’s anger drained into boredom. Krishna walked back to the work line with an open face and did no better than before.

He married in his twenties. His wife came into the compound and learned the habits of his mother and grandmother. She learned Krishna’s habits too. He talked big, brought home money in uneven spurts, and treated his own shortcuts as cleverness. She did not argue in public. She kept her own count of grain, salt, and fish, and she watched what he handed to others.

They had four children. Two daughters died young. Their deaths were not events that changed the world around them, but they changed the way the house sounded. After each burial the adults spoke less. The surviving children learned to stay out of the way when grief sat in the corners.

The eldest surviving child, a son, grew into a steady worker. He went to the fields when told and did not drift off to the landing. Krishna liked the boy’s strength and resented his patience. He tried to pull him into river work and market talk, into the noisy life Krishna preferred. The son listened and kept doing what he was supposed to do.

In one monsoon season, Krishna lost his gear. A squall came fast in the afternoon, turning the river gray and rough. He and two other men were out with a net near the bank where the current curled around a bend. The wind shoved the boat sideways. The net caught on something under the surface and pulled. The bamboo frame snapped and the mesh tore as they fought it.

They got to shore wet and shaken, and the net was ruined. It was not only his loss. Part of the gear belonged to a cousin, and Krishna owed him a share from every season. Now there was nothing to share.

Krishna filled the next weeks with talk. He borrowed thread and rope and promised repayment after the next good catch. He repaid a little, late, and acted irritated when asked about the rest. His wife and his mother told him to stay out of the deepest channel when the water ran hard. He nodded, smiling, and went where he wanted.

On September 28, 1298, the rains had eased but the river still ran fast. Krishna went out early with a small boat and a basket trap. He aimed for a narrow channel beside reeds where fish gathered as the floodplain began to drain. Another boat passed, larger and heavier, its hull pushing a wash across the channel. The wash met the current and rocked Krishna’s boat.

He stood to shift the trap and free it from weeds. His foot slipped on wet bamboo. He fell over the side without time to grab the gunwale. The trap’s rope caught his arm as he tried to push away. The current pulled him under and rolled him along the line.

The boat drifted. The passing boatman turned back when he saw the empty craft and the rope drawn tight into the water. He reached for the line and hauled until his hands burned. When Krishna rose, he was already dead.

They carried him home across the wet ground. In the compound his wife did not shout or faint. She looked at his face, then at the water still running off his hair, and she told the others what to do next. The river kept moving past the village, full and indifferent, as it always had.
