historical_notes:
  - "Krishna’s stated birthplace (near modern Sarupeta, Baksa; 26.57°N, 91.10°E) lies in the central Brahmaputra valley corridor historically associated with Kamarupa’s late-medieval successor polities; in the 13th century this zone was politically fragmented, with authority often exercised through local chiefs and shifting jurisdictions rather than a uniformly administered state—consistent with the narrative’s episodic levies and ad hoc corvée demands."
  - "Likely spoken language for a non-elite rural household in this area and period is an Eastern Indo-Aryan vernacular on the Kamrupi–early Assamese continuum; by contrast, high-status ritual and record-keeping were commonly mediated through prestige literacies (especially Sanskrit for liturgy and learned registers, with clerks/scribes handling written accounts), which supports the story element of dues being recorded by a clerk while Krishna remains illiterate."
  - "Regional 'frontier insecurity' in the later 1200s can be plausibly linked to Turko-Afghan/Delhi Sultanate-connected pressures advancing through Bengal and into the Brahmaputra frontier in the late 13th century (not 'Bengal Sultanate' proper); such incursions and military-posturing are a historically grounded reason local rulers could intensify exactions (extra produce levies and labor service) without implying a stable, centralized tax bureaucracy."
  - "Earthwork and water-control labor (embankment repair, ditching, track clearance) is well-attested as a mode of mobilizing rural labor in floodplain South Asia where maintaining raised ways/levees mattered for cultivation and movement; this specifically underwrites the narrative episode of compulsory embankment/track work as a realistic extraction mechanism in a riverine agrarian setting."
  - "Epistemic limits: for a 13th-century, non-elite villager in Assam, direct biographical verification (household conflicts, precise dates of minor levies, and the exact mechanics of an accidental drowning) would almost never survive in the historical record; these details should be treated as reconstruction consistent with regional patterns rather than recoverable 'personal documentation,' while higher-level anchors (place, period, polity context, language ecology) are the most defensible historical specifics."

Krishna was born on June 10, 1255, in the low country where the Brahmaputra split into channels and took land a little each year. His village sat on a raised strip above the wet flats. In the rains, paths turned to paste and ponds spread into the yards. In the dry months the same ground hardened and cracked, and the river pulled back and left sand and driftwood.

He was the third child, after two girls. Both of those sisters died before they could walk. People spoke of them as losses and kept moving. An elder sister lived and learned work early—pounding rice, carrying water, keeping a fire alive when everything was damp.

Krishna grew up in a stem household. His parents lived in one compound with his father’s parents. The older generation held the grain store and decided when it could be eaten, sold, or lent. Krishna learned early that asking did not matter as much as who controlled the basket.

His father worked small rice plots, some close to the house and some reached by a narrow track through bamboo. In ordinary years the harvest kept them fed and current on dues. His mother ran the house and still went to the fields when labor ran short. She moved between cooking, childcare, threshing, and weeding without treating them as separate tasks.

Krishna was loud as a child and stayed that way. He wanted to be where people were talking. He pushed into other boys’ games and took what was being passed around. When someone protested, he laughed and kept it a moment longer. When he was sent to watch seedlings he wandered off to the landing to see whose boat had come in. When his grandmother sent him for firewood he came back with too little and a story meant to block questions. If it failed, he sulked, then tried the same story on someone else. His family learned to check what he claimed.

No one taught him to read. He saw palm-leaf records in the hands of a clerk when dues were reckoned. He watched a Brahmin trace letters with a stylus and recite at a shrine. Krishna learned what he could by watching and repeating. In household worship he remembered the order: water poured, lamp lit, flowers placed, food set out. He knew which days were kept and which names were spoken. The written signs stayed with other people.

As he grew older, the river took more of his time than the fields. Rice work tied him down for long stretches and paid slowly. Fishing paid in small bursts and gave him reasons to move between hamlets. He still worked his family’s plots when he was forced to, but he looked for ways out of the line. He could talk himself into joining a boat crew at dawn, bargain over shares, and make himself familiar at the weekly market.

He also cheated when he thought he could get away with it. He sold fish off to the side and brought home less than he should have. He borrowed salt and let the debt sit until someone came to ask for it. After a good run of catch he came back with an iron knife and said it was payment for helping a man mend a boat. His father looked at the knife and then at him and said, flatly, that help did not buy iron. Krishna shrugged and wore it anyway. After that, his mother counted fish and grain as if Krishna were a stranger.

In his late teens the rains failed in the way that ruined crops. The first storms came late. Then the water arrived hard and fast. Seedlings yellowed in the nursery beds. When they were transplanted, fields flooded and young plants lay under silted water. The harvest came in thin.

Families stretched meals, mixing rice with whatever else they could gather. Krishna ate better than most because the floodplain filled with fish. He set basket traps in the shallows and pulled them up with quick, satisfied hands. He walked the forest edge for crabs and shoots and came back with leeches on his calves. He brought food into the house when others brought complaints. He used it to take more than his share. When his mother measured rice with care, he added an extra handful to his own bowl and told her there would be more tomorrow.

The shortage pushed them into debt. A better-off neighbor lent grain and took repayment with interest in kind. Krishna carried the borrowed grain home and acted as if his mouth and his friendships had secured it. His mother stored it and kept count anyway. She stopped trusting his reports about what he had sold.

Dues did not ease because the harvest failed. Men tied to a local lord’s following came through the market to announce extra demands. One season they added a levy on fish. The messenger stood in the open and named households. A clerk sat beside him and scratched notes into palm leaves while men argued about measures and shares. Krishna stood at the edge and listened for his father’s name, pretending he did not care, then went home angry that the household had to give up part of what he had pulled from the water.

Another year the village men were called for corvée. They repaired an embankment where floods had cut it down and cleared brush near a small earthwork set to watch a track. Krishna went because his household was named. He complained from the first mile. He worked less than the older men and drifted away whenever the overseer’s attention shifted. He spent long stretches under trees talking. When the overseer caught him and raised a hand as if to strike, Krishna stepped close and spoke fast. He offered dried fish and promised more after the next catch. The overseer took it and sent him back to the work line. Krishna did no better than before.

He married in his twenties. His wife came into the compound and learned the habits of his mother and grandmother. She learned Krishna’s habits too. He talked big, brought home money in uneven spurts, and treated his own shortcuts as cleverness. She did not correct him in front of others. She kept her own count of grain, salt, and fish, and she watched what he handed out or hid.

They had four children. One daughter died in infancy. Another lived only a year. The house went quieter after each burial. The adults spoke less for a while, then returned to work because work did not wait. A third daughter lived into her teens. Their son grew into a steady worker. He went to the fields when told and did not drift off to the landing. Krishna liked the boy’s strength and resented his steadiness. He tried to pull him into river work and market talk, into the noisy life Krishna preferred. The boy listened and kept doing what he was supposed to do.

One monsoon season Krishna lost his gear. A squall came fast in the afternoon, turning the river gray and rough. He and two other men were out with a net near the bank where the current curled around a bend. The wind shoved the boat sideways. The net snagged on something under the surface and pulled hard. The bamboo frame snapped and the mesh tore as they fought it.

They reached shore wet and shaken, and the net was ruined. Part of the gear belonged to a cousin who expected a share from every season. Now there was nothing to share. The cousin came to the compound and spoke in a flat voice while Krishna joked and blamed the river. After the cousin left, Krishna’s wife told him to stay out of the fastest water until he had proper gear again. His mother said the same. Krishna nodded and went back to the landing the next morning.

He filled the next weeks with talk and small borrowings. He took thread and rope and promised repayment after the next good catch. When people asked for what he owed, he acted insulted, as if they had misunderstood him. His father stopped backing his promises. His wife began trading in her own name when she could.

On September 28, 1298, the rains had eased but the river still ran hard. Krishna went out early with a small boat and a basket trap. He aimed for a narrow channel beside reeds where fish gathered as the floodplain began to drain.

Another boat came through the channel, larger and heavier, its hull throwing a wash across the water. The wash met the current and rocked Krishna’s craft. He stood to shift the trap and free it from weeds. His foot slipped on wet bamboo. He went over the side without a handhold.

The trap’s rope caught his arm as he tried to push away. The current took him under and rolled him along the line. The boat drifted toward the reeds.

The other boatman turned back when he saw the empty craft and the rope drawn tight into the water. He hauled on the line until his hands burned. When Krishna broke the surface, his face was slack and his chest did not move.

They carried him home across wet ground. In the compound his wife did not shout or faint. She looked at his face and at the water still running from his hair, then told the others what to do. His mother sat by the grain store and did not speak. The river kept moving past the village, full and fast, as it always had.
