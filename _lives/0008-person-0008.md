Kamla was born on 19 August 1936 in a farming village on the flat land south of Raebareli, in the United Provinces under British rule. At home the family spoke Awadhi. Their house stood on its own small plot, separate from the shared courtyards some neighbors lived in.

Her father, Ram Saran, farmed his own holding and kept two buffalo. He watched the canal schedule and the sky, and he sold milk in town. The milk money came in small, regular amounts and covered what the grain could not between harvests—salt, lamp oil, and an occasional packet of medicine.

Shanti, her mother, kept the cooking and waterwork moving and went to the fields when the season demanded it. She weeded, helped with the cut crop, and patted dung into cakes that dried for fuel. Before the day’s work she lit a lamp at the shrine niche, set down water and a few flowers, and said the morning prayers.

Kamla was the fifth child. One older sister had died before she could walk. Another girl had died at two. The son lived, and the two surviving daughters were old enough to carry water, mind the younger ones, and keep their hands busy while Shanti worked.

In late January the cold settled in. Kamla developed a cough that did not ease. Her breathing became fast and tight, then wet and noisy in her chest. Shanti kept her close to the warmth of the chulha, gave warm water, and rubbed her with oil. Ram Saran went into Raebareli and returned with a compounder’s packet. The fever climbed through it.

On 7 February 1937, before sunset, Kamla’s breathing slowed and stopped.
