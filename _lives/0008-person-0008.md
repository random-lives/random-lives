Kamla was born on 19 August 1936 in a village outside Raebareli in the United Provinces. The land around the house lay flat, cut into small fields with mango trees along the edges. At home her family spoke Awadhi.

Her parents kept a separate household, not a shared joint courtyard. They had enough land to feed themselves in a normal year and a little to sell. Her father, Ram Saran, worked the fields and kept two buffalo. He took milk to the bazaar and set the rest to curd in earthen pots to sell later. Her mother, Shanti, cooked on a clay stove and carried water. In weeding and harvest time she went out to the family plots, leaving the older girls to watch the smaller children.

Kamla was the fourth child. One sister had died in infancy and another at two. Her brother was the child neighbors asked after first. Shanti answered them and kept moving.

Each morning she lit a small lamp before the household gods and put down flowers. In October the family went to the Ramleela. In the days around Diwali, Shanti used more oil than usual and the walls held the smell of smoke.

In late January the nights turned sharp and the mornings stayed grey with fog. Kamla developed a cough and then a fever. Her breathing grew fast and wet. Shanti kept her wrapped, rubbed warmed oil on her chest, and spooned her warm water. The fever did not break.

On 7 February 1937, before midday, Kamla died in the house from an acute respiratory infection.
