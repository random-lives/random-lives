#       she uses her numeracy and conscientious routines to implement sealed storage,
#       rotating issue days, and stricter accounting during erratic monsoon conditions;
#       success improves her standing with her in-laws despite the 'married downward'

#     death_age: 33
#     death_year: -743
#     name: Jayasri
#     narrative_role: Youngest sister; lively and curious. She draws Vasundhara into
#       caretaking and household instruction, and later becomes one reason Vasundhara
#       worries about the burden younger women face when marriages shift them away from
#       natal support.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Others initially misread her as cold or proud; she compensates by
#       being reliably prepared, which gradually earns trust without social charm.
#     scene: During gatherings for guest-priests and lineage men, she stays at the edge
#       of the courtyard, speaks only when addressed, and prefers sending messages through
#       Yashoda or her mother rather than negotiating directly; she avoids singing/boasting
#       games and slips back to the storeroom to check jars.
#     timing: adolescence through married life (ages 12–24)
#     trait: Extraversion (very low, 3rd percentile)
#   - consequence: She becomes the person elders consult for practical planning, which
#       increases her authority inside the household even when her public voice remains
#       limited.
#     scene: She mentally tracks how many days grain will last under different guest
#       loads and work crews, then quietly proposes a ration schedule that aligns with
#       ritual obligations without triggering shame; she also spots inconsistencies
#       in labor claims and resolves them without confrontation.
#     timing: later childhood onward; peaks during major_achievement (ages 10–22)
#     trait: Intelligence (very high, 90th percentile)
#   - consequence: Reduces waste and conflict over stores; also makes her indispensable,
#       increasing expectations and workload.
#     scene: 'She establishes repeatable routines: marking jars, insisting on cleaning
#       and resealing after each withdrawal, and keeping a simple tally system using
#       pebbles/knots so that substitutes can follow it.'
#     timing: adolescence and adult life (ages 14–24)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (high, 67th percentile)
#   - consequence: Slower adaptation socially, but provides stability and continuity
#       during uncertainty; she changes practices only after careful observation.
#     scene: She distrusts novel remedies and prefers customary household rites and
#       proven storage methods; she resists experimenting with unfamiliar foods or new
#       rituals unless endorsed by elders.
#     timing: especially visible after marriage when encountering different household
#       customs (ages 16–20)
#     trait: Openness (low, 16th percentile)
#   - consequence: Adds strain and sleep loss, but also contributes to early detection
#       and prevention behaviors in the household.
#     scene: After the infant death in the natal household and later as her cough begins,
#       she becomes vigilant about small signs (spit, fever, child lethargy) and re-checks
#       stores at night during uncertain weather.
#     timing: childhood after sibling death and late adulthood with illness (ages 2–6
#       and 21–24)
#     trait: Neuroticism (moderately high, 59th percentile; subclinical)
# number_of_children: '0'
# number_of_siblings: '6'
# occupation: Household/estate manager (running the domestic economy, supervising labor,
#   provisioning, textiles, childcare; supporting agricultural operations)
# religion: 'Domestic Vedic household rites (gṛhya-style): regular hearth/fire offerings
#   (milk/ghee/grain), simple recitations taught in the household; life-cycle rites;
#   ancestor remembrance'

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During a year of erratic monsoon rains, she successfully organized grain
#     storage and rationing across her husband’s extended household and dependents,
#     preventing a breakdown in supplies and avoiding the need to pawn key livestock
#     or tools. Her in-laws and the household head explicitly credited her management
#     in a family council, and her procedures (sealed grain jars, rotating issue days,
#     and stricter accounting of offerings and meals) were kept afterward.
#   reasoning: For a rural woman in this era, public recognition was rare; 'achievement'
#     would mainly be informal (successful household management, alliance-making), which
#     usually left little notable distinction beyond normal expectations.

Vasundhara was born into the speech and customs of the Upper Ganga–Yamuna plains, where Indo‑Aryan farming villages and their surrounding pasture and scrub were organized by lineage heads. In her father Viramitra’s settlement, authority sat with Kshatriya households that collected dues, settled quarrels, and organized defense when rival groups pressed boundary claims. The family’s rites were domestic and regular: a clean hearth, a small fire fed with ghee, and spoken formulas learned by repetition rather than reading.

Her first memories were of being underfoot in a joint household where Viramitra’s mother Katyayani ruled the storehouse and the rhythm of the day. Katyayani insisted on predictable order. Water jars were filled before the heat rose. Grain was kept dry and sealed. The fire received its offering at the same time, with a pinch of grain and a smear of butter, and then the family ate. Vasundhara copied these sequences without being prompted. When other children ran to the yard, she stayed near the cool wall of the storeroom and watched how the lids fit on the jars.

Yashoda, four years older, pulled her into play anyway. She taught her to braid a reed cord and then teased her for braiding it too tight. Yashoda liked to talk, and she talked for both of them when adults asked questions. Vasundhara answered in short phrases and kept her eyes on the ground, but she listened to everything. When men argued in the shade about a field edge or a strip of grazing, she remembered who had spoken first and what each person had conceded.

When Vasundhara was two, her mother Soma gave birth to another daughter, Bhadri. The baby lived only a few days. Soma’s face stayed set and busy, and Katyayani added extra rinsing and extra ash around the hearth. Vasundhara learned the signs people feared—heat in the skin, the wrong smell on cloth, a cough that did not leave. After that, she never drank from a cup that had been left out uncovered, even when she was thirsty.

As the children grew, the household filled out. Rudra arrived, then Devadatta, then Satyaka, and finally Jayasri. Soma ran much of the estate’s daily work. She counted bundles of fodder, sent a man to check grazing, told women when to churn and when to dry cakes of dung for fuel, and kept the household’s dependents supplied. Vasundhara followed her without chatter. Soma set her simple tasks—counting the clay jars in the grain room, checking that the mouth coverings were tight, and tallying how much milk went to ghee. Vasundhara did them quickly and returned with exact numbers.

From age seven she carried messages inside the compound: tell Udaya the overseer that two workers were needed at the threshing floor; tell the potter’s wife that the household wanted new storage jars before the rains. She spoke softly and never added explanations. When someone pressed her to repeat a message, she repeated it word for word. Her brothers took noise and attention as proof of strength; Devadatta in particular tried to startle her by shouting from behind a post. Vasundhara flinched once, then stopped giving him the reaction. Satyaka laughed quietly and shared roasted chickpeas with her behind the cowshed, where the smell bothered them less than it bothered others.

Political obligations thickened as she moved into adolescence. Guests arrived more often: a ritual specialist connected to local patrons, Atreya, and men from allied lineages who expected meat, beer, and a place to sit while disputes were discussed. The household’s offerings grew more expensive. Soma increased the ghee set aside for ritual, and Viramitra demanded that hospitality not slip, even when the harvest ran thin. Vasundhara learned to plan meals by the day and the guest list. She disliked the courtyard when it was full. She stayed inside, where her work was clear and her voice did not have to carry.

When Vasundhara was fourteen, Katyayani died. The household shifted in ways no one announced: the younger women waited less for permission and more for Soma’s glance; Viramitra spent longer with male advisers. Vasundhara absorbed new responsibilities without seeking them. She kept a small tally system in her head and on cords—knots for jars opened, pebbles moved from one bowl to another for grain issued. When Yashoda complained that this was fussy, Vasundhara answered once, calmly, “It keeps us from arguing later,” and went back to her jars.

At sixteen, Viramitra died. The village held the rites, and Soma did not let the household fall into disorder. Still, the loss narrowed their leverage. Within a year Soma accepted a marriage arrangement for Vasundhara with Sankara, a man of a junior Kshatriya branch in a nearby village. Vasundhara listened as Yashoda explained what would happen: the move, the mother‑in‑law, the new rules. Vasundhara asked only how far the village was and whether the road crossed the river in the rains.

She married at seventeen. The transfer to Sankara’s household took one day by cart and foot, with relatives walking around her. The new house was smaller than her natal one, its storeroom less full, its dependents fewer. Dharini, her mother‑in‑law, watched her hands and her silence and seemed to take both as judgment. Vasundhara answered with work. On her second week she reorganized the grain corner without asking, then went to Dharini and described exactly what she had moved and why. Dharini scolded her for acting first. Later she used the new arrangement anyway.

Sankara was respectful and often away, pulled into duties and negotiations. When he returned he wanted clean accounts of what had been spent and what was left. Vasundhara gave him short reports: how many jars remained, how many bundles of fodder, how many men had been fed during a visit. He stopped asking her to sit with the men. Instead he sent for her when he needed an answer.

At age twenty‑one the rains broke their usual pattern. One month brought heat and wind; the next brought hard downpour. Fields sprouted unevenly. A neighboring lineage, represented by Kusika, pressed a boundary claim when the water shifted. Guests arrived to argue it, and Atreya appeared with assistants expecting provisions for rites meant to steady fortune. Krtavarman, Vasundhara’s father‑in‑law, talked of pawning a pair of strong bullocks to cover obligations.

Vasundhara prevented that. She called Nala, the older attendant woman, and Udaya the overseer, and spoke to them in the storeroom, not in the courtyard. She sealed each grain jar mouth with fresh clay and fiber so it could not be dipped from casually. She set rotating issue days, so grain was taken in measured amounts rather than by impulse. She required that every withdrawal be marked: a pebble moved, a cord knot tied, a smear of charcoal on a board that hung by the door. She adjusted meals when guests appeared, shifting from rice to barley and pulses, stretching ghee by increasing sour milk and vegetables. When men demanded more, she brought Krtavarman into the storeroom and showed him the count jar by jar.

The household passed the season without selling off its tools or livestock. In a family council Krtavarman named her plan and ordered the others to follow it. Dharini repeated the rules to the younger women, adding her own authority to them, and the procedures stayed in place after the harvest stabilized. Vasundhara took satisfaction from that. She sat at dusk on the packed earth near the back wall, ate curds with roasted grain, and listened to the soft complaints of cattle settling for the night. With Nala she traded small jokes about Udaya’s face when he realized she could outcount him.

The cough began the next year. At first it was a morning thing, then it stayed through the day. She kept working from a sitting place, sending Nala to check jars and calling instructions across the threshold. She grew thinner and tired easily, which made Dharini watch her with a different kind of attention—less suspicion, more calculation about who would do the work.

In her twenty‑fourth year a solar eclipse darkened the day. People shouted and banged pots. Atreya arrived quickly afterward, demanding extra offerings to steady the household’s fortunes. Vasundhara’s voice stayed steady as she measured out what could be spared. She could not stand for long at the hearth. Soma did not come; the villages were close, but travel and ritual obligations kept them apart.

Late in the cold season she developed fever and severe weakness on top of the cough. Dharini and Nala kept her inside, away from smoke. Sankara returned and sat near the doorway while Krtavarman spoke to Atreya about rites and obligations. Vasundhara died in the house before the next planting.

Her body was washed, wrapped, and carried out for the funerary fire. Ghee and small cakes were offered, and the household recited the words they had learned by mouth, directing her toward the ancestors.
