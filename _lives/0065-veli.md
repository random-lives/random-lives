#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: -1358
#     name: Mara
#     narrative_role: 'Mixed subsistence provider; taught trap-setting, careful tool
#       care, and boundary knowledge. Relationship: warm but demanding—praises competence,
#       scolds waste and laziness; Veli tries hard to meet his standards.'
#     role: father
#   - death_year: -1350
#     name: Neri
#     narrative_role: 'Gathering/garden tending and food processing; managed household
#       offerings and taboos. Relationship: affectionate, anxiety-tinged protectiveness
#       after infant deaths; Veli absorbs both practical skill and a nervous watchfulness.'
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: -1379
#     name: Tani
#     narrative_role: 'Primary storyteller and ritual-instruction figure for early childhood;
#       taught which groves and stones require respect. Relationship: close; she also
#       reinforced strictness about taboo breaches, shaping Veli’s conscientiousness.'
#     role: paternal grandmother (co-resident elder when Veli was born)
#   - death_year: -1342
#     name: Peru
#     narrative_role: 'A socially connected mediator who brings news from other hamlets
#       and occasional trade items; early model for Veli’s later elder role. Relationship:
#       mixed—Veli admires his knowledge but dislikes his easy charm.'
#     role: maternal uncle (frequent presence in the compound/kin-cluster)
#   children: []
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 28
#     connection: Triggered by accumulated family losses remembered in the household
#       (infant deaths) plus a run of poor seasons; Veli’s analytic temperament pushes
#       him to conclude the household’s usual offerings are misdirected and to adopt
#       a different sacred site/medium.
#     incident: religious_change
#   - age: 35
#     connection: 'Consolidation: new taboos and a new seasonal ritual schedule become
#       normal; this also becomes a point of dispute with conservative elders, highlighting
#       his low agreeableness.'
#     incident: religious_change
#   - age: 41
#     connection: Occurs during routine trapline/checking routes in steep monsoon terrain;
#       his conscientiousness (insisting on checking despite weather) contributes to
#       exposure.
#     incident: serious_accident
#   - age: 42
#     connection: Limp persists after initial healing; pushes role change—less hunting,
#       more planning/toolwork/mediation—accelerating his rise to respected elder standing.
#     incident: acquired_disability
#   - age: 62
#     connection: Wife Pori’s prolonged febrile illness; Veli’s organization skills
#       and stubborn diligence keep daily care consistent; his kin network (especially
#       Palan) becomes crucial because he cannot do all heavy tasks with a limp.
#     incident: sick_relative
#   - age: 66
#     connection: Caregiving period ends with partial stabilization; Veli’s intensified
#       offerings at the newer sacred site are credited by some kin, reinforcing his
#       earlier religious change.
#     incident: sick_relative
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6
#     key_events:
#     - Raised in an extended household with grandmother Tani as a daily presence; learns
#       early that groves/springs have rules and consequences.
#     - Younger brother Kuru dies at/near birth (age ~2); household intensifies ritual
#       caution and protective practices around Veli.
#     - Begins tagging along on short gathering trips; shows unusual memory for paths,
#       plant locations, and tool placement.
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 7-17
#     key_events:
#     - Learns trapping/hunting skills from Mara; first solo trapline responsibility
#       begins around age 12-13.
#     - Monsoon variability brings at least one lean season; Veli becomes meticulous
#       about storage, rationing, and scheduling work parties.
#     - 'Adolescent social conflicts: he is popular and talkative (high extraversion)
#       but sharp-tongued (low agreeableness), gaining both allies and grudges.'
#     phase: Later childhood / adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-40
#     key_events:
#     - Forms marriage/union with Pori around age 19; establishes an adult work routine
#       as a subsistence generalist.
#     - Gradually becomes known for planning and problem-solving (very high intelligence)
#       in hunts, pathfinding, and resource timing—while often arguing over rules and
#       fairness.
#     - Begins encountering a few exchanged bronze/metal items via kin networks; fascinated
#       by edge retention and tool design, he experiments with hafting and maintenance.
#     phase: Early adulthood
#   - age_range: 41-55
#     key_events:
#     - Serious fall on wet ridge at 41-42; weeks of incapacity; recovery changes his
#       daily role permanently.
#     - Develops lasting limp; shifts from long treks to near-camp tasks, tool repair,
#       organizing work, and dispute involvement.
#     - Elder influence grows as he leverages knowledge and planning even when physically
#       limited; younger men seek his judgment but also complain about his harshness.
#     phase: Midlife transition
#   - age_range: 56-76
#     key_events:
#     - Increasing presence of exchanged metal tools/weapons in the region; Veli becomes
#       a key evaluator/maintainer, arguing for careful stewardship rather than boasting
#       use.
#     - Primary caregiving period for Pori during prolonged febrile weakness (62-66);
#       reorganizes household labor and ritual obligations to keep her alive.
#     - 'Final decade: functions mainly as respected elder and advisor; dies of age-related
#       frailty at 76 in an elder-couple household.'
#     phase: Late adulthood / elder years

#   - name: Kilan
#     prominence: Ages 40-76
#     relationship: Younger man (next generation) who seeks Veli’s guidance but chafes
#       under his bluntness; becomes a key carrier on long trips once Veli limps
#   partners:
#   - name: Pori
#     narrative_role: 'Wife in a stable long-term union; partnership grounded in shared
#       work. Relationship quality: generally loyal and cooperative, but with recurrent

#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Improves household reliability and earns attention; also irritates
#       others because he corrects them publicly.
#     scene: As a young adult, he notices subtle seasonal cues (insect hatches, cloud
#       behavior, fruiting timing) and re-routes the group’s foraging circuit to hit
#       peak availability, then explains his reasoning step-by-step to skeptical older
#       men.
#     timing: ages 18-30
#     trait: Intelligence (96th percentile)
#   - consequence: Reputation for reliability and fairness; also builds resentment when
#       he refuses exceptions.
#     scene: He inventories cordage, traps, and stored foods, insisting on repair before
#       hunts and enforcing agreed shares with exactness.
#     timing: ages 12-76
#     trait: Conscientiousness (88th percentile)
#   - consequence: Becomes a natural organizer and later an elder voice; his visibility
#       also makes conflicts with rivals more direct.
#     scene: At communal work parties and seasonal rites he speaks often, negotiates
#       exchanges, and takes initiative in coordinating who goes where.
#     timing: ages 15-60
#     trait: Extraversion (79th percentile)
#   - consequence: Short-term escalation and hurt feelings; long-term, some respect
#       his clarity while others avoid him socially.
#     scene: During a dispute over a shared trapline boundary, he bluntly accuses a
#       cousin of lying and refuses a face-saving compromise, forcing a clear decision
#       by elders.
#     timing: ages 20-55
#     trait: Agreeableness low (27th percentile)
#   - consequence: Promotes preparedness but raises household tension; contributes to
#       his openness to a religious shift when old rituals feel ineffective.
#     scene: In lean monsoon years he becomes restless, checks stores repeatedly, and
#       interprets minor illnesses as ominous, pushing for extra precautions and offerings.
#     timing: ages 10-40 (peaks before injury); resurges during wife’s illness at 62-66
#     trait: Neuroticism high (73rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Builds trust and supports respected-elder status; contrasts with
#       others’ status-seeking and creates occasional envy.
#     scene: When a rare metal blade comes into the kin cluster, he argues it should
#       be used for community tasks and maintained carefully rather than claimed as
#       personal prestige; he returns borrowed items promptly and publicly.
#     timing: ages 35-76
#     trait: Honesty-Humility high (85th percentile)
#   - consequence: Facilitates religious change and technical adaptation; provides another
#       angle for critics to call him ‘restless’ or ‘too sure of himself’.
#     scene: He listens to a spirit-medium from a neighboring hamlet and experiments
#       with different taboos/offerings, while also trying out new hafting styles for
#       exchanged metal pieces.
#     timing: ages 25-45
#     trait: Openness moderately high (63rd percentile)
# number_of_children: '0'
# number_of_siblings: '4'
# occupation: Subsistence generalist (hunting/trapping + gathering + small-plot horticulture;
#   household provisioning)
# religion: Local animist/place-spirit and ancestor propitiation (household offerings;
#   forest/spring/rock-sacred sites; occasional animal sacrifice; communal seasonal
#   rites)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: 'Sustained period: after several deaths in his kin group and a run of poor
#     seasons, he gradually reduced everyday household offerings to one set of local
#     spirits and began instead to prioritize rites at a different nearby sacred site
#     (a spring/rock grove associated with another spirit and its medium), adopting
#     new taboos and a new pattern of seasonal propitiation.'
#   reasoning: Local animist/ancestor practices tend to be stable across life; significant
#     conversion or rupture is less common in isolated non-state communities, though
#     personal shifts in practice can happen.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 28-35
#   type: religious_change
# - event: 'Single event: while moving on a steep, rain-slick ridge to check traps and
#     gather forest products, he fell several body-lengths onto rocks/roots and was
#     carried back to camp, unable to work for many weeks.'
#   reasoning: As a lifelong subsistence generalist in steep, wet montane forest, he
#     faced frequent risks from falls, tree/cliff terrain, tool injuries, and animal
#     encounters; over 76 years, a serious accident is fairly likely.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 41-42
#   type: serious_accident
# - event: 'Sustained period: following the fall, he never fully recovered strength
#     and range of motion in one leg/hip, developing a lasting limp that limited long
#     treks and steep climbs, shifting him toward lighter gathering, tool-making, and
#     elder decision roles.'
#   reasoning: Old age in a premodern setting commonly brings vision/hearing decline
#     and mobility impairment, and injuries/infections can worsen this; surviving with
#     it long enough to matter is moderately likely.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 42-76
#   type: acquired_disability
# - event: 'Sustained period: he provided prolonged daily care for his wife during a
#     long decline marked by recurrent fever and weakness—preparing food, fetching water
#     and fuel, organizing herbal treatments and offerings, and coordinating help from
#     nearby kin until she partially stabilized.'
#   reasoning: An elder couple household and his respected-elder role fit prolonged
#     care for an ill spouse or close kin, especially without own children to delegate
#     care to.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 62-66

Veli was born into a small Dravidian-speaking forest community in the high, wet ridges east of the coastal plain, where families kept garden plots in clearings and depended on traplines, gathered foods, and the animals of the hill forest. No distant ruler collected dues from his hamlet. Decisions sat with elders and with the pull of family. People measured security in stored tubers, cordage, and the steadiness of the monsoon, and they treated certain rocks, springs, and groves as places that listened.

His father Mara carried a bow and a set of traps made from bent saplings and twisted fiber. His mother Neri kept the hearth, tended small patches of plants near the dwelling, and dried sliced roots on racks where smoke could reach them. When Veli was born, his grandmother Tani lived close enough to hear a baby cry and arrive with water, leaves for wiping, and a sharp opinion about what had been done wrong. An older sister, Celi, was already a name used in the household, but she died when Veli was an infant, and her small keepsake bundle—cord, a bead, a scrap of bark cloth—stayed in a corner where children were told not to touch. Before Veli could talk, there had been another birth, a boy named Kari, who died at birth. The adults spoke about it without ceremony.

Veli grew as a smaller boy, narrow and wiry. He watched closely. He remembered where every tool was put and complained when someone left a blade in damp leaves. He learned the household’s rules early: do not spit into the spring pool; do not carry bloodied meat past the standing stone without setting down a pinch of food; do not eat certain forest fruits before the first thunder of the season. Neri made small offerings at the hearth—cooked grains when there were grains, mashed roots when there were roots—and Tani tied bits of fiber to a branch at the edge of the grove that faced the ridge.

When Veli was two, Neri gave birth again. The baby, Kuru, did not live. Two years later another boy, Palan, was born and survived. After that, Tani watched Veli closely. She kept him near her while she scraped tubers and told him the names of ridges and the names of illnesses. Mara began bringing him on short trips, not to hunt at first, but to learn the paths without asking for a hand. By twelve Veli was checking simple traps set close to camp. He came back with small game and a list of what he had seen: fresh scat, broken branches, a stranger’s footmarks pressed into mud. He could speak about such things in detail until everyone was tired of listening.

Monsoon years did not stay steady. When Veli was thirteen, rains came hard and then stopped early. Roots shrank in the ground and the river dropped. The household rationed; Mara snapped at anyone who ate outside the shared meals. Veli began counting bundles of dried food, tying them in groups of equal size. His younger brother Palan, then ten, teased him for it and tried to steal one bundle just to see Veli’s face. Veli chased him, grabbed him by the shoulder, and shoved him into the mud. Then he made Palan re-tie every bundle under his gaze. Palan laughed about it later, but he stopped taking Veli’s things.

At nineteen, Veli entered a long union with a woman named Pori from a nearby hamlet. They set up as a couple within the broader cluster of relatives. Pori worked steadily, gathered and planted without complaint, and she had a short way of speaking when she was tired. Their life had no children’s cries. Month after month passed, then year after year, with no birth that lived. Older women watched Pori’s belly and exchanged quiet comments. Veli argued once with an aunt who suggested his line had been offended by some neglected ancestor. He answered too sharply and had to be pulled away by Mara.

Veli’s strength as a young adult lay in planning. He listened to older men talk about fruiting trees and animal trails, then laid out a circuit that struck each place at the right time. He watched insects and cloud edges and the smell of the wind, and he insisted on leaving earlier than others wanted. He liked a thin gruel made from pounded roots and souring water, especially at first light. He sat on a flat stone above the spring while he ate it, facing the ridge line. When troubled, he went there alone and sorted cordage with his hands, twisting and untwisting until his thoughts slowed.

His bluntness made friction. A hunter named Kota from a nearby hamlet sometimes worked alongside Veli, and they could talk for an hour about trap mechanics and then ruin the day by arguing about a boundary. Veli accused Kota of lying over a trapline placement. Kota responded with insults and a shove. Elders settled it, but the grudge stayed. Even so, when a large boar was brought down later that season, Kota and Veli carved and salted the meat together, exchanging terse jokes over whose cut was cleaner.

Tani died when Veli was twenty-nine, and Mara followed when Veli was fifty. Neri outlived her husband by eight years before she too was gone. After another run of poor seasons and several deaths among close family, Veli changed the way he dealt with the unseen. He stopped placing everyday offerings at the old hearth place his mother favored and began taking them instead to a different sacred site: a spring spilling from a rock face near a small grove. The medium there, a man named Teyan, kept certain taboos and carried a bundle of stones that he used for divination. Veli adopted the taboos with strictness—no meat on certain days, no entry to the grove after a particular bird call—and he redirected communal seasonal propitiation toward that spring. Some elders called it stubbornness. Veli answered them directly, listing what had happened in the years of the old offerings. The disputes were loud. By thirty-five the new pattern held in his household, and some younger men followed his lead when they wanted to show seriousness.

In his late thirties, a few pieces of traded metal reached the hills more often. A bronze blade came through a relative who had met people closer to the coast. Veli did not wear it for display. He kept it oiled, wrapped, and dry, and he argued it should be used for shared tasks, not for swagger. A tool-maker named Vannan showed him new ways to haft and bind. Veli learned quickly, taking the binding apart and redoing it until it sat exactly right.

At forty-one, in a wet season when the ridge paths were slick, Veli insisted on checking a trapline himself. He climbed despite warnings and moved along a steep slope. His foot slid. He fell several body-lengths, struck roots and stone, and landed hard. Men carried him back on a rough stretcher of poles. For weeks he could not put weight through one leg. Pori fed him and washed him and snapped at him when he tried to stand too soon. When he finally rose, the leg never moved the same. A limp stayed with him for the rest of his life. He gave up long treks and steep climbs. He took up near-camp tasks with intensity: repairing traps, shaping shafts, mending baskets, and assigning work parties with sharp, exact directions.

The limp pushed him into the center of decisions. Younger men came to ask what route to take, who to send, how much to store. Veli listened and answered without softness. His brother Palan, now an adult, became his closest companion. They argued often, especially when Palan wanted to take risks for quick gain, but Palan also carried Veli’s messages and enforced his schedules.

When Veli was sixty-two, Pori fell into a long illness of recurrent fever and weakness. She could not walk far and often could not keep food down. Veli became her daily caretaker. He prepared thin food, fetched water and fuel, and asked relatives for help with heavy work he could not do well with his bad leg. He organized herbal treatments and brought offerings to the spring-rock grove, keeping the taboos tightly. Palan took over long trips and returned with medicine plants and salt traded from lower country. Teyan visited and performed rites at the grove, and Veli kept the household quiet when Pori slept. By sixty-six she stabilized enough to move about the compound, though she never returned to her earlier strength.

In his seventies Veli spoke less during work and more during disputes. He still sat at first light with his sour gruel and watched the ridge line. He scolded carelessness with tools, then laughed once, briefly, when Palan mocked his precise knots by tying an exaggerated tangle and asking if it satisfied him. Veli retied it properly, then handed it back without comment.
