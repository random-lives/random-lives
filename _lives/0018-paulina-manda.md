Paulina Manda was born on December 1, 1975, in the miombo country above Lake Nyasa. At night the temperature dropped enough that a child slept pulled tight under a cloth. Her family’s compound sat on a rise around eleven hundred meters, reached by dirt tracks that turned slick in the rains. Around the houses were maize and beans, a few vegetable beds, trees left standing for poles and firewood, and open grazing where the cattle moved slowly in the heat.

Her father owned enough land and animals to hire labor at planting and harvest. When other households ran short before the next crop, he lent out grain and expected it returned. Her mother worked the everyday center of the place—hoeing, carrying water, pounding grain, cooking, washing, and keeping children in line with a quick word and a look that stopped arguments.

Paulina was the second child. She had an older sister, then two brothers and three more sisters. One of the younger girls died as an infant. The women spoke of it without ceremony because talking carefully did not change anything. A widowed grandmother lived with them and took a quiet interest in everything: which child had taken extra salt, who had slipped away to meet friends, whose goats had wandered into someone’s cassava.

At home Paulina spoke Kimanda. At school she used Kiswahili. She started with chalk and slate, then moved to exercise books with torn covers. She wrote neatly and kept her pages clean. Teachers relied on her to read aloud and carry messages because she did what she was told and did not try to entertain anyone. When she was corrected in front of others, the heat rose in her face and stayed there long after the lesson ended. She did not fight back. She stored the mistake and turned it over in her mind at night.

When she was small, village life still carried the routines of ujamaa: meetings, communal work days, instructions that came down through local officials. By the time she was a teenager in the late 1980s, that order had thinned. Fertilizer and other inputs became harder to get through official channels. Prices moved without warning. People argued about cash, about private buyers, about whether it was worth carrying produce farther to reach a better market. Paulina listened to adults talk and remembered what they paid last season. She was quick with numbers and slow to trust promises.

She was a churchgoer on major days and for funerals. She knew the hymns and the right greetings, but she did not build her week around religion. She relied on things she could check: a sack’s weight, the look of a crop, the direction of the wind before rain.

HIV/AIDS arrived in her area as a change in the rhythm of life. Funerals came closer together. Households rearranged themselves when a sick adult could not work, when children were sent to an aunt, when an older woman took on a baby again. Health workers brought talks to the village and put posters up in trading centers. Paulina watched who grew thin and who disappeared from public view. She did not repeat stories. When a neighbor needed help because someone at home was weak, Paulina came with her hoe and worked without chatting about reasons. She also noticed who used sickness as an excuse to avoid responsibility, and she never forgot it.

As a young woman she married and moved within the district. The trees and the air were the same, but she had to learn new water paths and the order of stalls at a different market. She had two children, a girl and then a boy. She kept their clinic cards dry in plastic and saved coins in a tin for exercise books and soap. At home she was not soft. She did not shout often, but when she did the children froze and listened.

Her marriage ended without one clean break. It wore down through money arguments and small, repeated embarrassments. Her husband wanted to be treated as the one in charge, but he left the planning and the worry on her. Paulina disliked open conflict and carried it badly—tight jaw, quiet voice, long silences that made other people uncomfortable. She still refused to be pushed into a corner. When she separated, she left with her children, her clothes, and a few household items. She went back to her natal network, where her father’s name and her own record still counted. People watched to see if she would fail on her own. She did not give them that.

She became a farmer-trader in a way everyone could see. She grew maize and beans and kept a small vegetable plot for quick cash. On market days she carried sacks and bundles, sometimes paying for a bicycle to take a load, sometimes getting space on a passing truck. She learned what moved fast and what trapped money. She sold soap in single bars, cooking oil measured into small containers, and dried fish brought up from the lake. She wrote lists in Kiswahili and marked debts clearly. When someone tried to blur a debt with jokes and friendliness, she did not smile. She waited until the person named a date and an amount.

In 1997 and 1998 the El Niño rains hit hard. Paths turned to clay and a culvert on her route to a larger trading center washed out. Trucks stopped coming for weeks. Grain stored in the house took damp at the edges. In the evenings Paulina spread cobs out and turned them by hand, saving what she could. Prices jumped and people with cash circled, looking to buy cheap from households that had to sell. Paulina sold almost nothing. She ate more from her stores and guarded her seed. It made that year tighter than it had to be, but she entered the next season without begging.

In the 2000s mobile phones began to show up in the trading center. At first they belonged to salaried men and bigger traders. Later women who sold tomatoes had them too, wrapped in plastic against dust. Paulina saved for months and bought a basic handset. She charged it at a kiosk and learned to send and receive money through the phone when the service reached her area. It changed how she worked. She could call ahead to check prices and confirm deliveries. She could receive small transfers without losing a day on the road. She also became harder to cheat because she could verify things.

In the 2010s a pest outbreak tore through maize in her area. Leaves shredded and cobs formed badly. Paulina lost enough that she could not rely on harvest sales that season. She shifted into goods that did not depend on her own field: secondhand clothes brought from a larger town, salt, and small packets of biscuits for schoolchildren. She borrowed money from a relative and wrote the terms down in Kiswahili herself. She repaid on time, not because it made her proud, but because she could not stand the thought of being discussed as a woman who ate other people’s money.

Her worst public day came over a sack of beans. A buyer accused her of shorting weight. People gathered quickly, ready for entertainment. Paulina went still. Her face burned and her stomach tightened, but her voice stayed level. She told the market chairperson to bring the hanging scale and the standard weights and to weigh the sack again in front of everyone. The needle settled close to her figure. The chairperson told the buyer to pay and stop causing trouble. The buyer paid, angry. Paulina did not argue further or smile. She folded the money, tied it into her cloth, and walked away. That night she lay awake replaying the scene until her chest hurt with it.

By her late forties she was a familiar figure in the local trading center. She was not a politician and not a church leader, but she carried the standing of her birth family and kept it with steady conduct. When people collected contributions to repair a well or buy materials for the school, they expected her to give and she did. She watched who contributed and who made speeches instead. Her son teased her for caring what others thought. She answered him in Kiswahili, sharp and controlled, that respect was how you kept help available when you needed it.

On an ordinary morning she wakes before sunrise when the air is cool on her arms. She steps outside and listens for rain. She lights the fire, stirs porridge, and checks her phone for messages about today’s market. Her grown daughter has sent a short note and a small transfer. Paulina counts it twice, writes it down on a page kept inside a plastic cover, ties her headscarf, and walks toward the fields, going over the day’s costs and prices in her mind until they sit in order.
