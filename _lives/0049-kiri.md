# Debug information (not displayed on page):
# Age at death: 0
# Birth date: June 2, 168147 BC
# Birth year: 168147 BC
# Climate now: Today the Nile Delta is warm-temperate to semi-arid with mild wet winters
#   and hot dry summers, heavily modified by agriculture and dams. The coastline sits
#   farther inland relative to glacial lowstands, with extensive urbanization and managed
#   canals replacing much of the natural marsh mosaic.
# Climate then: Around 168,000 years ago North Africa was in a generally cooler, drier
#   glacial phase, so deserts expanded and vegetation outside the river corridor was
#   sparse. Even so, the Nile Delta fringe would remain a relative refugium because
#   river discharge sustained wetlands and shallow lakes, though the coastline lay farther
#   north due to lower sea levels, making the delta edge more terrestrial and braided
#   than today.
# Cultural tradition: undifferentiated
# Death date: November 1, 168147 BC
# Environment: A low-lying mosaic of river channels, levees, marshes, and brackish lagoons
#   at the Nile’s mouth, with broad mudflats and reedbeds grading into drier steppe
#   and sandy ridges inland. Food and raw materials would center on fish, waterfowl,
#   small game, edible wetland plants, and stone gathered from nearby desert margins
#   or brought along the river.

Kiri was born first among five children in a band that moved along the Nile Delta fringe, camping on sandy ridges above reedbeds and brackish lagoons. No chiefs governed them. Decisions were argued out among adult kin, and the band kept ties with other river groups through visits and marriage exchange. They handled sickness and luck through acts directed to the band’s dead: small offerings set on the ground at the edge of camp, with a pinch of fish fat or a few crushed seeds.

Her mother, Sena, gave birth at the start of the cooler season. The women set a screen of woven reeds for privacy, and Mara, Sena’s mother, stayed close with water carried in a skin and a bundle of clean plant fiber for wiping. Kora brought back duck and fish from the channels and kept a small fire burning through the night so the infant stayed warm when the wind came off the lagoons.

Kiri fed often. Sena carried her against her chest when the camp shifted to higher ground after a rise in water. A few weeks later Kiri’s stools turned watery and frequent. Sena nursed her continuously and dabbed her mouth with damp fiber. Dasa, an older man who spoke for the dead, rubbed fish oil on the infant’s belly and set a strip of reed mat with a morsel of dried fish at the camp margin.

On a cold night in her fifth month, Kiri died in Sena’s arms. At dawn Kora and Sena dug into a dry ridge above the marsh, laid her wrapped in soft hide, and pressed a small tuft of reed down beside her before covering the grave with sand and shells.
