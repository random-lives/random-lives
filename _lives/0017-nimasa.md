#   reasoning: Her intermittent residence with a male partner and his kin makes intimate-partner/household
#     violence one of the most common pathways to recorded victimization, and her impairment

#   reasoning: Non-domestic fights/assaults (conflict with other band members, disputes
#     during aggregation/fission, inter-group encounters) were real risks but typically
#     less frequent than partner/household violence for young women.

#     wound but not killing them.
#   reasoning: The most likely form of perpetration is nonlethal physical assault during
#     disputes within camp/kin networks; severe mental disorder and low conscientiousness
#     can increase impulsive or reactive violence despite generally prosocial traits.

Nimasa was born in early autumn beside the creeks and hardwood ridges of what is now middle Tennessee. No chiefs ruled there. A handful of families moved together, splitting and gathering by season, tied by marriage and obligation. Her people spoke an old form of a Muskogean tongue, and they traveled the rivers because fish fed them when the woods went quiet.

Her father, Seko, made his name on water. He cut poles for weirs and watched eddies for the flash of fish. He kept cordage coiled and dry, and he mended nets with steady fingers. When the camp moved, he carried the heavy things without talk. Nimasa’s mother, Hali, did everything that filled the gaps: digging roots, lifting stones for crayfish, wading for mussels, cutting bark for cord, and keeping fire alive through rain.

Nimasa entered a crowded home. Three brothers came before her. The first died at birth and was carried away before the leaves changed. The second, Kowa, grew into a hard-bodied man who laughed easily and threw stones well. The third, Teno, survived and grew taller than the others. After Nimasa came a sister, Sali, who lived long enough to nurse and then died in the cold season when coughs moved through the shelters. Hali’s arms stayed strong, but her face changed after that. She spoke less. She kept Nimasa close on long walks.

As a small child Nimasa wandered farther than anyone wanted. She took sudden turns off the path to pick bright berries or to follow a beetle in leaf litter. When Hali sent her to bring water, Nimasa came back with a clay-smeared stone she wanted to keep, or with nothing because she had watched a snake slide between roots. Kowa teased her and called her “wide eyes.” She liked it and repeated the words, laughing too loud for a child in a tight camp.

Nimasa learned the river early. She stood on the mud bank and watched her father and uncles tighten a weir. She liked the sound of fish in a basket and the sharp clean work of scraping scales. When the women waded for mussels, she followed Hali, feeling with her toes in the silt. She filled her own small basket with shells and liked the weight of it against her hip. At night she sat close to the fire and cracked roasted hickory nuts between two stones. She ate the pieces slowly and hid the best ones in her palm before giving them to her younger cousins, then laughed when they begged for more.

When Nimasa was still young, her band broke apart and joined another. A quarrel over hunting rights and old injuries pushed some families to leave, and Seko chose to go. They moved west and north along the bigger waters, living for stretches near broad bends where fish ran thick in warm months. New shelters rose beside old fire scars left by other people. Nimasa watched unfamiliar women split cane and braid cordage in patterns she did not know. She listened closely to their words and copied them wrong, then tried again, pleased by the sound even when she failed.

As Nimasa grew into her teens, her days centered on the river. She carried baskets of mussels to the cooking fire and fed sticks under the pots. She cut fish open with a flake and rinsed the guts in the current. She helped lay thin strips on racks above a low smoky fire, then forgot and let some pieces burn. Hali corrected her, sharp and quick. Nimasa scowled and walked down to the water, sitting on a flat stone where the current pressed against a log. That was her place when she wanted quiet. She watched the surface for long stretches, hands idle, eyes fixed, then sudden motion as she scooped a small fish with both hands and shrieked with laughter when it slipped away.

She formed a friendship with a girl named Kimi from the joined group. Kimi liked to talk and liked Nimasa’s blunt jokes. They sat together while older women scraped hides and told stories. Nimasa interrupted too much and got snapped at; Kimi nudged her knee and made her stop. When Nimasa did her work well—cleaning fish fast, keeping the fire even—Kimi grinned and tapped her shoulder in approval. Nimasa took that praise hard. She sought it.

At fifteen, during a large gathering near a shellfish bed, Nimasa fought. The mussels lay thick and everyone wanted the easiest spots. Another young woman, Rina, shoved Nimasa’s basket aside and stepped into the shallows in front of her. Nimasa grabbed the basket back and cursed. Rina grabbed Nimasa’s hair, yanked her down, and hit her with a hard branch. Nimasa flailed and clawed, then crawled out with mud on her face and a welt along her arm. Hali washed her in the river, hands rough, saying nothing. Kimi sat close afterward and picked leaves from Nimasa’s hair while Nimasa stared at the water and shook.

By sixteen Nimasa began sleeping some nights in the shelter of a young fisherman named Yano. He was not her husband; he never made a public exchange or a promise that held. His mother tolerated Nimasa because Seko’s fish and Hali’s gathered food filled the shared racks. Nimasa liked the feel of Yano’s warm body in a cold wind, and she liked that he told jokes quietly when others slept. She laughed with her face buried in her arm so nobody would hear.

During a warm-season fish run, Nimasa stayed with Yano’s kin at a riverside camp. After a communal meal, when smoke drifted low and people settled into sleep, a male relative of Yano’s forced sex on her. He held her down and told her he would say she tried to pull him to her if she spoke. Nimasa left the shelter before dawn and sat on her flat stone by the water, knees drawn up. When Kimi found her, Nimasa snapped at her and told her to go away. Later that day she worked fast at the fish racks, jaw tight, hands shaking when someone came too close.

After that, Nimasa’s temper shortened. She flared during food disputes. She missed tasks and wandered off when she was supposed to be watching smoking racks. People corrected her more. Some laughed. Some watched her carefully. She still returned to the river work, because it was what she could do without thinking, and because the current gave her something to stare at when her mind ran hard.

At seventeen or eighteen, a tense dispute broke out over food distribution after a poor catch. Someone reached into a basket that Nimasa had helped fill. Words became shoves. Nimasa grabbed a stone or heavy piece of wood and struck, opening a bleeding head wound on another person. The injured person did not die. Elders pulled Nimasa back, shouting her name. Seko stepped between her and the others, arms out, face hard. Nimasa stood panting and then began to cry, loud and ragged, as if surprised by the sound coming from her.

Not long after, Nimasa argued with Yano over her share of dried fish and where she would sleep. He struck her and kicked her in front of others. Her lip split and her cheek swelled. Two older men dragged him back by the shoulders and yelled until he sat down. Nimasa stayed on her feet, wiping blood with the back of her hand, eyes fixed on the racks as if counting every strip.

She carried a child the next season and gave birth to a daughter, Asa. Nimasa held the infant close and hummed the same short tune while she walked, a tune Hali used to quiet babies. Asa lived a year. Nimasa fed her mashed nuts and bits of fish, kept her wrapped on cold nights, and snapped at anyone who tried to take her from her arms. The child died during a time of cough and loose stools moving through the camp. Nimasa sat beside the small body until Hali took the child and carried her away.

In the following cold season, Nimasa caught an acute infection. It began with a hard cough and fever, and then she could not keep water down. Hali tried to drip water into her mouth with a reed. Kimi held Nimasa’s shoulders when she shook. Seko brought hot stones wrapped in hide to place at her feet. Nimasa pushed them away in irritation, then begged for them back when chills hit. On the day she died, she vomited again and could not stand. Her breathing turned fast and shallow, and then stopped while Hali held her head and Kimi pressed her palm against Nimasa’s forearm to keep her still. Nimasa was nineteen.
