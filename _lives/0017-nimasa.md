#     leaving bruises and a swollen lip before elders pulled him away.
#   reasoning: Her intermittent residence with a male partner and his kin makes intimate-partner/household
#     violence one of the most common pathways to recorded victimization, and her impairment
#     could increase dependence and vulnerability.

#     hair, thrown down, and hit with a stick or hard branch.
#   reasoning: Non-domestic fights/assaults (conflict with other band members, disputes
#     during aggregation/fission, inter-group encounters) were real risks but typically
#     less frequent than partner/household violence for young women.
#   tier: 2

# - event: In a tense dispute at camp, she hit another person with a stone or heavy
#     piece of wood during a scuffle over food distribution, causing a bleeding head
#     wound but not killing them.
#   reasoning: The most likely form of perpetration is nonlethal physical assault during
#     disputes within camp/kin networks; severe mental disorder and low conscientiousness
#     can increase impulsive or reactive violence despite generally prosocial traits.

Nimasa was born when her mother came back from the river with wet baskets of mussels and her father dragged a fish trap up onto the gravel bar to mend it. The land was thick hardwood forest and cane breaks along the watercourses, with ridges that held deer and smaller game. No chiefs ruled it. A camp listened to the older men and women who could settle disputes, and a band stayed alive by keeping ties with other bands that spoke related tongues. Nimasa’s people spoke an old form of what would later become Muskogean speech, and they moved with the seasons.

Her father, Toke, was a river worker. He shaped stakes and set weirs in shallows when the water was low, and he checked traps at first light. He carried a bone point and a net bundle that smelled of fish oil. Her mother, Sali, did everything—gathered nuts and greens, hauled firewood, dug roots, watched children, and packed the camp when it was time to move.

Nimasa came after three boys and one girl. The oldest boy, Kena, never left her mother’s arms; he died the day he was born. A second brother, Noka, grew up strong and loud, and a third, Tala, followed him. The sister, Asha, was born between the boys and Nimasa. Asha also died the day she was born. Nimasa learned those facts as part of the household’s talk, not as a story told once. The dead infants stayed present in what her mother said about birth and the care of newborns.

When Nimasa was small, the family moved in a wider loop than before. A band split after a quarrel over hunting grounds and the use of a riverside campsite, and Nimasa’s parents went with the group that followed the water south and west for a time, then back east into another drainage. They slept under bark and hide shelters, then under lean-tos of poles and mats, depending on season and how long they meant to stay. In cold months they favored protected hollows and the lee of ridges. In warm months they came down to the river and stayed close to fish and shellfish.

Nimasa did not sit still. She wandered away from where the other children were told to stay, following a beetle or a bird call, or picking up stones and dropping them again. When adults spoke to her, she answered too quickly or not at all. She forgot tasks that had just been given. She lost tools and came back with empty hands. Some days she stared at the ground and whispered to herself as if someone stood close to her ear. Other days she laughed at nothing and walked into the water up to her thighs with her clothing on, then came out and stood shivering until her mother grabbed her.

Her family did not cast her out. Sali kept her close during camp moves, tying a cord around Nimasa’s wrist when the group had to cross rocky shallows. Toke scolded her, then softened and handed her the easy work: carrying light bundles, fetching bark, stripping fish with a dull scraper while someone watched.

By her early teens, Nimasa worked the river edges. She waded in the shallows, feeling with her toes for shells. She pried mussels from the mud and stacked them in a basket. She brought them to the hearth where older women opened them with stone blades and roasted them on coals. She helped scrape fish, spread strips on racks, and turn them so they dried. The camp smelled of smoke and fat.

At fifteen, during a large gathering by the river when several families camped within calling distance, Nimasa fought another young woman over a shellfish bed. The other girl stepped into the patch Nimasa had been working and began filling her own basket. Nimasa shouted and shoved her. The girl seized Nimasa’s hair, yanked her down into wet sand, and struck her with a hard branch. Nimasa came up with grit in her mouth and a split lip. An older woman pulled them apart and made them sit on opposite sides of the fire until the anger cooled.

The next year the camp stayed longer at the river for a strong fish run. A young man named Tok showed up with his mother’s kin from another stretch of water. He slept near Nimasa’s family and brought fish to Toke as a gift. Tok began to expect Nimasa at his side when the group moved between fishing places. Nimasa sometimes stayed at his kin’s shelter, then drifted back to her parents when she felt crowded or when she had one of her restless nights.

During that same season, after a communal meal when the fish had been shared and the coals were banked, Tok’s mother’s brother came into the shelter where Nimasa lay. He pressed his weight onto her and forced sex on her. He told her that if she cried out he would say she had tried to seduce him and start trouble between families. Nimasa did not sleep afterward. She walked out before daylight and stood by the water until her skin numbed. She did not tell her father. She told Sali in a rush of words and then refused to repeat it. Sali watched that man more closely after that and kept Nimasa nearer to her own sleeping place when possible.

By seventeen, Nimasa’s belly began to swell. Tok did not speak of any formal joining, and he did not move fully into her parents’ shelter. Nimasa kept working until late in the pregnancy, then stayed nearer the fires. The birth was hard. Sali and another woman held her shoulders and legs. The baby came alive, a girl. Nimasa held her and then pushed her away, then pulled her back. She named the child Sena.

Sena lived through one winter. Nimasa carried her on her hip when she remembered and left her lying too close to the fire when she did not. Sali corrected her. Tok brought food sometimes and stayed some nights, then left with his kin for stretches. When Sena became sick with coughing and loose stools, Nimasa could not follow the instructions she was given. She brought water when told to keep the child warm. She fed thin broth when told to withhold it. Sena died before the next warm season.

After Sena’s death, Nimasa stayed more often with Tok’s kin, not because the shelter felt like home but because she did not want to listen to her mother’s quiet work and the soft talk around the hearth. In that camp, food sharing caused tension. During a distribution of dried fish, Nimasa grabbed more than her share. Someone protested. Nimasa swung a heavy piece of wood and struck a person in the head, opening the scalp. Blood ran down the face and onto the sand. Men rushed in. Nimasa stood rigid, then began shouting at someone no one else could see. Elders kept the injured person’s family from attacking her. Her father offered fish and a good stone blade in compensation.

At eighteen, another quarrel with Tok turned into a beating. Nimasa argued about where she would sleep and demanded a larger portion of dried fish. Tok hit her with his hand, then kicked her when she fell, in front of others. She crawled away with bruises on her ribs and a swollen lip. Two older men hauled Tok back by the shoulders and spoke to him in sharp, low voices. Nimasa stayed near Tok’s mother for several days after that, quiet and watchful.

In her nineteenth year, late in the season when cold nights returned, Nimasa fell ill. She began with a cough and watery diarrhea. She could not keep down food. Her mouth dried and cracked. Sali tried to give her warm liquid and small bites of mashed nut meal. Nimasa pushed it away, then begged for water and vomited it. Her skin went cold and clammy, and she shook even when blankets and hides were piled on her.

On the day she died, the camp had moved to a more sheltered place off the river, among hardwoods where leaf litter stayed dry. Nimasa lay near the fire and tried to stand once, then collapsed. Her breathing became fast and shallow, and she soiled herself. Sali held her shoulders while another woman wiped her and kept the fire close. Nimasa thrashed and struck at hands that tried to help. By nightfall she stopped responding to voices and lay still. She died there, nineteen years old, in November of 1948 BC.
