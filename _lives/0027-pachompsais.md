#     death_year: -20
#     name: Tasenouphis
#     narrative_role: Only child, dies shortly after birth; becomes a quiet absence
#       in the household. The loss reduces future security in old age and intensifies
#       the couple’s reliance on siblings/affines for mutual support.
#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 20
#     connection: Occurs during early steady employment as a hired field hand; leads

#     incident: premarital_sex
#   - age: 30
#     connection: Clusters after household formation and entry into a joint household
#       economy; loss of tools/food increases dependence on borrowing and small patronage
#       ties, feeding into later debt vulnerability.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 35
#     connection: Triggered by poor inundation and irregular hiring; exacerbated by
#       earlier theft losses and lack of surviving children as an economic buffer; pushes
#       him into more dangerous heavy labor (levee/canal work), setting conditions for
#       later risk-taking at work.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-7
#     key_events:
#     - Born in a Nile Delta village household already marked by the earlier infant
#       death of an older brother.
#     - Father dies around age 5; household shifts to mother’s fish/reed processing
#       and piecemeal help from kin.
#     - 'Begins learning strict routines: water carrying, watching bundles, simple tasks
#       tied to wetland work and gleaning.'
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 8-17
#     key_events:
#     - Works increasingly as a helper in fields and canals; becomes known as dependable
#       and quiet rather than bold.
#     - Roman annexation and administrative tightening (around age 12–15) felt through
#       more insistent tax collection and labor demands in the district.
#     - Learns to avoid disputes, defer to elders, and follow customary practice; develops
#       a reputation for fairness in small exchanges.
#     phase: Later childhood and adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-27
#     key_events:
#     - Becomes a regular hired hand for seasonal fieldwork and canal/levee labor; often
#       attached to a work gang.
#     - Courtship with Tachonsis; premarital sex leads to family pressure for a recognized
#       union (marriage around -23).
#     - Birth of daughter Tasenouphis and her death in infancy (-20), followed by a
#       return to work-focused routine and quiet grief.
#     phase: Young adulthood
#   - age_range: 28-41
#     key_events:
#     - Lives in or transitions into a joint household arrangement with another married
#       couple (most plausibly involving his sister or his wife’s sibling), pooling
#       food and labor.
#     - Experiences recurring petty thefts of tools/food stores during peak working
#       years, forcing borrowing and small obligations.
#     - 'Severe economic crisis after a poor inundation year(s): debt, pawned goods,
#       and intensified heavy labor to keep the household afloat.'
#     phase: Midlife (family and labor consolidation)
#   - age_range: 42-50
#     key_events:
#     - Sister dies around age 47 (-3), shifting household balance and obligations;
#       joint household becomes more reliant on affinal ties.
#     - Continues as wage laborer despite aging body; reputation remains 'safe' and
#       honest, leading to steady (if low) access to hiring.
#     - Dies at 50 (9 AD) from an occupational accident—likely a fall or injury during
#       field/canal work with subsequent fatal infection.
#     phase: Later adulthood

#     death_age: 41
#     death_year: -3
#     name: Tathotes
#     narrative_role: Older sister and closest surviving kin; practical, protective,
#       and the main bridge to the joint household Pachompsais ends up living in. Their
#       bond is steady rather than demonstrative—she relies on his reliability, he relies
#       on her connections.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Reduces social risk and conflict with authorities/elders, but can
#       limit adaptability during economic shocks (hesitates to try new arrangements
#       or distant opportunities).
#     scene: He insists on doing tasks 'the way the elders taught'—same canal-walking
#       routes, same tying knots, same festival observances—and distrusts novel shortcuts
#       or unfamiliar tools, warning younger workers against 'clever' changes.
#     timing: visible from adolescence through adulthood (ages 12–50)
#     trait: Very low Openness (3rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Improves employability and steadiness despite poverty; also makes
#       him shoulder more burdens during crisis because others rely on his reliability.
#     scene: He arrives early to work-gang assembly, keeps tools maintained, remembers
#       obligations and repayments precisely, and is the one entrusted to return borrowed
#       items or measure out shared rations fairly in the joint household.
#     timing: especially adulthood (ages 18–50)
#     trait: High Conscientiousness (88th percentile)
#   - consequence: Protects him from feuds and retaliation, but can invite exploitation
#       (others may take advantage of his reluctance to accuse).
#     scene: In disputes over stolen tools or wage shortfalls, he avoids escalation—seeking
#       mediation, offering face-saving compromises, and accepting minor losses to preserve
#       working relationships and household peace.
#     timing: most visible during theft period and joint-household negotiations (ages
#       27–41)
#     trait: Very high Agreeableness (98th percentile)
#   - consequence: Builds trust and social credit, helping him borrow tools/food; but
#       limits ‘easy’ survival options when desperate.
#     scene: When handling pooled grain/fish in the joint household, he refuses to skim
#       or misreport; he also avoids petty theft even in scarcity, choosing heavier
#       labor instead.
#     timing: adulthood, especially during economic crisis (ages 32–37)
#     trait: High Honesty-Humility (92nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Helps household survive instability and navigate Roman-era administrative
#       pressure despite being illiterate.
#     scene: He quickly learns which employers pay reliably, how to time market trips
#       to avoid price spikes, and how to negotiate small obligations in kind; he remembers
#       complex informal accounts without writing.
#     timing: adolescence into midlife (ages 15–45)
#     trait: High Intelligence (81st percentile) expressed without literacy
#   - consequence: Stabilizes the household emotionally; may appear emotionally distant
#       to some kin because he expresses grief through work rather than talk.
#     scene: During scarcity and after family deaths, he remains outwardly calm and
#       task-focused, not easily panicked by rumors or sudden setbacks, leaning on routine
#       prayer/offerings rather than spiraling worry.
#     timing: throughout life, especially crisis years (ages 32–37) and after sister’s
#       death (age 47)
#     trait: Low Neuroticism (17th percentile)
# number_of_children: '1'
# number_of_siblings: '2'
# occupation: Agricultural wage laborer (fieldwork on others’ land/estates; seasonal
#   but primary livelihood)
# religion: 'Traditional Egyptian household/village cult: home offerings (food/incense/libations),
#   prayers to local deities, participation in local temple festivals/processions'
# sibling_ages_at_death:
# - 0
# - 41
# sibling_sexes:
# - M
# - F
# structured_incidents:
# - event: 'Recurring pattern: on more than one occasion, small but crucial items were
#     taken from his household/work life—such as a sickle, a coil of rope, or a bundle
#     of dried fish/reeds—most likely by someone in or passing through the village/fields,
#     forcing him to borrow or replace tools to keep earning wages.'
#   reasoning: Even poor households were vulnerable to petty theft (tools, animals,
#     stored grain) and small-scale fraud in markets or wage payment; repeated contact
#     with employers and markets raises lifetime exposure.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 27–35
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: 'Sustained period: after a poor inundation year and irregular hiring, he
#     fell behind on grain/obligations and borrowed at unfavorable terms; the household
#     cut meals, sold or pawned possessions, and he took any work available (including
#     heavy irrigation/levee labor) to prevent losing their place in the joint household
#     economy.'
#   reasoning: Near-landless wage laborers commonly faced debt spirals after bad Nile
#     years, illness, or employer loss; being childless also reduces labor/security
#     buffers in later life.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 32–37
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: 'Single event: as a young hired field hand, he began a courtship with a local
#     girl connected to a neighboring household; they had sex before any formally recognized
#     union, and afterward the families pushed for a socially acceptable arrangement
#     (a quiet marriage/recognition of the match) to avoid scandal.'
#   reasoning: For a poor rural man, courtship could involve informal unions and sex
#     before any fully recognized marriage; this is a common route to “nonstandard”
#     behavior without requiring wealth or ongoing opportunities.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 19–21
#   type: premarital_sex

Pachompsais was born in a village on the low ground of the Nile Delta when Egypt still belonged to the Ptolemaic kings. People in his house spoke Egyptian in the demotic tongue and kept the old village rites: a small clay lamp by the wall niche, a dish for bread and onions, a cup for beer poured out before the household images. His mother, Taesis, set out the offerings and said the names plainly—Osiris for the dead, Isis for protection, Sobek for the dangerous water, and the local forms of Horus who guarded fields and canals.

He arrived as the third child. The first, Petosiris, lived only long enough to be washed and wrapped. The second, his sister Tathotes, grew into a thin, sharp-eyed girl who learned early to watch the door and the baskets. Pachompsais came a year later. Taesis carried him to the riverbank when the air cooled at dusk and fanned him with a frayed reed mat to keep insects off his face.

His father, Haryotes, worked where he could: cutting and bundling stalks after harvest, hauling mud for repairs to dikes, taking day wages from men who held land. He came home with cracked heels and a smell of river water and sweat. Pachompsais remembered the weight of his father’s hand on his head and the way he sorted a pile of tools before sleep—knife on one side, sickle on the other, rope coiled tight. When Pachompsais was five, Haryotes stopped going out. He lay on a mat near the doorway, and Taesis boiled bitter herbs and pressed damp cloths against his skin. He died in the same season the birds thickened in the marshes.

After that, the household ran on what Taesis could manage and what Tathotes could do. Taesis worked with wet things: fish brought in from nets, small mullet and catfish split with a stone blade, salted and dried on racks; reeds cut and tied for mats and baskets. The smell of brine and mud stayed in their hair. Pachompsais carried bundles, fetched water, and learned to keep his hands away from the knife edge. He grew quiet. When another boy grabbed at a drying fish and ran, Pachompsais did not chase; he went straight to Taesis and said what happened, and she tightened the lashings on the rack and moved it closer to the house.

Tathotes became his steady point. She teased him when he checked the knots on a bundle twice before lifting. “You tie it for the river god,” she said once, and he answered that the river took what was loose. She laughed, then showed him a quicker knot anyway. In the evenings they sat outside with a bowl of lentils, listening to older women talk about the flood marks and prices. Pachompsais liked the simple foods best: bread still warm from the hearth and the sharpness of pickled greens. He took satisfaction in scraping a pot clean and setting it upside down in the same place each time.

When he was twelve, men in the village spoke of new rule. Officials in Greek came through more often; the talk at the threshing floor shifted to registers and demands, and the names of distant rulers changed. The new administration pressed harder on collection and transport. Pachompsais felt it as extra days of work called for canal clearing and dike repair, men ordered out in groups, each village expected to provide hands. Taesis told him to keep his eyes down when officials argued with local men. He did, even when his stomach tightened at raised voices.

By fifteen, he left home before sunrise to join work gangs. Panephremmis, an older man with a hoarse voice, gathered laborers at a crossroads and led them to whatever job paid: cutting barley, pulling weeds from flax, lifting baskets of mud to shore up a canal bank. Pachompsais worked hard and kept to himself. He did not gamble his wages on dice at the end of the day. He brought his share home, counted it into Taesis’s hand, and listened while she divided it between grain, salt, and what had to be paid.

He had one close friend among the young men, a cousin of an acquaintance called Psenthaes, who liked to sing short work songs under his breath. Psenthaes could make Pachompsais laugh with small jokes about Panephremmis’s sharp temper. They shared beer from the same cup at noon and traded bread crusts for dried fish. Pachompsais liked to sit with him on a low bank after work and watch boats move slowly through the reeds.

At twenty, he began walking a longer path past a neighboring cluster of houses, where Tachonsis lived. Her family processed grain for others, and she carried sacks on her hip with a steadiness that drew his eye. He spoke to her in short sentences, each one plain. She answered him with the same plainness. During the harvest season, after an evening of shared beer and quiet talk behind a storehouse, they slept together. The next day, gossip moved faster than Pachompsais could. Taesis spoke with Tachonsis's family, then with Panephremmis, and within weeks the families treated the match as fixed. The marriage was quiet: a meal shared, small gifts exchanged, and the move of Tachonsis into his household without ceremony that drew attention.

Two years later, Tachonsis gave birth to a daughter, Tasenouphis. The baby cried once, then struggled. Taesis warmed water, Tachonsis’s aunt rubbed oil into the child’s skin, and Pachompsais stood at the edge of the room with his hands clenched, saying nothing. The girl died the same day. Taesis placed a little bread and a few grains of salt by the household niche for Osiris and Isis, and Pachompsais repaired the broken reed mat without being asked.

As the years went on, Pachompsais and Tachonsis joined a joint household arrangement. They shared a dwelling compound with Harmachis and his wife Tasenet, pooling cooking and storage and dividing labor. Tasenet managed the pots and grain with a hard practicality; Pachompsais did not argue with her. Harmachis talked big when beer loosened his tongue and sometimes came home late from the canal-side stalls. Pachompsais kept out of those scenes. If he had a pleasure, it was early morning before the heat, when he could straighten a tool handle with a stone, check the cord on his water jar, and walk out to the hiring place without rush.

Between his late twenties and mid-thirties, petty theft bit into the household again and again. A sickle went missing after a day in the fields. A coil of rope disappeared from beside the door. Once a bundle of dried fish was taken from the rack while the household was away at work. Pachompsais did not shout accusations. He asked questions, listened, and borrowed replacements, paying back in careful portions. Pamenches, a neighbor who always seemed to have someone else’s tools, smirked when Pachompsais asked about the rope. Pachompsais let the smirk pass and tightened the locks on their storage jars.

When he was thirty-five, the flood came poor. The water rose late and did not sit high enough on the marks. Work became irregular. Grain prices jumped. The joint household fell behind on obligations, and Pachompsais borrowed at harsh terms—grain now for more grain later. Meals shrank to thin porridge and onions. They pawned small goods: a brass ring, a spare mat, a pot with a chipped rim. Pachompsais took whatever labor appeared, including the heavy jobs at the canal banks, hauling and tamping mud under a sun that left salt on his skin. Petechonsis, an estate agent with a tablet and a stick, watched the gangs and demanded speed. Pachompsais kept his mouth shut and finished each task, then went home and repaired the household’s worn sandals by the light of the clay lamp.

Taesis died when Pachompsais was forty-five. She had grown thin in her last years, spending more time sitting by the wall niche than working with fish and reeds. Pachompsais helped wash her body and placed bread and beer before Osiris's image the way she had taught him.

Tathotes died two years later. She had married and tied her life into a network of relatives that still touched his household; her death shifted obligations and removed a person who had always spoken to him without softness. At the memorial meal, Pachompsais poured a cup of beer onto the ground for her and spoke her name once.

He reached fifty with his joints stiff and his hands thickened from rope and soil. In the heat of midsummer, he worked with a gang clearing and strengthening a canal bank. He climbed onto a slick section of packed mud to pass up a basket, slipped, and fell hard. The cut on his leg looked small at first. Over the next days it swelled and darkened, and he could not put weight on it. He died in his village in July of the ninth year after the birth of the new era the Romans counted.

His body was prepared and bound in linen, then carried to a burial place outside the settled ground. Tachonsis placed bread, onions, and a cup of beer beside him, and the family spoke the names of Osiris and Anubis over the grave.
