Padmavati was born in early April of 890 in a hamlet near Akbarpur in the middle Ganga plain, where power shifted between big kings and local men who collected grain and labor in their name. Her people spoke an Indo-Aryan village tongue, and her household kept to Buddhist lay practice: offerings of lamps and flowers when a monk passed through, and visits to a nearby shrine when the path was dry.

Her father was already dead. Padmavati lived with her mother, Sumana, under the roof of her father’s kin. Her paternal grandmother, Dhanika, sat by the cooking place and gave orders in a thin voice. The family farmed a small holding and kept calves and a few goats; Sumana managed the animals and milk, rising before light to strain it and carry a pot to exchange for grain when there was any to spare.

Padmavati ran errands badly. She forgot small instructions and came back without what she had been sent for. She did not argue much when scolded. She stayed close to adults and did what she was told, even when her cousins slipped away to play.

One monsoon season, at five or six, she helped drive the goats and calves to graze by a pond. She stepped onto a slick bank, went down hard, and her shoulder shifted out. The elders pulled and set it and bound her arm to her side with cloth. For weeks she carried water awkwardly and cried when the strap rubbed.

After the next rains her mother took to her bedding with fever and shaking chills. Padmavati fetched water from the well, fanned Sumana through the hot afternoons, and stirred thin rice gruel while older women went to the fields and the men answered calls for road work and grain measures. Dhanika’s legs stiffened. Padmavati helped her to the courtyard each morning, brought chips of firewood, and washed her hands after eating.

In the dry season of 898 the household’s grain ran short. Padmavati ate little, coughed, and could not finish even watered rice. She died on April 3, a few days before her eighth birthday.
