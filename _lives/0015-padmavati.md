#   reasoning: Even if grandparents were present, primary elder-care responsibilities

Padmavati was born in the spring of 890 in a farming village near Akbarpur in the middle Ganga plain, where local headmen answered to shifting overlords tied to the Gurjara-Pratihara and Pala courts. Her household spoke the local Indo-Aryan village speech and lived from a small holding of rain-fed fields, paying grain dues when the collectors came and sending labor when the headman demanded it.

Her father was already dead. Her mother, Sita, stayed in the courtyard of her husband’s kin and slept with her daughters on a reed mat. Three girls had been born before Padmavati. The oldest, Anandi, was already helping at the edge of the fields. Another sister had died in infancy. The third, Lalima, would live into old age.

Padmavati followed the cattle and goats because her mother needed milk and dung and the older women needed hands in the crops. At the small shrine by the track she pressed her palms together when her grandmother said a short verse learned from monks who sometimes passed along the Ganga routes. When pilgrims and traders came through with salt and cloth, she stared and asked questions until she was sent back to the animals.

One rainy season, when she was six, the pond bank turned slick. She slipped while trying to pull a calf away from the water and her shoulder jumped out of place. The women hauled her home, and an elder pulled the joint and bound her arm tight with cloth and a bark splint. She kept using the hand anyway, clumsy and stubborn, until pain stopped her.

After the monsoon her mother took repeated fevers and sat folded against the wall. Padmavati carried water from the well, fanned flies away, and stirred thin rice gruel while her grandmother, Dharmi, struggled to stand. Padmavati brought her firewood chips and led her into the sunlit yard.

That winter the grain jar stayed low. Padmavati’s belly swelled and her legs thinned. A cough took hold after a bout of looseness. On April 3, 898, she died on the sleeping mat beside her mother.
