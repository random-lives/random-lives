#     for fuel to keep commuting.
#   reasoning: Sri Lanka experienced major economic turmoil (notably 2022), and even
#     middle-class households often faced debt stress, shortages, or sharp income shocks;

#     visible injury and a public scene before others separated them.
#   reasoning: For a confirmed violence perpetrator in this demographic, the overwhelmingly
#     most likely form is a non-lethal physical assault (fight with acquaintances, domestic
#     incident, workplace/community altercation), which is far more common than homicide
#     or sexual violence.

Ashen Perera was born on January 21, 2001, in Kalutara, in Sri Lanka’s Western Province. The country was under a central government in Colombo, and the civil war still shaped daily life through checkpoints, news of attacks, and the way adults talked about travel. His family spoke Sinhala at home and used English in small pieces, mostly from school and signs. They were Sinhalese Christians, and Sundays meant church clothes and a bus ride or a walk, depending on rain and money.

His father, Sunil Perera, left early each morning for laboring jobs. Some weeks it was construction, some weeks it was loading and unloading at a yard, sometimes cleaning up after other men with steadier pay had finished. Sunil’s hands stayed rough and cracked. His mother, Nirmala, stayed at home. She kept a tight list in her head: rice, dhal, kerosene, school books, medicine, what could wait. In the evenings she sat on the floor with the children’s uniforms and mended hems with quick stitches.

Ashen was the first child. Two younger siblings arrived later, a brother and a sister. Their house held three children’s noise even when Ashen kept quiet. He watched more than he spoke. When relatives came for visits, he stayed near the edge of the room, listening to the adults talk about wages, prices, and the buses.

School was close enough to walk. His Sinhala reading came easily, and he copied sentences in careful lines. He kept his exercise books tidy even when the rest of his bag turned into a mess of crumpled papers. English was a separate effort. He memorized lists and copied paragraphs until the words stayed. He did not volunteer in class. When teachers called on him, he stood and answered in a low voice, fast, and sat down again.

In 2009 the war ended. He was eight. Flags appeared, and the adults talked about it on buses and at tea stalls. Over the next few years, construction spread through the wider Colombo area, and people in Kalutara spoke about jobs in the city, better wages, and the cost of commuting. Sunil’s work became steadier for stretches. Ashen’s parents began to talk about sending him toward something that wasn’t daily labor.

He took the train and buses more often as he grew older, moving between Kalutara and the larger towns. He learned how to read faces in crowded carriages and how to guard a phone in his pocket. He did not pick fights, but he held grudges. Small slights stayed with him for days.

Church remained steady. Ashen joined youth activities for a while, then stopped going to the extra meetings. On Sundays he attended with his family and stood through the service. At home there were short prayers before meals when the family remembered, and longer prayers when someone was sick or money was short.

At eighteen, in 2019, the Easter Sunday bombings hit churches and hotels. The shock ran through the Western Province. For weeks, armed men stood at roadblocks, bags were checked, and people argued about politics and safety at bus stops. Ashen went to church with his parents and watched the new routines settle in—guards at gates, more eyes on strangers, more tension in public. He avoided crowded events and took longer routes to reduce the number of places he had to pass through.

By his early twenties he lived closer to Colombo for work. He found a job in the service sector in the suburbs, in a small hotel and restaurant setting where guests came through for meals, short stays, and functions. His tasks shifted depending on the day: cleaning tables, carrying supplies from the back, taking instructions from managers, dealing with small complaints. He kept his temper held tight, but it cost him. After work he sat silent on the bus, jaw clenched, replaying conversations.

He married young for his cohort, before he felt ready. His wife, Tharushi, came from a family that cared about steady work and a clean reputation. They met through a friend and spoke over the phone more than in person at first. He liked the structure of it: messages, agreed times, a predictable rhythm. They married legally and lived as spouses, renting a small place within commuting distance. Their daughter, Sewmi, was born soon after, and the house filled with the day-to-day needs of a baby: milk, cloths, doctor visits, sleep that broke into fragments.

In 2022 the country’s debt crisis hit hard. Fuel was scarce. Electricity cut out without warning. Prices jumped and kept jumping. Ashen’s workplace cut hours as customers disappeared and supplies became hard to get. His wages came late. He kept checking his phone for payment messages and refreshed bank screens until his eyes hurt. Each day he measured bus fares and food prices against what he had left.

He stood in fuel lines for hours to keep commuting. He left home before dawn, carrying a bottle of water and a packet of biscuits. The line moved slowly. Men argued, swore, and shouted at police. Ashen said little, but his hands shook when he tried to text Tharushi. When the fuel ran out, he walked to a bus stop and waited, sweating in work clothes. At night he sat at the table with a notebook and wrote down what he owed: rent, a small loan, phone bills. He borrowed money from relatives. He paid some bills late and others not at all. When Tharushi asked what would happen next month, he snapped at her, then went quiet and stared at the wall.

By 2023 and into 2024, things loosened but didn’t return to how they had been. Prices stayed high. Work stabilized in pieces. Ashen took extra shifts when they were offered, even when he felt sick with worry. He pushed himself through days with little sleep, then came home irritable, speaking sharply over small messes. He held his daughter carefully, and when she cried he paced the room until she settled.

Late in 2024, at work, a customer dispute turned into an argument. A man complained loudly at the counter. Another staff member tried to handle it. Ashen stepped in, trying to end it quickly, and the words went back and forth. The man cursed. Ashen’s face tightened. He shoved the man’s shoulder, then punched him. The sound was dull and clear in the room. The man stumbled and brought a hand to his face. Someone grabbed Ashen from behind. Another staff member pushed the injured man away. A small crowd formed at the entrance. Ashen’s breathing came in short pulls. He broke free once, then stopped when a manager shouted his name.

After that, his place at work narrowed. Supervisors watched him. Coworkers kept their conversations short. He did not explain himself well. He said the man had deserved it. He said he was tired of being spoken to like that. At home he avoided talking about it, and when Tharushi pressed him, he turned the conversation into complaints about money and respect.

By late 2025 Ashen lives in the Colombo suburbs with Tharushi and Sewmi. He leaves early, rides packed buses, and returns in the evening with his shoulders tight. He keeps his phone charged and checks prices before buying anything. On Sundays he puts on a clean shirt and goes to church with his family, standing close to them in the crowd. At home he washes dishes, folds small clothes, and sits on the floor with his daughter while she lines up toys and asks questions in a quick, clear voice. He answers her in Sinhala and slips in a few English words he picked up at work. He locks the door before bed and checks it once more after the lights go out.
