# historical_context:
# - event: Post-1992 market reforms and restructuring of state/collective enterprises
#     (SOE/COE layoffs, rise of private factories and service work), reshaping local
#     job security and wages in Anhui cities.
#   timing: age 5–15 (1992–2002)
# - event: Mass internal migration and tightening/loosening of hukou-linked access to
#     schooling, housing, and social services, affecting migrant families’ ability to
#     settle and their children’s education options in cities within Anhui.
#   timing: age 10–25 (1997–2012)
# - event: 2008 global financial crisis and China’s stimulus-era shifts, with knock-on
#     effects on export-linked manufacturing and local employment volatility for low-skilled
#     urban workers.
#   timing: age 21–23 (2008–2010)
# - event: Rapid expansion of smartphones, mobile payments, and online commerce (Alipay/WeChat
#     Pay), changing how wages are paid, bills handled, and increasing exposure to digital
#     fraud in everyday life.
#   timing: age 25–35 (2012–2022)
# - event: COVID-19 pandemic controls (lockdowns, testing regimes, travel restrictions)
#     with heavy impact on service-sector employment and household income stability
#     in Chinese cities.

# - event: After moving within Anhui for service work, she was hit by a phone/WeChat
#     scam posing as a delivery/bank verification and lost several thousand yuan from
#     her account, which she could not recover.
#   reasoning: Urban service-sector life and internal migration increase exposure to
#     theft and scams (phone/online fraud, wage theft), and economic vulnerability reduces

#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 30–32 (2017–2019)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: A bout of illness and repeated job loss left the household unable to keep
#     up with rent and medical bills; they borrowed heavily from relatives and small
#     lenders and had to move to cheaper housing.
#   reasoning: Her adult standing is explicitly downward with serious instability, making
#     episodes of debt, inability to pay rent/medical costs, or near-destitution relatively
#     likely at least once.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 33–35 (2020–2022)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: During escalating arguments over money and childcare, her husband slapped
#     and shoved her, leaving visible bruises; she stayed with relatives for several
#     days before returning.
#   reasoning: Being married, experiencing downward mobility and serious life stress,
#     and having high neuroticism all increase risk of intimate-partner conflict escalating
#     to physical violence; domestic violence is a frequent subtype among female victims.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 31–34 (2018–2021)
#   type: domestic_violence
# - event: While working in a restaurant/hotel service job, a drunk customer grabbed
#     and struck her during a dispute over payment/refund, and she was treated for minor
#     injuries at a local clinic.
#   reasoning: Service-sector work and urban living create some exposure to fights/assaults
#     (e.g., workplace/customer disputes), but rates are lower than domestic violence
#     for women and lower than property crime exposure.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 28–30 (2015–2017)
#   type: physical_assault

胡佳 was born on August 19, 1987, in Anqing in Anhui, under the People’s Republic of China. She was Han, and at home she heard the local Anqing speech while the television and school used Putonghua. Her family lived in a crowded three-generation household with her father’s parents. The apartment was tied to work and registration rules that decided who could live where and which school a child could attend.

Her father, 胡志强, worked on and off in a small workshop that made simple parts and did packing for larger factories. When the orders were good he left before dawn and came back with his hands stained by oil and dust. When the orders were bad he waited, smoking on the stairwell with other men, and listened for someone to mention a job. Her paternal grandfather, 胡德发, had been a rural laborer and then a watchman. He kept a tight grip on household spending, counting notes, folding them, and storing them deep in a drawer. Her grandmother, 李桂香, cooked and watched the child and argued with neighbors about water, noise, and who had taken which spot to dry bedding in the sun.

Her mother, 张玉兰, was away for stretches. She returned to the village to farm and to help her own parents, then came back to Anqing when there was work or when the family needed her. When she returned she carried sacks of rice and pickled vegetables, and she brought village news that did not match the city’s pace. There were weeks when Hu Jia’s mother was just a voice on a borrowed phone call. Hu Jia learned to swallow questions and do what the adults told her.

School started in a system already shifting under reform. After 1992, the city’s work units shrank and changed. Some families lost stable wages, and new private shops opened on the street. Hu Jia went to primary school with a backpack that was always neat. She copied characters until her wrist hurt. She corrected the spacing in her notebooks with an eraser worn down to a thin strip. When a teacher criticized her handwriting, she went home and rewrote the page three times. She watched her classmates run and shout; she talked too, but she checked herself, scanning faces to see whether she had said the wrong thing.

By middle school, migrant families in cities faced tighter and looser rules in turns, depending on fees and documents. Her household had gaps. Her father’s jobs shifted, and her mother’s village work pulled her away again. Hu Jia learned early how to carry proof: a household booklet kept in plastic, receipts folded into squares, photocopies that mattered. She listened to adults talk about hukou and school placement without fully understanding why the same child could be accepted one year and refused the next.

She finished junior secondary school and did not go far beyond it. She tried vocational classes, then left when money got tight and the commute and fees felt pointless. She found work through friends of friends: washing dishes, clearing tables, wiping rooms. She moved within Anhui in her twenties, first to a county seat with more hotels near a transport hub, then to a bigger city where her cousin had a bed in a shared room. She sent part of her pay home. She kept a careful list of expenses in the notes app on her phone and checked it at night.

At twenty-eight she worked at a mid-range hotel restaurant. The hours ran through lunch and dinner, and her feet swelled in cheap shoes. One night a man at a banquet table drank too much and demanded a refund for dishes already eaten. The manager told Hu Jia to handle it because she was nearby. The man stood, grabbed her arm hard, and struck her across the face when she tried to step away. The room went quiet for a moment, then loud again. Someone pulled him back. The manager apologized to the table to keep the peace. Hu Jia went to a local clinic for a check and left with a small bag of medicine, the smell of disinfectant in her hair.

She married 胡军 in her late twenties. He worked in delivery and odd construction jobs, taking what he could find. They rented a small place and then another, following landlords, prices, and job sites. She gave birth to two boys, 胡浩然 and 胡子轩. She moved through days in a tight loop: school drop-offs, shopping, sweeping, preparing food, shifts when she had them, and the constant checking of messages. She spoke Putonghua easily at work and slipped into local dialect with older neighbors and family.

When smartphones and mobile payments became normal, money moved faster than she could track. In 2018, a message arrived that looked official, with a logo and a warning about a delivery and a bank verification. She was juggling the boys’ schedule and a shift change and a call from her mother. She clicked the link. She entered details. Within minutes several thousand yuan was gone. The customer-service numbers went nowhere. The police station took a report and told her scams were common. She went home sick with anger at herself and scrubbed the kitchen until her hands were raw.

Money fights began to fill the apartment. Her husband blamed her for the loss. She blamed him for not bringing in enough and for disappearing with friends when she needed help. Late in 2019, arguments turned physical. During one fight about school fees and debt, he slapped her and shoved her into a cabinet. Bruises showed on her upper arm and shoulder. The boys watched from the doorway without moving. The next morning she packed a bag and took them to her aunt’s place. Her aunt, 胡秀兰, lived in an older building and said little, just set out a quilt and cooked plain noodles. After several days Hu Jia went back, because the rent was due and because she had no plan that could last.

COVID-19 brought controls that cut into the service jobs she relied on. Hotels emptied. Restaurants closed or reduced staff. Her husband’s work slowed too. In 2020 she got sick with a lingering condition that made work harder and sleep worse. Some days she lay down after sending the boys to school and woke with her heart racing. She kept cleaning anyway, wiping already clean surfaces, checking the stove knobs, rechecking the door lock until her fingers ached. Medical bills accumulated in small amounts that added up. They borrowed from relatives first, then from small lenders that promised quick money and harsh terms. Calls came at odd hours. She kept her phone on silent during the day, then checked missed calls with a tight jaw.

By 2021 they had to move again, this time to cheaper housing farther from the boys’ school. The apartment was damp, and the stairwell smelled of cooking oil and old concrete. She calculated bus fares and school supplies down to the yuan. Sometimes she snapped at her children for leaving crumbs on the table, then apologized and handed them fruit cut into precise pieces.

Her mother aged faster than Hu Jia expected, and her father’s parents needed help too. As an only child she could not pass the duty to siblings. She managed hospital registrations on her phone, waited in lines, argued with clerks about missing documents, and carried bags of medicine up stairs. She fought with her husband when he refused to take a day off to accompany her. She did it herself.

By 2024, the strictest pandemic controls had ended, but her household did not rebound. She picked up short-term work: cleaning guest rooms when a small hotel needed extra hands, helping in a canteen for a month, then nothing for weeks. She kept a small notebook for the boys’ expenses and another for debt payments. She watched her sons grow taller and louder. She pushed them to finish homework before touching a phone.

In late 2025, Hu Jia lives in a rented apartment in an Anhui city, with her husband and two sons. She wakes early, makes porridge, and checks her phone for messages from school and from creditors. She keeps the bills in an envelope inside a drawer, stacked in order by date. She walks the boys to the bus stop, stands until the bus pulls away, and then turns toward the market to compare prices on vegetables before she goes to a cleaning shift.
