#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Creates minor tensions and prompts the household to assign her more
#       hearth-based, supervised processing tasks during vulnerable periods.
#     scene: She occasionally neglects meticulous tool maintenance and forgets to finish
#       drying or storing foods when distracted, especially around episode onset; others
#       step in to check her bundles.
#     timing: Midlife (33-55), especially during early episodes
#     trait: Conscientiousness (35th percentile; somewhat low)
#   - consequence: 'Mixed social impact: occasional friction when her warnings conflict
#       with hungry hunters’ plans, but also increased ritual authority when her predictions
#       appear validated by later mishaps avoided.'
#     scene: She reports hearing a particular animal calling her name at night and becomes
#       convinced a hunt must be delayed; during stronger episodes she speaks to unseen
#       presences and misreads ordinary shadows as animals.
#     timing: Begins age 33; recurring through 78
#     trait: Psychotic-spectrum disorder (visible)
#   - consequence: Keeps her anchored in dependable provisioning roles; reinforces her
#       reputation as steady worker rather than strategist, until visions shift her
#       social niche.
#     scene: She learns best through repetition and demonstration rather than improvisation;
#       she excels at routine processing sequences but relies on Nalini/Silani for complex
#       negotiation between households.
#     timing: Adolescence through adulthood
#     trait: Intelligence (41st percentile; slightly below average, not extreme)
# number_of_children: '2'
# number_of_siblings: '4'
# occupation: Gatherer and plant-food processor (with childcare; daily provisioning)
# religion: Hunting/animal-power rituals (pre-hunt songs/dances, apology rites to prey,
#   use of animal parts as charms)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: 'After a severe fever with frightening visions, she stopped taking part in
#     some of the usual pre-hunt apology rites and instead insisted on new precautions:
#     a short night chant at the edge of camp and a small smear-offering of fat and
#     ash at a particular tree near water before anyone set out. Over time others treated
#     her as someone who had been ''touched'' by a strong animal-spirit and deferred
#     to her omens about when not to hunt.'
#   reasoning: Beliefs were embedded in daily practice and tradition rather than formal
#     creed; major conversion-like change is uncommon, though personal shifts after
#     illness/visions could occur.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 27–31 (shift begins after an illness and stabilizes into a sustained
#     change)
#   type: religious_change
# - event: From midlife onward she had recurring periods of confusion and hearing/seeing
#     things others did not, with weeks where she could not reliably range far to gather
#     and instead stayed close to the hearth doing food processing and childcare. Between
#     episodes she could function and advise others, but the condition returned intermittently
#     for decades.
#   reasoning: Chronic pain/degenerative problems, recurrent infections, or long-term
#     mental illness are common pathways to being “ill” yet surviving; her confirmed
#     psychotic-spectrum condition also supports ongoing limitation.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 33–78 (recurring pattern with intermittent episodes)
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: During a difficult stretch in which her band was moving frequently and she
#     feared she could not carry another child, she drank a strong bitter infusion of
#     locally known abortifacient roots/leaves prepared by an older woman and took repeated
#     hot baths by the fire. She then bled heavily for several days and the group treated
#     it as a dangerous 'cleansing' rather than an openly discussed choice.
#   reasoning: Knowledge of abortifacient plants and attempts to end pregnancies existed
#     in many premodern societies but were not routine; probability is low-to-moderate
#     over a long reproductive span.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 24 (single event over several days)
#   type: abortion_attempt

Paravi was born into a Terai forager band that moved between grassland edges and riverine thickets in the lowlands south of the Himalayan foothills. No chiefs taxed them and no temples anchored them; decisions sat with older hunters and senior women. Her people spoke their own tongue and treated animals, water places, and the dead as presences that required attention. Before a hunt, fat and ash went onto bark or stone, and a few names of ancestors were spoken aloud so the living would not be careless.

Her father, Tiru, carried a heavy spear and a bundle of points and scrapers, and she watched him check the wind with wet fingers. Her mother, Kanni, fed the camp more reliably than any hunt: tubers pried from damp ground, small fruits, and handfuls of seeds brought back in baskets. Paravi was the third child. Koti, the older brother, had already started ranging with men; Nalini stayed close to Kanni and learned where the edible shoots came up after rain. When Paravi was small, her grandmother Maravi sat near the fire and told children which trees were dangerous at night and which pools carried sickness. Paravi learned early to split fibrous stems, twist cord, and keep her digging stick from warping in the heat.

Maravi died when Paravi was twelve. The band set the body on a cleared patch above the damp ground, kept dogs away, and marked the place with stones. Kanni pressed ash onto the stones with the heel of her hand and left a small lump of fat beside them. Paravi watched Koti stand off to the side, jaw tight, as if he were still tracking something. After that, when Paravi had trouble sleeping, she went to the edge of camp and sat where she could hear frogs and night insects near water. She liked the moment just before dawn when the air cooled and the first birds started.

As a girl, she stayed thin and short for her age, quick on her feet but not strong in the shoulders. Nalini teased her for carrying light loads and then handed her another basket anyway. Koti sometimes brought her a marrow bone and acted as if it were nothing; she cracked it with a stone and grinned at the grease on her hands. Paravi didn’t hold a set of rules in her head the way Nalini did. She forgot where she had tucked a scraper, left a bundle of drying roots too close to smoke, and took scoldings without much argument. She worked hard when someone put the job directly in front of her.

By her late teens she traveled farther from camp, following Kanni to patches of tubers and to stands of fruit where monkeys also came. She learned which roots needed long cooking and which seeds had to be pounded and winnowed. She liked the steady rhythm of pounding and the taste of roasted tubers with saltless fat. In the evenings she laughed easily at other women’s jokes, especially when Silani—her younger sister—imitated an arrogant hunter’s walk to make the girls snort with laughter.

At twenty, Paravi took up with Aravi, a hunter from a nearby allied group. She moved to his household cluster, still within the wider lowlands, but far enough that she stopped seeing her own mother every season. Aravi’s sister Kanali watched her closely at first, measuring her work and her temper. Paravi kept her head down, dug, carried, and processed food until the older women stopped treating her like a guest. She and Aravi slept under the same shelter, with other hearths close enough that words carried through the dark.

Tiru died when Paravi was twenty-two. A hunting injury turned bad, and the men brought his body back on a litter of branches. Paravi went back to her birth band for the rites, sat with Kanni, and kept her hands busy scraping hide because stillness made her thoughts race. When she returned to Aravi’s people, she pushed herself to gather more than before. That year she became pregnant.

Her first child, Niravi, lived three years. The girl walked, grabbed at cords, and learned to chew softened foods. Then a sickness came through the camp, and Niravi stopped eating and cried until her voice went hoarse. Paravi carried her from shade to shade, wiped her mouth, and begged for help from any spirit that listened. The child died, and Paravi stayed near the hearth for days, turning food she did not taste and snapping at anyone who touched her bundles.

At twenty-four, during a stretch of repeated moves when game was scarce and the band shifted camps quickly to keep up, Paravi realized she was pregnant again. She went to Velani, an older woman in Aravi’s kin group who knew plants that could bring bleeding. Velani crushed bitter roots and leaves, steeped them, and told Paravi to drink. Paravi did, then sat by the fire and took hot baths from water warmed in skin bags. Heavy bleeding followed and lasted days. No one spoke of it in front of men. Kanali watched Paravi’s face and said only, “Eat when you can.”

Paravi did become pregnant again later. Talavi came at twenty-eight and died at birth. Paravi didn’t wail; she went silent and rigid, then forced herself to stand and wash the blood away with cold water. She avoided the river pool where she had cleaned herself and chose a different place to draw water for months.

A year after Talavi’s death, Paravi caught a fever that left her shaking and drenched. She heard animal calls that did not match any bird or deer. She saw a dark shape by the water tree and said it was waiting for the hunters. When she could stand again, she refused the usual quick apology rite at the kill site. Instead, before anyone left camp to hunt, she insisted on a short chant at the edge of the sleeping circle and a smear of fat mixed with ash on the trunk of a specific tree near water. Aravi argued once, hungry and angry; Paravi stared him down until he turned away. After a hunter slipped in mud and broke his arm on a day she warned against, the men stopped mocking her. Some began to ask her, quietly, whether the night was safe for a hunt.

Koti died when Paravi was twenty-five, cut down in a fight with another group near a water crossing. She heard the news later, when her birth band visited. It tightened something in her. She became more insistent about timing and about leaving offerings, and she began to speak the names of the dead before hunts: Maravi, Tiru, Koti. She kept a small bundle of ash in a folded leaf packet near her sleeping place and used it for the tree smear.

When Paravi was thirty-three, her mind began to slip at intervals. She heard voices at night that argued with each other and sometimes called her to leave camp. On bad weeks she walked out toward the grassland edge as if she had a task and then stopped, confused, until someone came for her. Nalini, visiting from the birth band, took her by the elbow once and led her back without speaking. After that, Aravi and Kanali kept Paravi closer to the hearth during spells. She processed food, scraped hides, and braided cord where others could watch her hands.

Those episodes returned over decades. Between them, Paravi worked steadily and spoke with calm authority.

Kanni, her mother, died when Paravi was forty-six. Paravi returned to the birth band and sat with the body through a full night, pressing ash into the stones and speaking the names she had memorized as a girl. After that, no one from her mother's generation remained except the old women who had married in. Paravi felt the weight of being one of the senior women now.

She began to take on children that weren't hers. Silani’s daughter, Pavi, ended up at Paravi’s hearth often, fed and scolded and taught to sort edible seeds from bitter ones. When Silani died at forty-two, Paravi pulled Pavi fully into her household and treated her as a daughter in practice even if not by blood. She also washed and fed a sick older man from Aravi’s line when he could no longer chew; she mashed softened foods for him and kept flies away.

Nalini died when Paravi was fifty-three. Paravi returned for the funeral and stood as one of the senior women, directing the placement of stones and the ash press. After that, her standing rose further. Hunters asked her if the water tree needed fat before a long trip. Younger women brought her questionable roots to check. She enjoyed the quiet pride of teaching Pavi to dry tubers properly and seeing the bundles keep through the damp season. She also enjoyed sitting with her youngest sister Veli when Veli visited—both of them old later, both sharp-tongued in small ways—and trading stories about Koti’s teasing and the embarrassing mistakes of the young.

In her seventies, Paravi’s confused periods came less like storms and more like dull stretches. She sometimes forgot a bundle outside and ruined it with rain; Kanali snapped at her, then softened and brought her roasted seeds as if to erase the harsh words. Paravi kept doing the departure chant even when her voice rasped. Aravi stayed beside her, older and slower, but still holding his spear when he went out.

At eighty-three, in the cold part of the year, Paravi drank from a water container that had been fouled. She developed severe diarrhea and could not keep water down. Aravi and Pavi tried to drip water into her mouth and keep her warm by the fire, but she continued to lose fluid until she could no longer sit up.

Her body was placed on higher ground near the camp’s dead stones, wrapped in hides. Pavi pressed ash and a smear of fat onto a flat stone at the head and spoke the names Paravi had used for years before hunts.
