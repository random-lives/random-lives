Uma was born on a cool December day in 369 in a small hamlet on the flat ground between channels of the Ganga. Her parents spoke the local Prakrit at home. The family lived in a one-room mud house with a thatch roof at the edge of the fields.

Her father went out before sunrise when someone hired him. In sowing and harvest he carried home grain for his pay. In slack weeks he received a few small copper coins and work to be counted later. The land he ploughed belonged to others. When he had no wages, there was less food and less oil for the lamp.

Her mother stayed close to the hearth. She ground grain on a stone, cooked thin porridge, fetched water in an earthen pot, and kept the fire alive with dried stalks. The older sister swept and watched the younger ones when their mother’s hands were busy. The two brothers ranged around the huts and the field edges until they were called back. Another child had died before Uma was born; her mother did not speak that name, and her father kept his face hard when the subject came near.

After Uma’s birth her mother lit the household lamp and placed a pinch of rice aside before the family shrine space. On the nights of the dark moon she followed the village women’s rules for the ancestors, quiet and exact, because mistakes felt dangerous in a house that owned little.

In 370, standing water remained in the ditches after the rains. Mosquitoes rose at dusk and clung to the walls inside the house. Late in the year Uma’s skin turned hot. She refused the breast and cried until her voice thinned. Her mother kept her against her chest and tried to cool her with damp cloth. Her father lost two days of work walking to a healer who mixed bitter herbs and spoke a chant over the child.

The fever returned each night. On December 29, 370, it did not break. Uma’s breathing slowed, then stopped in her mother’s arms.
