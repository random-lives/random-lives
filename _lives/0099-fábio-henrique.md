#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Limits educational/career advancement, creates marital friction over
#       bills and routines, and contributes to inconsistent hypertension medication
#       adherence.
#     scene: As a teen he forgets notebooks, misses deadlines, and improvises excuses;
#       as an adult he misplaces receipts and occasionally opens the shop late, despite
#       genuinely wanting to do well.
#     timing: visible from later childhood through adulthood (1992-2026)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (very low, 1st percentile)
#   - consequence: Builds strong local trust and repeat customers; also makes him vulnerable
#       to being over-relied-upon or taken advantage of with extra favors.
#     scene: In retail he refuses to short-change customers or sell damaged goods as
#       new; when the cash is off he insists on checking rather than blaming coworkers.
#     timing: young adulthood onward (2001-2026)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (very high, 96th percentile)
#   - consequence: Keeps relationships intact under strain, but he avoids confrontation
#       (e.g., delaying hard talks about budgets or boundaries).
#     scene: During Aline’s illness he de-escalates conflicts and absorbs criticism
#       without exploding; in family meetings he mediates between Patrícia’s bluntness
#       and Diego’s frustration.
#     timing: adulthood caregiving years especially (2012-2026)
#     trait: Agreeableness (very high, 92nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Protective against panic/rumination; occasionally leads others to
#       feel he under-reacts or 'doesn’t worry enough' until problems become urgent.
#     scene: When crises hit—Aline’s sleepless nights, father’s wound care, pandemic
#       uncertainty—he stays unusually calm and action-focused, sometimes seeming emotionally
#       'flat' to others.
#     timing: adulthood (2012-2022 especially)
#     trait: Neuroticism (very low, 6th percentile)
#   - consequence: Compensates for low conscientiousness (he can 'save' situations at
#       the last minute), earns informal respect, but also creates a pattern of procrastination
#       because he can often recover.
#     scene: He quickly learns product details, pricing, and customer needs; he can
#       mentally calculate discounts and spot inconsistencies faster than coworkers,
#       and he gives practical advice to neighbors navigating bureaucracy.
#     timing: school years through work life (1990-2026)
#     trait: Intelligence (very high, 98th percentile)
#   - consequence: Fewer casual opportunities; pushes him toward relationships built
#       through church/community familiarity and trust.
#     scene: In adolescence he is teased or overlooked in dating; he learns to rely
#       on humor, kindness, and reliability in community spaces rather than looks.
#     timing: adolescence to early adulthood (1996-2007)
#     trait: Physical attractiveness (very low, 2nd percentile)
# number_of_children: '3'
# number_of_siblings: '3'
# occupation: Commerce/retail sales or shop work (salesperson, store clerk, cashier,
#   sales rep; possibly in family business)
# religion: Evangelical/Pentecostal practice (frequent church services; prayer meetings;
#   Bible reading; avoidance of saints; tithing common)
# sibling_ages_at_death:

# sibling_sexes:

# - M
# - F
# structured_incidents:
# - event: He developed hypertension that was picked up at a local posto de saúde after
#     recurring headaches and high readings; over the years he cycled between taking
#     the prescribed medication regularly and lapsing, with periods of fatigue and dizziness
#     that affected his ability to keep long shifts in retail.
#   reasoning: By the early 40s, chronic conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, chronic
#     back pain, gastritis) are very common and often create ongoing limitations, even
#     for middle-class adults.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 33–42 (diagnosed around 33–35; ongoing thereafter)
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: A close family member (his wife) went through a prolonged episode of depression
#     and anxiety with sleep disruption; he took over school drop-offs, meal shopping,
#     and managing the house on days she was unable, while accompanying her to appointments
#     in the region (Timbaúba/Goiana area).
#   reasoning: Extended caregiving for an ill/disabled relative (spouse, child, sibling)
#     occurs for a substantial minority, but is less common than elder-care in this
#     life stage.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 29–32
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: As his parents aged, his father developed diabetes complications (including
#     foot wounds) and needed frequent clinic visits and help with medications; because
#     he lived nearby, he became the main person arranging transport, buying supplies,
#     and handling errands while balancing work at the shop.
#   reasoning: In Brazil it is very common for adult children to become primary coordinators/caregivers
#     for aging parents/in-laws; staying near birthplace increases the chance he was
#     the available caregiver.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 36–42
#   type: elderly_parents
# - event: Before he married, he had a girlfriend from his neighborhood/church social
#     circle and they had consensual sex in their late teens/early twenties, keeping
#     it discreet from family and church leaders.
#   reasoning: In this 1983 Brazilian cohort, premarital sex is widespread even among
#     religious people, and is the most likely way to have a 'nonstandard' sexual history.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 18–21
#   type: premarital_sex

Fábio Henrique was born on November 19, 1983, in Timbaúba, in Pernambuco’s Zona da Mata Norte. Brazil was coming out of military rule, and local politics shifted fast as new mayors, new rules, and new promises arrived. His family spoke Portuguese in a Northeastern accent, prayed in Pentecostal churches, and lived in a straightforward house-run rhythm: his father went to work, his mother worked retail hours, and the children learned early to help each other.

His father, José Henrique, held a supervisory job connected to local commerce and small industry. He dressed neatly for work and cared about being respected. His mother, Marlene, left the house in a uniform or simple blouse and went to her job in a shop, sometimes returning tired and talkative, with bits of news about customers and prices. In the late 1980s the adults talked about money constantly because prices changed and wages lost value. Marlene brought home groceries in small quantities because buying too much at once felt risky. José Henrique kept a pencil behind his ear and tried to calculate what the household could manage.

Fábio was the second child. His older sister, Patrícia, arrived in 1981 and had a bossy streak from early on. She liked order and hated surprises. Fábio learned words quickly and read fast once school began, but he lost pencils, forgot notebooks, and walked out of the house with his shirt untucked and one shoe unlaced. Patrícia pulled him back by the sleeve and fixed him without much ceremony. When he was three, his brother Diego was born. Diego watched everything and copied, then complained when Fábio got praised for something he hadn’t prepared for.

In 1989, Marlene brought home a baby girl, Larissa. The house rearranged itself around the crib. Fábio hovered and tried to make the baby laugh, pulling faces and bouncing a plastic toy. Larissa fell ill the next year and died before she turned two. After that, their church visits tightened into routine. Sundays were not optional. José Henrique led short prayers in the living room with a worn Bible and a glass of water on the table. Marlene said prayers over the children before school. Patrícia stopped teasing Diego for a while. Fábio began to go quiet when the subject came up, then changed it with a question about anything else.

School exposed his contradictions. He answered questions with speed that made teachers pause, then came the next day without the workbook. He could do mental arithmetic that embarrassed older cousins, but he missed deadlines because he forgot the assignment existed. José Henrique scolded him over unfinished tasks, then softened when Fábio explained something with sharp logic. Marlene defended him as long as she could, but she also got tired of signing notes for missed work. Patrícia became the one who checked his bag before he left. Diego mocked him for it at home and benefited from the attention that followed.

When Brazil stabilized its currency in the mid-1990s, the change was obvious even in Timbaúba’s shops. Prices stopped jumping overnight. Adults stopped swapping rumors about new plans and confiscations. José Henrique looked less tense at dinner. Marlene began to talk about buying things on installment—an appliance, school supplies in bulk—without the immediate fear that the numbers would turn absurd by the end of the month. Fábio noticed the shift through the rhythm of the markets: fewer arguments at the counter, more customers browsing.

Teenage years brought church youth nights, music played loud enough to be heard outside, and small dramas that turned into gossip quickly. Pastor Elias learned everyone’s names and took a special interest in boys who seemed smart but drifted. Fábio listened carefully in Bible study and remembered verses, then forgot to show up to help set up chairs. He was easy to like. He laughed easily and didn’t hold grudges. Kids who teased him about his looks—his awkward smile and uneven features—didn’t get the reaction they wanted. He shrugged, told a quick joke, and moved on. The calm made some people stop and some people push harder.

After finishing school, he stayed in Timbaúba and stepped into commerce. In 2001 he started dating Rosa, a girl from the same social circle who liked long walks near the town center and sweet snacks from street vendors. They kept their relationship close to the church’s expectations in public. In private, they crossed those lines. It became a recurring secret, with bursts of closeness followed by anxious talks about what they would do if someone found out. Fábio could talk for hours about plans—moving out, steady work, marriage—then fail to act on the next small step. In 2004, the relationship ended in a final argument outside her house, quiet voices, and a quick goodbye.

Work suited his mind and exposed his habits. In a shop owned by Seu Raimundo, he learned product details quickly and could explain options to customers in plain terms. He calculated discounts faster than the register sometimes did. If a customer returned angry, he listened without getting defensive and solved the problem. He refused to short-change anyone, even when other workers hinted that “everyone does it.” When the cash count didn’t match, he stayed after closing and checked it again until the mistake was found. Then he arrived late the next morning because he had forgotten to set the alarm.

He met Aline in 2006 through church connections and mutual friends. She was direct, organized, and the kind of person who wrote down phone numbers and kept them. He proposed in a simple way that embarrassed him later: no speech, just a question in her mother’s kitchen. They married in 2009, civil and church, with photographs that showed Fábio smiling in a stiff suit. Their first child, Letícia, was born in 2010. He held her carefully, then forgot the diaper bag on the first trip to the clinic. Aline yelled at him in the car. He apologized without arguing and bought what they needed on the way.

João Pedro arrived in 2013. The household became noisier. Fábio liked early mornings before the children woke, coffee strong and sweet, standing at the doorway listening to the street. He enjoyed tapioca with butter from a stall near the market and sometimes brought it home as a peace offering after an argument. He avoided paperwork. Bills piled up in a drawer until Aline forced a sorting session at the table.

In 2012, Aline’s mood shifted. She stopped sleeping, then stopped eating properly. She cried in the bathroom with the tap running. Fábio took on school drop-offs and shopping, often with a list in his pocket that he lost and then reconstructed from memory in the aisle. He drove her to appointments in the region, waiting on plastic chairs, holding a folder of papers he tried not to misplace. Patrícia came over to help, blunt with Aline and brisk with Fábio. Diego started showing up for errands without being asked. Through those years, Fábio stayed steady in tone even when the house felt unstable. Aline improved by 2015, but the memory stayed in their routines: quieter evenings, a shared rule that sleep mattered.

The national recession hit their town’s commerce in 2014 and 2015. Customers bought less and argued more over prices. Fábio watched sales slow and tried to make up the difference by working longer, though he still struggled to show up on time. In 2017, Helena was born, and the family expanded again just as money felt tighter.

In 2017, a nurse at the local posto de saúde took his blood pressure twice and told him to sit still. He had been getting headaches and blamed heat and poor sleep. The diagnosis was hypertension. He accepted the medication and made a show of taking it regularly, then began skipping days when he felt fine. During busy stretches at the shop he forgot refills. Dizziness caught him in mid-sentence one afternoon, and he leaned on the counter until it passed.

By 2019, José Henrique’s diabetes worsened. Foot wounds needed cleaning and attention. Fábio became the family’s main coordinator because he lived nearby and didn’t refuse when asked. He handled transport, bought dressings and supplies, and kept track of clinic dates by writing them on his phone and also on a scrap of paper that he sometimes lost. Diego backed him up when work conflicted with appointments. Marlene stayed close, watching every detail, tired but sharp.

COVID-19 changed the town’s routines in 2020. The shop’s hours shifted. Church gatherings moved, returned, and changed again. Fábio’s medication adherence fell apart during the disruption; he missed days and felt it in his body. In 2021, Dra. Camila at the posto de saúde restarted the conversation in plain terms and made him commit to a schedule. Letícia, now older, reminded him without making it a fight.

Late 2025 finds him still in Timbaúba, married, working in retail, moving between the shop, the clinic, and home. He jokes with regular customers, never cheats them, and still arrives five minutes late more often than he intends. At night he checks his father’s supplies, helps Helena with a small school task, and sits with Aline while she watches television. He takes his pill with water from a cup kept by the sink, then leaves the box in view so he won’t forget the next day.
