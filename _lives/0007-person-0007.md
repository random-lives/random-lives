They called him Arani, a name said fast and low so it carried across the huts without drawing attention. He was born in the Cerrado uplands, where the grass stood high after the rains and the ground stayed warm at night. Smoke from the cooking fire hung under the shade frame. His mother delivered on a sleeping mat while the older women kept the small children back. His father stayed at the edge of the clearing, watching the paths that led to the water.

Their household held together: mother, father, and the children who remained. Arani was the second birth. The first had been a boy who lived only a few breaths. The next was a girl who lasted through one wet season and into the dry, then burned with fever and went still. After that, his parents chose camps with cleaner water and moved sooner when flies thickened around the pots.

His father’s hunting made the family prominent. He followed tracks in sand and ash, waited by game trails, and brought down animals with throwing spears. He butchered with sharp stone traded from distant kin and handed out the best cuts in front of everyone. People measured him by that: whether he shared quickly, whether he held anything back.

His mother kept the ties that made a camp last. She walked to related camps with bundles of dried meat, cordage, and feathers. She came back with stone, resin for hafting, and word of where sickness had started and which waterholes tasted foul. Arani rode against her hip on those trips, his face pressed into her shoulder when strangers spoke too close.

When the dry season turned, illness came into their shelter anyway. Arani’s stools turned to water. His skin stayed hot. Then his breathing tightened and a cough cut his sleep into short, panicked pulls. His mother kept him at her breast and tried to drip water between his lips. By the next moon he stopped swallowing, and his chest rose less each time until it did not rise again.
