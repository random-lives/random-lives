They called him Piraju, a name that meant red river. It was spoken in the words his family used around their fires, out in the open Cerrado where they moved as water and game shifted.

He was born on a low rise above a narrow stream, where grass gave way to twisted trees and a strip of darker forest along the water. Days were hot. Nights could cool fast. His mother held him close from the first hour, keeping him against her skin when the wind came up.

Piraju was the second child. His older brother died the same day Piraju arrived. Later, his sister lived long enough to walk, then burned with fever for a short time and went still. After that, their parents kept the children close at night. When the camp stayed, they slept under a lean-to of poles and palm thatch. When it was time to leave, the shelter came down and the bundle loads went up.

His father was listened to. He could read tracks in sandy ground and pick the places where deer crossed at dusk. When he brought meat back, he cut it cleanly and passed it out in the order people expected. It kept arguments from starting and kept the people who mattered on his side.

His mother carried food and useful things between kin. She brought smoked meat, cord, and feathers to other camps and returned with sharp stone, resin, and word of where hunting had been good or bad. Piraju went with her, tied against her hip, his face turned inward when the sun was hard.

At night, people sang and stamped around the fire for births, deaths, and the return of hunters. Near the end of the rains, Piraju’s stools turned thin and frequent. His skin stayed hot. Soon he began to cough, and the cough took his breath while he tried to nurse. He weakened over days. His mother kept him in her arms until he stopped moving and would not wake.
