Taku was born on May 7, 365 BC in the Cerrado uplands, in the country that lies north of today’s Minas Gerais. His family moved with a small band between streams and the darker strips of woodland, putting up shelters where there was water, game, and roots to dig, then leaving when the place was picked over or another camp settled too close.

When he was born the household was his mother and father and one living child. He was the second of three births. The first, a boy, died during delivery. The third, a girl, lived a year and then died in a fever.

His father’s work fed the camp and kept his name in use. Before dawn he went out with other men, following tracks across dry grass and sandy ground. He carried a bow with arrows and a spear for close work. When he brought back deer or smaller animals, he did not keep the best cuts for his own shelter. He handed them over in front of the older men, and they watched him do it.

His mother kept their ties with other camps from thinning out. She visited kin and other bands with bundles of smoked meat, cord, and feathers. She came back with stone for cutting and scraping, with resin for fixing points to shafts, and with news about where people were gathering next. When she walked, she carried Taku tight against her side under a cloth wrap. He slept and woke to voices, singing, and the steady stamp of feet on hard ground.

The deaths of the older baby and the girl made his parents careful with water and with strangers, but they could not live alone. People shared the same stream edges and the same shelters when storms came. Visitors arrived hungry or sick and stayed close to the fire.

Near the end of the rains in 364 BC, Taku began to pass watery stool. His mouth stayed wet with nursing but he weakened, and fever followed. After that he started to cough, short and sharp, breaking his latch and leaving him breathing fast between cries. He died on April 24, 364 BC, in the same shelter where he had been born.
