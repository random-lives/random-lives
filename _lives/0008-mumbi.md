Mumbi was born near the end of the long rains in 318, in the cool high country near the great mountain. Nights were cold enough to wake you. Grass gave way to thorn and scrub. Her father kept a few cattle and goats and worked small fields with his brothers. Her mother planted, weeded, ground grain, cooked, and brewed beer when there was enough.

She was the sixth child and the last. Two older sisters died within days of birth and were not spoken of after the mourning. One brother died at six when a hard cough moved through the ridge and children stopped breathing in the night. Another sister lived to fifteen and then wasted fast with fever and diarrhea. The oldest brother survived into old age, but even when Mumbi was small he spent most evenings with age-mates away from the hearth.

Twice, while she was still young, the rains failed and the food pits emptied early. The elders met and argued about neglected offerings and who had held back beer at the last communal rite. In her mother’s pot the porridge thinned. Mumbi was sent farther for firewood, beyond the nearest thickets, and came back with scratched legs and a heavier bundle each time. She watched which households still ate well. She remembered.

She grew into a girl who finished what she was told to do. She rose before first light, swept the yard, checked the cooking pots, and went to the fields with a hoe her father kept oiled with animal fat so it would not pit. She was slow to grasp a new instruction. When older women showed her a planting line or a storage trick, she needed to see it again. Being corrected in front of others made her stiff with anger. She did not soften her face to hide it. She learned by watching hands and copying until the work sat in her muscles.

She did not smooth over disputes. When a cousin lifted a beer gourd from her mother’s store without asking, Mumbi blocked the path and demanded it back. He laughed at first, then stopped when she did not move. Her father was pulled aside afterward and questioned by his brothers about why his daughter spoke like a man at the gate. Her mother scolded her under her breath and told her to swallow her words. Mumbi obeyed for a time, and lay awake with her stomach tight and her heart running.

After her age-mates went through a passage rite, marriage talks began with a family on a nearby ridge. Bridewealth was counted in animals and obligations that would be repaid over time. Mumbi left her birth hearth and walked to her husband’s compound carrying gourds and woven bundles. The place looked familiar—thorn fence, smoke, dung, children running underfoot—but nothing belonged to her. She was expected to answer softly, learn fast, and keep her eyes down when elders spoke.

She worked without pause. She did not charm the older women. When they tested her with jokes and small slights, she met them straight on and did not pretend to miss the point. It made her disliked. It also made people careful about taking from her.

She gave birth three times: a daughter, then another daughter, then a son. Women attended her and did what they knew—pressing and guiding, cutting and tying the cord. She held her voice down until the last moment and the older women approved of that. Afterward she kept the children clean and fed and expected them to obey quickly. When her first daughter clung to her skirt, Mumbi pushed her off and made her pick up spilled grain. If neighbors came to borrow a pot or a grinding stone, Mumbi demanded it back on time and counted what had been taken. Her husband argued with her more than once. He wanted easy relations with kin. Mumbi wanted clear edges and fewer surprises.

When livestock sickness came, it showed first in ticks thick on the animals’ ears and under their tails. Cattle rubbed against the posts until their hides broke and flies gathered. Milk fell off and children cried for it. Older men blamed grazing too close to wet ground and argued over who had moved the herd where. Meals shifted to more grain and greens. Mumbi drove her daughters into the fields harder and watched the storage baskets like a hawk.

She accused her husband’s younger brother of taking meat meant for the household and giving it away to his friends. She said it in front of his mother. The younger brother denied it, then stopped denying when she named the day and the cut. The insult was not that she spoke; it was that she spoke in the wrong place. The quarrel dragged on and split work groups. Doors of woven screens were pulled shut when she passed.

Her husband died while she was still young. He took a fever in a season when many were shaking with illness. He sweated through the night, talked to people who were not there, and by the second day he could not sit up. Women brought water. Men consulted elders and made the proper offerings. He died on the second night. The household washed him, wrapped him, and buried him according to their custom.

After that Mumbi’s space in the compound narrowed. She stayed where her children belonged, under the authority of her husband’s lineage. No one arranged a new marriage for her, and she did not ask for one. She did not want another man’s rules on top of the rules she already lived under.

The compound was crowded: brothers, their wives, children, bent-backed elders, and visitors who slept near the fire and left before dawn. Some seasons, long-distance goods filtered in through many hands—salt, a small iron blade, a few beads. Once a short string of blue beads arrived as part of a payment between men. The wives watched it like meat on a platter and argued over who should hold it. Mumbi looked once, then turned back to the grain store. She did not forget the beads. She used them as a measure of what people would fight over.

A brother-in-law fell into a long sickness. It began with fever and ended in weakness that did not lift. His belly swelled. He passed worms and lay in his own filth when no one watched him. People avoided the sleeping place where he lay. The men complained that a man who could not work still ate.

Mumbi took over his care because everyone else kept finding reasons to be elsewhere. She cooked thin porridge and made him swallow it in small mouthfuls. She boiled bitter plants and held the gourd to his lips. She washed him when he soiled himself, her mouth tight with disgust, her hands steady. She weeded his patch of field and checked the small stock he had been responsible for. As the weeks dragged on she grew harsher with everyone.

One woman in the compound said the sickness came from an offense and that someone had tied it to him. Mumbi answered that the filth on the path and the place where children squatted were enough to make a belly turn, and that it did not take a quarrel with a neighbor to bring worms. The older woman slapped her. Mumbi did not strike back. She also did not apologize.

The brother-in-law lived, but he did not return to strength. People praised the plants, the rites, and the ancestors. Mumbi counted the hours she had spent awake and the work she had kept from collapsing. Her standing rose because everyone had watched her do it, and because no one wanted to admit they had left the sick man to her.

In her early thirties another poor season came. The stalks stood thin and the cobs filled poorly. Children begged at the cooking place before the pot was ready. Mumbi rationed hard and refused requests she could not replace. She fought with an in-law over a basket of grain and was told she had no respect and no softness. That night she lay awake listening to coughing in the next sleeping space. Her heart thudded as if she had been running. She pictured her children with hollow cheeks. She pictured being blamed.

The illness that killed her came on slowly. First came a tiredness she could not shake. Standing made her dizzy. Her skin looked washed out under soot and sun. Her belly cramped. She kept working until her legs shook. Then she began to vomit and could not keep food down. Behind the fence she passed stool streaked with blood. Women brought water and gave her the bitter drinks they trusted. The weakness deepened anyway. Crossing the yard left her short of breath. Her heart hammered even when she lay still.

She died in 353, on a mat in the same compound where she had lived as a wife and then as a widow. Smoke from the cooking fire slid along the roof. Outside the fence, goats nosed for scraps.
