#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 30
#     connection: Begins once she is independently trading (late 1980s); small thefts

#     incident: victim_property_crime (recurring pattern)
#   - age: 40
#     connection: Placed in 1998-2000, just after partner's death when she is re-stocking
#       alone; a large portion of stock/takings disappears during a busy market day,
#       pushing her into debt and increasing alcohol use.

#     name: Yaw
#     narrative_role: Youngest; treated as ‘the small one’ long after he is grown. Often
#       torn between respect for Akwele and frustration at her instability; becomes
#       important in her later-life practical support (errands, clinic visits).
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Helps her survive economically through networks and credit-in-kind,
#       but also draws her into social drinking circles and gossip-driven conflict.
#     scene: In markets she loudly calls customers, jokes, mediates disputes between
#       sellers, and quickly builds a web of acquaintances across Ga/Akan speakers;
#       she is energized by crowds and talk.
#     timing: Teens onward, strongest in early/mid adulthood (1970s-1990s)
#     trait: Extraversion (very high, 98th percentile)
#   - consequence: Greater vulnerability to debt spirals after losses; family members
#       become reluctant to lend money.
#     scene: She procrastinates on restocking and record-keeping, borrows and repays
#       late, and sometimes misses early market hours after drinking; stock management
#       is inconsistent.
#     timing: Adulthood, increasingly visible after mid-30s
#     trait: Conscientiousness (low, 33rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Earns trust and small informal support, but can be exploited (people
#       delay repayment; some take advantage during busy selling moments).
#     scene: She shares food with neighbors, avoids escalating fights, and is known
#       for not cheating with measures when sober; she tries to reconcile quarrels within
#       the family compound.
#     timing: Throughout life; especially visible in motherhood years (1980s-1990s)
#     trait: Agreeableness (high, 86th percentile) + Honesty-Humility (high, 79th percentile)
#   - consequence: Increases reliance on alcohol for emotional regulation and contributes
#       to strained relationships when she becomes accusatory under stress.
#     scene: During sickness seasons or money shortages she becomes restless, irritable,
#       and prone to catastrophizing; she repeatedly checks on children and worries
#       aloud about hospital costs.
#     timing: After major losses (1986-1987 child deaths; post-1998 widowhood; post-2003
#       accident)
#     trait: Neuroticism (moderately high, 60th percentile)
#   - consequence: Financial leakage, missed selling days, family conflict, and increased
#       risk exposure (including the transport/road accident period).
#     scene: Starts as evening drinking with peers after market days; shifts to regular
#       use that sometimes affects morning functioning, spending, and conflict; periods
#       of attempted abstinence coincide with church attendance but relapse follows
#       stressors (widowhood, sister’s death, theft, injury).
#     timing: Onset late 20s/early 30s (late 1980s), escalation after 1998; chronic
#       course into older age
#     trait: Alcohol-use disorder (harmful use/dependence)
# number_of_children: '5'
# number_of_siblings: '8'
# occupation: Petty trader/market vendor (foodstuffs, small goods, prepared foods; informal

# structured_incidents:
# - event: 'This was a recurring pattern: over the years selling foodstuffs and small
#     goods in local markets around the Accra–Adenta/Madina corridor, she periodically
#     had cash or a small bag of goods stolen (especially during crowded market days
#     and on transport), and once experienced a more serious loss when part of her stock
#     and the day’s takings disappeared while she was distracted serving customers.'
#   reasoning: Petty traders/market vendors in Greater Accra are routinely exposed to
#     theft, scams, and occasional robbery over a lifetime, especially when handling
#     cash or goods in markets and transport.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Most often ages 25–55, with the most serious single loss around ages 38–42
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: She suffered a serious road/transport-related accident while commuting with
#     goods—hit or knocked down near a busy road while trying to cross with a pan/basin
#     of items—resulting in a leg injury that kept her from trading and walking normally
#     for several weeks and forced her to rely on relatives for help with childcare
#     and income.
#   reasoning: As a lifelong petty trader in Greater Accra, she would spend years walking/commuting
#     with loads, cooking around open fires/kerosene, and navigating traffic and crowded
#     markets; alcohol-use disorder increases risk of falls, burns, and road-related
#     injury, making at least one weeks-long disabling accident fairly plausible.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Around ages 44–47

---

Akwele was born on 2 November 1958 on the Accra plains, in a Ga-speaking family living east of the city where farms, compounds, and roadside kiosks sat close together. Gold Coast rule had ended the year before, and the new Ghanaian state reached even small places through school fees, police posts, and party slogans painted on walls. In her mother’s room, a small framed Bible verse hung above a trunk; Sundays meant church clothes, and at night her mother knelt to pray in Ga before sleep.

Her mother, Afi Lartey, ran a petty trading life from early morning: cassava, smoked fish when she could afford it, tomatoes when they were in season, small packets of salt, matches, and soap. Akwele learned to sit quietly beside a pan of goods and answer questions for her mother in Ga and Twi, her mouth quick and fearless with strangers. Her father, Tetteh Mensah, was a mason and carpenter who came and went with contracts. When he appeared, he brought a bag of cement, a little cash, sometimes a length of cloth for Afi. He did not sleep in the compound. Akwele understood early that adults could belong to you and still not be there.

She was the second of nine children. Kojo, the firstborn, kept his eyes on her as if she might wander into trouble; he was only two years older but already spoke with the tone of a caretaker. Ama came after Akwele, then the brothers and sisters in a long line. An infant brother, Kwame, died in 1962 before Akwele could remember much besides the way her mother’s voice flattened for weeks. The household stayed crowded anyway. Afi’s mother, Naa Dedei Lartey, lived close enough to pull Akwele by the wrist to church, or to send her back with a calabash of soup when there was nothing in Afi’s pot.

Akwele started school but did not stay. She sat in class restless, eager to talk, eager to be outside, and the demands at home came first. When market days were good, Afi kept her with the stall to count coins by touch and memory, not by writing. When the 1966 coup came, Akwele was seven, old enough to notice soldiers on the radio and adults whispering about curfews and the price of rice. Transport became uncertain on some days; Afi sold closer to home and sent the older children to watch the younger ones.

In the early 1970s the compound ran on older siblings’ hands. Kofi, Nii, and the youngest brother Yaw came in quick succession; Esi, the small sister, clung to Akwele’s wrapper when she walked. Akwele carried water, swept, and learned which customers tried to shortchange. She took pride in bargaining, smiling wide, letting the other person think they had won. Naa Dedei died in 1976. Without her, church attendance depended on Afi’s energy and money for offerings. Akwele still liked the singing and the call-and-response; she liked to stand outside afterward and talk, switching between Ga and Twi depending on who had come.

At nineteen she began seeing Kwaku Tetteh, a man from nearby who worked odd jobs and could talk his way into and out of anything. They started living in a marriage-like way in 1978, under the eyes of family and church. He was present more than her father had been, yet he still disappeared for stretches when work pulled him away. Akwele took it as normal.

Her first child, Mansa, arrived in 1979. A son, Kojo, followed in 1981. Those were years of shortages and queue lines; people talked about coups, about money losing value, about items that vanished from shops. Akwele traded anyway. She sold whatever moved fast: onions, gari, small tins, sachets when they appeared, cooked snacks when she had charcoal. She slept lightly and woke before dawn, enjoying the cool hour when the road was quiet and she could joke with other women setting out their pans. Maame Serwaa, an older trader who spoke Twi in a clipped way, taught her to keep a little stock hidden at home and to take credit only from people who feared shame.

In 1984, Akwele had a third child, a boy she called Kwesi. She carried him on her back as she sold, and his head bumped her shoulder when she laughed. He died in 1986, fever turning fast. She returned from the clinic empty-handed and went straight back to the stall two days later because there was no other way to eat. After a stillbirth in 1987, a boy named Kofi who lived only hours, she began drinking more regularly in the evenings, a cup passed around behind the stalls when the day’s heat eased. She said it helped her sleep. It also helped her talk, and she liked talking.

Tetteh Mensah died in 1988. The news came through a relative, and there was no last conversation. Afi cried and then asked practical questions about funeral contributions. Akwele’s life already depended on her own hands, and that did not change. She had her fourth surviving child, Yaw, in 1990. The older children became helpers: Mansa learned to stir and serve, Kojo learned to lift and to watch money.

The 1990s brought more stability in public life, and more competition in the markets. Akwele kept her place by being loud and friendly, calling to customers with jokes, holding up produce so it looked fresher than it was. She attended a mainline church when she could, singing hymns in English she did not read, following along by ear. She prayed at home at night, hands folded, asking for health and school fees. Yet she also began to lose hours to drink. Some days she arrived late, stock half-sorted, irritated when anyone asked questions.

Thefts started as small humiliations. In 1988 a coin purse went missing from her cloth while she was bending to scoop pepper. In 1992 someone took a bag of onions from behind her bench on a crowded day. She argued, shouted, then laughed it off and kept selling. She grew careful, tying cash into the corner of her wrapper, but crowded lorries and busy markets took their share.

Kwaku Tetteh died in 1998. The funeral costs hit hard, and after the burial the household had no second adult income at all. That year, in September, a serious theft cut deeper than the rest. During a rush of customers she turned to measure rice, and when she looked down the day’s takings and part of her stock were gone. She walked the market asking questions, anger rising into her throat. No one gave it back. She borrowed to restock and began paying the loan in small painful pieces.

Efua, another trader, became her evening companion. They sat behind a kiosk with sachets of gin, sharing roasted groundnuts, laughing at rumors and teasing men who tried to flirt too hard. Akwele could be generous, buying a drink for someone short of coins, and then furious the next day when that same person “forgot” to repay her. Her sister Ama helped with childcare when Akwele ran errands or when drinking left her slow in the morning, and the two women fought about money in the open, then cooled off and shared kenkey the next day.

In 2003, carrying goods in a basin and trying to cross a busy road on the Accra–Adenta side, Akwele was knocked down by a vehicle edging through traffic. Her leg took the impact. She spent weeks unable to walk properly. She lay on a mat, sweating in the heat, snapping at children who moved too loudly. Mansa cooked and sold small things in her place. The younger son Yaw, now a teenager, fetched water and stood in lorry stations with a look that dared people to cheat. Akwele’s drinking returned as soon as she could sit up, partly from pain, partly from the shame of dependence.

Adjoa, her younger sister, died in 2004 at thirty-four. The funeral drained what little Akwele had rebuilt. Afterward she stayed away from church for a while, skipping Sundays, sleeping late, then appearing in the afternoon with sunglasses and excuses. Her eldest brother Kojo scolded her with patience at first and then with fatigue.

Years passed with small cycles: good weeks when she bought a whole sack of goods and sold it clean, bad weeks when a customer disappeared with credit, days when she woke determined not to drink and then joined Efua by dusk. During the COVID-19 period she sold less, crowded markets thinning and rules changing, and she leaned more heavily on her children. In 2023 her brother Kojo died at sixty-seven. She attended the funeral in black cloth, talking to relatives, laughing sharply at a cousin’s joke, then going quiet when the hymns began.

Late in 2025 Akwele lives in the same Greater Accra area where she was born. Her stall is smaller now: more sachet water and small goods, less heavy stock. She sits in the late afternoon where she can see the road, calling greetings in Ga, then answering in Twi when needed. Some evenings she goes to church and sings. On other evenings she sits with a cup in her hand, while her youngest son checks that she has eaten.
