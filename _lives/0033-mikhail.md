#     timing: Adolescence through middle adulthood (late 1870s–1900s)
#     trait: Openness (97th percentile) - very high
#   - consequence: Chronic conflict with neighbors/relatives; strains marriage; reduces
#       ability to rely on informal mutual aid except from closest kin.
#     scene: Frequent cutting remarks, quick escalation in disputes over shared-space
#       rules (stove time, noise, debts), and refusal to offer conciliatory apologies;

#     timing: All phases, strongest in married adult life (1886–1912)
#     trait: Agreeableness (4th percentile) - very low
#   - consequence: Higher vulnerability to layoffs and arrears; contributes to the 1900–1902
#       crisis and keeps the household in shared housing.
#     scene: Missed shifts after late nights or after quarrels; paperwork and savings

#     scene: Prone to cynical justifications ('they cheat us first') and occasional
#       corner-cutting at work (taking small materials, time theft) while still avoiding
#       outright criminal identity.
#     timing: Adulthood (1890s–1900s)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (27th percentile) - low
#   - consequence: Slightly better job stability than the least-skilled laborers, and
#       greater exposure to new ideas—feeding openness and anticlerical drift.
#     scene: Learns machine routines quickly, remembers instructions, and can summarize
#       printed arguments despite limited writing ability; becomes the person others
#       ask to interpret a posted notice.
#     timing: Young adulthood onward (1880s–1900s)
#     trait: Intelligence (71st percentile) - above average
#   - consequence: Life problems emerge mainly through conflict and instability rather
#       than through acute psychiatric breakdown.
#     scene: Shows enduring abrasiveness and stubbornness without clear episodes of

Mikhail Alekseyevich was born on January 11, 1862 in Davydkovo on the western edge of Moscow province, in the Russian Empire under Alexander II. His family were Great Russians, spoke Russian at home, and lived by Orthodox rhythms: an icon corner with a lamp, crossing themselves before eating, and the long singsong of Church Slavonic heard in church on feast days.

His father, Aleksey, worked for wages in a factory and came home with soot on his sleeves and the smell of oil in his hair. His mother, Darya, kept the stove going, patched clothing, salted cabbage, and watched the children. Mikhail was the third of five. Ivan, born in 1858, took on the authority of an eldest even when he was still a boy; he grabbed Mikhail’s collar when he got bold and told him to shut his mouth in front of adults. Petr, born in 1860, stayed closer to Mikhail in everything—games, chores, and later in the city the same streets and the same kind of work. Anna followed in 1864, quick to cry and quick to laugh; she clung to their mother and took offense at Mikhail’s mocking. Sergey came in 1866 and grew up watching the older boys test each other and then deny they cared.

The family called themselves peasants because that was their estate, but the household ran on cash. After the emancipation, the adults talked about payments and papers, and how much land counted for less than steady wages near Moscow. Aleksey expected obedience and speed. Mikhail learned early that a sharp answer could land him a slap, and he gave sharp answers anyway. When Ivan tried to bully him away from a crust of bread, Mikhail spat a curse and fought for it with his hands. Darya broke them apart and then made each boy kiss the icon and say he was sorry. Mikhail did it fast, eyes sideways, already angry at being forced.

At nine he spent a winter in a parish schoolroom long enough to sound out letters and read a simple prayer book. He could follow the familiar lines of “Otche nash” and “Bogoroditse Devo” and he learned to recognize common words on shop signs. Writing never came easily; he held the pen stiff and his letters came out uneven, but he could sign his name when he needed to. He liked listening more than copying. At home he asked questions that irritated his father—how a loom worked, why foremen could fine men for being late, why some workers wore good boots and others wrapped rags around their feet. Aleksey told him to stop talking and bring water.

As a teenager Mikhail began spending more time in Moscow. Davydkovo was still village ground, but the city pressed close, pulling boys into errands and then into work. Petr went with him and they shared a room with other workers, sleeping on benches when they had to. Mikhail kept to himself until someone gave him a reason not to. He could sit quiet through a noisy evening and then turn on one man with a cutting remark that started a shouting match. He did not like being laughed at. He did like laughing at others, especially at pompous talk.

In 1882 he took a regular place in a factory. The work was hard on the hands and lungs. He learned quickly where to stand, how to shift his weight, how to watch the moving parts without staring. The foreman, Vasily Kuznetsov, watched for men who tried to slow the pace. Mikhail’s speed kept him employed, but his mouth got him fines. When a posted notice went up, he read it aloud to the men who couldn’t. He did it with extra emphasis on the rules and penalties, then added his own comments, loud enough to be heard. Vasily told him once to remember where he stood in the world. Mikhail told him he stood where the dust was thickest. He lost a week’s worth of pay in penalties after that.

In 1886 he married Elena, a woman from the same peasant-worker world. Their wedding went through the Orthodox church—crowns, candles, and the priest’s voice. Elena set an icon corner in their room and kept it even when they moved into tighter places. For a while Mikhail followed her lead. He crossed himself before meals and went to church on major feasts.

Their first son, Aleksey, was born in 1887 and died within days. The priest, Father Ioann, came for the rites, and Mikhail stood still and listened, face stiff. Two years later another boy arrived, Pavel, and he also died as an infant. Elena cried behind a scarf; Mikhail snapped at neighbors who came to offer comfort and then mocked the words they used. He still went to church when he was expected to, and he still lit candles when Elena pressed coins into his hand.

In 1892 their third son, Nikolay, lived long enough to become a child in the room. He reached for his father’s hands when Mikhail came home, and he learned to imitate the sign of the cross, small fingers clumsy. That same year cholera and other sickness moved through Moscow again; the city filled with disinfection crews, warnings, and fear of dirty water. Nikolay fell ill and did not recover. Elena sat by him and kept the icon lamp lit. Mikhail argued with Father Ioann in the doorway after the death, demanding plain answers. The priest spoke of God’s will and the need for humility. Mikhail told him to keep his words for people who had sons to spare.

After that he stopped praying. He kept the icon corner because Elena kept it, and because the neighbors noticed everything in a shared apartment. The crossing of himself before eating became quick and empty, then disappeared. He stopped fasting in Lent and ate what was in front of him. When Anna visited and urged him to come for confession, he laughed and asked what confession would buy him. He began spending more evenings with a neighbor, Yegor Sidorov, in the shared kitchen, talking over cheap tea and black bread. Yegor brought pamphlets and newspapers. Mikhail read what he could and asked Yegor to explain the rest. He liked talk about inventions and foreign places, and he liked arguments even more. He enjoyed irritating Elena by quoting lines about priests and landlords while she kneaded dough.

A fourth son, Stepan, was born in 1896 and died soon after. Mikhail stayed away from the church that time until the necessary papers were done. Elena blamed herself and then blamed him for his bitterness. They remained married and lived together, but the room went quieter between them.

By the late 1890s they lived in a multi-family shared apartment arrangement, walls thin, the stove contested. Marfa Petrovna, an older woman in the flat, kept track of whose turn it was to cook and how much noise was made at night. Mikhail hated being told what to do by someone who didn’t pay his wages. He argued over the stove, over a missing spoon, over a bucket left in the wrong place. Elena apologized to neighbors when he refused.

The hardest stretch came in 1900. Reduced shifts hit the factory and men were turned away at the gate. Mikhail waited with the others, fists in his pockets, and then walked home furious with nothing in his hands. Rent fell into arrears. He carried their bedding and some clothing to a pawnshop, then returned and told Elena it was her fault for wanting decent things. He took irregular day work—hauling, unloading, anything that paid that evening. Ivan and Petr each lent a little money once, and each time Mikhail took it with a sharp joke that made Petr’s face close. Elena stretched soup with more water and saved crumbs for morning. The crisis lasted into 1902. They kept their place only by squeezing tighter, taking in another family corner, and tolerating constant tension.

When unrest spread through the city in 1905, Mikhail paid attention. He did not join a party, but he listened, read posted notices, and argued loudly about wages and punishments. He learned to watch the police as he talked. After the uprisings and the crackdown, the city felt watched. Men disappeared for questioning. Mikhail kept his head down at the factory and saved his loudest words for the kitchen, where he could pretend they were only talk.

Anna died in 1904, leaving behind a gap that could not be filled by argument. Darya died in 1908. Mikhail attended the funeral and stood through the prayers without joining in. Afterward he ate the memorial meal, took a second helping without asking, and then told Petr he was tired of pretending for dead people.

In 1911 pain began to hold him back from work. He still went as long as he could, proud of not missing a shift, then he stopped. The illness was cancer, and it progressed quickly. Elena kept him in their crowded rooms, and neighbors complained about the smell and the coughing and the space taken. Petr visited and brought broth; Ivan came once, grayer, and told Mikhail he should have been kinder to people. Mikhail answered with a short laugh and turned his face away.

He died on March 2, 1912 at fifty. Elena arranged an Orthodox burial: the body washed, dressed, and taken to church, candles lit at the service, then lowered into the ground in a city cemetery while the priest read the final prayers.
