He was born on February 20, 389, in a hamlet on the flat wet ground near the middle Yangtze in what is now Hubei, under the Eastern Jin. His family were Han tenants tied to the estate of a powerful household, and his father, Liang Qiu, carried the landlord’s authority in the fields: he counted bundles at harvest, watched the storehouse, and kept order when men argued over water and boundaries. At home Liang Qiu spoke the local Sinitic tongue, and he traded short phrases in a neighboring hill people’s language when he dealt with carriers and charcoal burners.

Liang Qiu’s wife, Wen, worked the way the season demanded. She spent winter days twisting hemp fiber and mending, then moved into the paddies at planting time to set seedlings in straight lines. Their two sons already filled the yard. The eldest, Liang Ren, was five and followed his father, lifting small tools and imitating his stance. The second, Liang Zhi, was three and stayed close to Wen as she cooked millet gruel and watched the fire.

On the day of the birth, women from nearby houses came to help. The child came hard and fast. He did not cry strongly afterward, and Wen bled and shook. For seven days he lay wrapped near the hearth while Wen was fed thin broth and salt. On February 27, 389, he died from the injury of the birth.
