#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Fewer allies in disputes and less informal support during the debt
#       crisis; marriage remains functional but emotionally sparse.
#     scene: At festivals/market days he hangs at the edge, speaks only when necessary,
#       and prefers solitary tasks (watching irrigation turns, mending a plough beam)
#       rather than communal drinking or gossip.
#     timing: especially ages 10–35
#     trait: Very low extraversion (3rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Worsens yields and raises conflict with father/brothers; increases
#       reliance on brother Dharma to keep accounts and schedules.
#     scene: He delays repairing bunds and misses an agreed irrigation turn; he knows
#       what must be done but puts it off, then scrambles, blaming himself afterward.
#     timing: ages 12–33, most visible during 530–533
#     trait: Very low conscientiousness (4th percentile)
#   - consequence: Chronic worry, irritability, sleep disruption; reinforces depressive
#       spiral under stress.
#     scene: After hearing of fever in a neighboring hamlet he catastrophizes about
#       his son’s health, checks him repeatedly at night, and interprets ordinary coughs
#       as omens.
#     timing: ages 20–35
#     trait: Very high neuroticism (89th percentile)
#   - consequence: Occasional practical wins (avoiding being cheated, advising on planting),
#       but frustration when he cannot sustain follow-through due to low conscientiousness/depression.
#     scene: He quickly learns to estimate grain measures, spot unfair weights at the
#       market, and mentally track debts/interest even if he fails to record them; he
#       also notices patterns in rainfall timing and argues for changing sowing dates.
#     timing: ages 14–31
#     trait: Very high intelligence (98th percentile)
#   - consequence: Reduced farm productivity and social participation; family members
#       compensate; emotional distance from son despite underlying attachment.
#     scene: Following mounting debts—and later after his wife’s death—he shows persistent
#       low mood, slowed movement, long periods sitting silent, reduced appetite, and
#       a sense of worthlessness ('I spoil whatever I touch').
#     timing: mild/chronic from late teens; markedly worse ages 28–35; acute worsening
#       after 533
#     trait: Depressive disorder (primary impairment)

#     part of their holding, forcing him to work more days on others’ fields while trying
#     to keep his own plot going.'
#   reasoning: Even middling smallholders were vulnerable to bad monsoons, illness,
#     and debt cycles; widowhood could also destabilize the household economy. However,

Hari was born in August 502 in a farming settlement on the upper Gangetic plain, where local magnates collected dues in grain and labor in the name of distant Gupta authority. The household spoke an Indo‑Aryan village vernacular. They kept Jain vows as laypeople: careful about harming creatures, strict on certain fast days, and generous to wandering teachers when they came through.

His father, Vasudeva, held a small plot with rights that were never fully secure. His mother, Gaurī, ran the hearth and stores and set the rhythm of the day: sweeping the packed floor, grinding grain on a stone quern, and keeping the water pots filled from the nearest well. Hari’s paternal grandparents lived under the same roof when he was small. Bhadra, his grandfather, supervised the fields and told Hari where boundary stones sat and which trees marked the line with the next hamlet. Sūryā kept the grain jars and watched the cooking fires, and she pressed Hari to wash, to eat, to sit still when he shook with worry for no clear reason.

Two younger siblings came and went fast. Padmā, born in 504, died before she learned to sit. Soma arrived in 508 and did not last the rains. The women washed the infants and wrapped them; the men carried them out beyond the houses. After each death, Gaurī added small changes: more smoke on damp evenings, a tighter watch on a cough, a clay lamp set nearer the household shrine. The shrine held a small image kept clean of soot, a shallow dish for rice and flowers, and a wick lamp. On fast days the adults ate once or not at all, sipping water sparingly. Hari learned early to cup insects out of the house rather than slap them.

He grew into a quiet boy who avoided the loud edge of the village. Other children ran in groups down the paths; Hari followed later, alone, and turned back early. He liked dawn in the cold season when fog sat low and the cattle breathed in the byre. He could count quickly, faster than his cousins, and he remembered what measures of seed went into which strip of soil. Yet he delayed. Bhadra sent him to mend a bund and found him staring at the water line instead of packing the earth. When scolded, Hari went silent and worked in a rush, hands shaking, then spent the evening sullen and restless.

News came from travelers and from the headman’s assistant, Nandī: trouble far to the northwest, raids and armies moving, new demands and new officers. The village did not empty out, but men talked with their heads close together, and strangers on the road were watched harder. Hari’s father began setting aside a little more grain in good years and argued more often with neighbors over boundaries.

When Hari was sixteen, Bhadra died after a short illness in 518. Vasudeva became the unquestioned elder in the house, and the weight of daily tasks shifted. Hari took on more field work. He did the plowing behind the oxen and measured out seed with a quick hand. He also missed things that mattered. A gate left unlatched. A tool not brought in before rain. An irrigation turn forgotten until the water had already been diverted.

Between the ages of eighteen and nineteen, Hari learned to recognize letters and short words. Jinadāsa, a Jain lay teacher who recited and taught in exchange for food, stayed in a nearby settlement during the cool season of 520. Hari sat at the edge of the gathering while others asked questions. Jinadāsa showed a palm-leaf fragment and a wooden tablet, and Hari caught on fast to the shapes. He could not write a steady line for long, but he learned enough to pick out a name and to recognize common words for measures and debts. He used the skill later to check markings and to avoid being cheated by weights at the market.

Vasudeva arranged Hari’s marriage in 521 with Anantī, the daughter of another cultivating family. She moved into the joint household and took her place beside Gaurī and Sūryā at the hearth. Hari treated her with correctness more than warmth. He spoke little at meals, ate quickly, and went out before others finished. He preferred solitary tasks: watching the field edges for cattle, clearing small weeds along the bunds, sitting under a neem at midday with a lump of cold millet bread and a smear of sour curd. He had a habit of rubbing his thumb against his finger when he worried, and he did it often.

Sūryā died in 523. After her funeral rites, the house felt less ordered. Gaurī stayed steady, but she had more work, and Anantī’s hands were pulled in several directions at once. Hari’s brothers grew up beneath him. Dharma, born in 506, took quickly to bargaining and village talk. He teased Hari for his silence, not cruelly, but with the easy confidence Hari never had. Deva, the youngest, born in 512, followed Hari into the fields and copied his movements. Deva could make Hari laugh on rare afternoons by repeating the village headman’s pompous phrases in an exaggerated voice.

Hari’s son, Dharadatta, was born in 526. Hari watched the infant’s breathing too closely and woke at small sounds. He hovered near the women, then pulled himself away and worked until his back ached. When neighbors’ children fell ill, Hari kept Dharadatta indoors and snapped when others mocked his caution.

The region stayed unsettled. Even when the distant fighting ebbed, local power pressed close. Nandī came more often with demands: extra labor days to repair a track, extra grain for officials passing through, a recalculation of what a plot owed. Dharma handled these encounters better. Hari stood behind him, tense, remembering each word and later replaying it in his mind, angry at himself for not speaking.

A weak monsoon in 530 brought thin stalks and a light harvest. The next year did not bring recovery. Vasudeva borrowed grain from Kṣemaka, a moneylender who also traded in seed and kept a storehouse near the market. Hari understood the numbers and the trap in them, but he could not make himself do the daily, careful work that might have protected them. He postponed mending a bund; a section broke in a rain and a corner of their field lost water at the wrong time. He forgot an irrigation agreement and arrived late, arguing with a neighbor while the channel ran on. The household fell behind on dues. Kṣemaka took pledged items—metal implements and a bit of jewelry from the women—and in 532 accepted a temporary mortgage on part of the holding.

That same year Vasudeva died. The house did not split; the brothers kept their joint arrangement, sharing work and stores. Dharma became the voice in disputes and the one who met Nandī and Kṣemaka. Hari did more days working on others’ fields for grain, returning dusty and quiet. He ate less and slept at odd hours. When spoken to, he answered slowly, as if pulling words up from deep. Anantī pressed him to eat and to bathe, and he turned away, irritated and ashamed.

In 533 Anantī died after a short sickness that left her weak and hot, then gone. Gaurī and Mallā—Dharma’s wife—took over most of the household’s daily work and pulled Dharadatta into their orbit. Hari stayed in the fields longer than he needed to, sitting alone at the edge of the plot until light faded. He stopped attending gatherings when Jinadāsa or other Jain reciters visited. On fast days he fasted harshly, then grew dizzy and irritable, and Mallā began quietly putting a cup of thin gruel beside him without comment.

By 534 the family contained the worst of the debt. Dharma renegotiated terms and found seasonal work that brought in extra grain. Hari never regained ease. He loved his son in small acts—fixing a sandal strap, teaching him to count seeds into his palm, pointing out letter shapes on a merchant’s tally—but he rarely played, and his face stayed tight. He avoided the market unless forced. Loud talk annoyed him; he flinched at sudden laughter.

In early May 538, at the end of the cool season’s last edge, Hari caught a hard cough that turned to chest pain and fast breathing. He stayed in the house while Mallā boiled herbs and Gaurī warmed water. Dharma went to fetch a healer who pressed oil and gave a bitter decoction. Hari could not rise for long. He died on May 9.

The men of the joint household carried his body to the cremation place outside the settlement. They burned it on a wood pyre, then gathered the remains and placed them near running water; Gaurī set a small lamp and a handful of uncooked rice at the household shrine that night.
