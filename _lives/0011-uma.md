Uma was born on August 16, 873, in a mud-walled house at the edge of a village south of the Kaimur hills. Her family had no fields of their own. Before sunrise her father took his sickle and rope and went to the headman’s land with the other laborers. The steward counted out grain when the day’s work was done and kept a note of what was owed.

Her mother kept the fire going and did whatever brought a little food into the house: husking rice and millet, grinding, and spinning when her hands were free. She wedged the spindle against her arm and worked it while she sat, rocking the baby with her foot. The household was patrilocal and crowded. Uma’s father’s parents ate from the same pot. Her grandmother watched the stores and scolded over salt and fuel. Her grandfather sat near the doorway, slow with a bad knee, giving orders that no one followed quickly.

They named the child Uma. At dawn her mother set a small lamp by the wall and placed a few grains of rice beside it, asking for protection. Once, when the baby’s skin broke out in heat rash, her grandmother brought a brahmin to speak a short blessing. He took a handful of grain and left. After that they relied on what they could do at home: smoke from the hearth, oil on the skin, ash marks on the threshold.

In the monsoon of 874 the low ground stayed wet. The well water turned cloudy and the path to it became a strip of mud churned by feet. When the queue grew long and tempers rose, Uma’s mother filled the pot from a shallow pool near the fields where runoff gathered. The water looked clear in the morning. It carried the taste of rot.

Uma began to pass thin stools. Her mother kept offering the breast, and the baby sucked once or twice and turned away. Her grandmother boiled rice until it broke and poured off the starchy water, mixing in salt. Uma swallowed a little and then brought it back up. The stools kept coming. Her mouth dried and her crying weakened into a strained rasp.

By the last week of April 875 her eyes stayed half open and her skin burned under the touch. Her mother held her through the afternoon, lifting her head again and again, trying to get her to take milk. On May 1, while the men were out in the fields, Uma went limp in her mother’s lap. Her body cooled quickly, and the house fell quiet except for the scrape of the grinding stone in the next room.
