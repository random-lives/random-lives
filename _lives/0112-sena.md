#   and trapping'
# household_social_status: Above average status (well-regarded hunters/providers; strong
#   kin/alliance network; some influence in group decisions)
# household_structure_at_birth: Polygynous household (father with two wives and their

#   trips; childcare shared with co-wife/kin)
# narrative_plan:
#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: -4889
#     name: Rasa
#     narrative_role: Mixed hunter-fisher-trapper and respected provider; one of the
#       men who could coordinate fishing sites and seasonal moves. Warm but demanding;
#       pushes Sena to learn routes and reading of water/animal sign. Dies when Sena
#       is ~32, worsening the household’s vulnerability during the displacement crisis.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: -4876
#     name: Sali
#     narrative_role: 'Mobile forager; joins longer trips while co-wife/kin mind small
#       children. Affectionate but high-strung after losing Mina; teaches Sena edible
#       plants and cautions about strangers. Relationship: close, with Sena absorbing
#       her vigilance. Dies when Sena is ~45, after years of stress and repeated flight.'
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: -4870
#     name: Rima
#     narrative_role: Co-wife who shares childcare and food-processing; practical and
#       socially savvy. Provides an alternative model of calm competence; later takes
#       in children after Taro’s death, driving caregiving burdens in the kin cluster.
#     role: father's second wife (co-wife of mother)
#   - death_year: -4898
#     name: Naro
#     narrative_role: Mother’s brother; prominent during Sena’s early childhood as a
#       storyteller and route-knower. His death reduces Sena’s maternal-side protection
#       and is one of Sena’s first clear experiences of adult loss.
#     role: maternal uncle (frequent early caretaker/mentor)

#   - birth_year: -4892
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: -4892
#     name: Mina (named in memory of the lost sister)
#     narrative_role: Infant daughter who dies soon after birth; a grief point that
#       makes Sena more protective and more anxious about omens and strangers.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -4889
#     death_age: 62
#     death_year: -4827
#     name: Kanu
#     narrative_role: 'Eldest surviving son; capable fisherman and later a camp organizer.
#       Relationship: respectful but strained by Sena’s long absences; in later years
#       Kanu offers occasional support yet Sena ultimately dies in collateral-kin household
#       rather than Kanu’s.'
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: -4886
#     death_age: 34
#     death_year: -4852
#     name: Toku
#     narrative_role: Second surviving son; restless and quick to join risky ventures.
#       Close to Sena in temperament for mobility; dies young (accident/raid illness),
#       becoming a key caregiving trigger for Sena (helping Toku’s dependents/kin obligations).
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: -4883
#     death_age: 67
#     death_year: -4816
#     name: Gama
#     narrative_role: 'Third surviving son; steadier and more embedded in one territory.
#       Relationship: cordial but distant; Gama becomes part of the broader kin network
#       but not Sena’s daily household late in life.'
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: -4880
#     death_age: 23
#     death_year: -4857
#     name: Saku
#     narrative_role: Youngest child; bright and socially skilled, often mediating tensions
#       between camps. Dies in early adulthood (likely infection/complications), adding
#       to Sena’s later-life caregiving and grief load.
#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 23
#     connection: Triggered by escalating disputes over fishing places and prior killings;
#       Taro pushes for retaliation, Kama insists on caution, and Sena is used as a
#       scout because he is observant and not rash.
#     incident: military_service
#   - age: 24
#     connection: Seasonal continuation; night watches and tracking along foothill routes
#       deepen Sena’s knowledge of passes and safe water sources.
#     incident: military_service
#   - age: 26
#     connection: Last notable raid season before a temporary lull; contributes to later
#       camp reputation but does not translate into high standing due to his quiet manner.
#     incident: military_service
#   - age: 27
#     connection: Occurs during lean travel between territories; connects to later fear
#       of accusations and to the age-40 assault when he is accused of theft at a fishing
#       place.
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   - age: 31
#     connection: Begins after hostile group drives them from a river stretch; worsens
#       after cached gear is lost; father Rasa still alive and helps organize survival.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 32
#     connection: Continues through the next wet/dry transition; ends when allies allow
#       temporary use of a side stream and they rebuild nets and traps.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 30
#     connection: Start of intensified raiding period; repeated night flights and destroyed
#       drying racks set the stage for the later economic crisis.
#     incident: civilian_war_exposure
#   - age: 33
#     connection: Ongoing displacement; Sena is frequently separated on scouting/foraging,
#       raising vulnerability.
#     incident: civilian_war_exposure
#   - age: 34
#     connection: Directly tied to displacement and separation from kin group; afterwards
#       he avoids solitary travel but is forced into it again by subsistence needs.
#     incident: sexual_violence
#   - age: 35
#     connection: Tapers as alliances stabilize; the experience leaves Sena wary, contributing
#       to serial unions and preference for collateral-kin households later.
#     incident: civilian_war_exposure
#   - age: 40
#     connection: Happens at a shared fishing place amid accusations of theft/poaching;
#       resonates with his earlier theft at 27 and his low honesty-humility (opportunism)
#       clashing with high agreeableness (desire to smooth conflict).
#     incident: physical_assault
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-7
#     key_events:
#     - Born into an above-average-status polygynous household in the western upland/river
#       corridor; learns early that camps shift and alliances matter.
#     - Mother and co-wife take him on longer foraging trips; he learns edible plants,
#       water safety, and listening for strangers.
#     - 'First strong memory of loss: maternal uncle Naro dies (around age 23? no—when
#       Sena is ~?); placed at age 23? Correction: Naro dies when Sena is ~23? Adjusted
#       below in incident placements and caretakers; childhood event instead: Mina’s
#       absence and adult talk of her death shapes household mood.'
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 8-17
#     key_events:
#     - Apprenticeship into fishing and trapping; follows father and brothers along
#       trap lines and seasonal streams.
#     - 'Increasing intergroup tension: elders teach avoidance routes and night movement;
#       Sena becomes a careful watcher rather than a bold talker.'
#     - Early bonding with Danu through shared practical tasks; Taro’s bravado both
#       impresses and frightens him.
#     phase: Later childhood / adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-30
#     key_events:
#     - 'Forms first pair-bond with Kori (~age 17-18) and begins regular adult provisioning;
#       reputation: competent tracker, quiet, cooperative.'
#     - Participates in episodic war-party activity as scout/tracker during retaliatory
#       raids and defensive watches (ages 23-26).
#     - Commits a one-time theft of dried fish and stone points while traveling in a
#       lean season (age 27), then carries persistent guilt/fear of retaliation.
#     phase: Young adulthood
#   - age_range: 31-45
#     key_events:
#     - Displacement and loss of cached gear after being driven off a favored river
#       stretch; weeks of near-starvation and improvisation (ages 31-32).
#     - Sexual assault during a separated multi-day foraging trip (age 34), followed
#       by withdrawal, hypervigilance, and increased reluctance to travel alone—yet
#       he keeps moving.
#     - Beaten in a dispute at a shared fishing place (age 40), suffering broken tooth
#       and rib bruising; accelerates fragmentation of his partnership with Lapa and
#       strengthens reliance on brothers/kin.
#     phase: Prime adulthood under conflict and mobility
#   - age_range: 46-60
#     key_events:
#     - 'Caregiving intensifies: helps support kin after Taro’s death (age 43) and later
#       after deaths of his mother (age 45) and daughter Saku (age 23).'
#     - Lives more often in an extended-kin household centered on siblings/nieces/nephews
#       rather than a spouse; contributes knowledge, net-mending, trap-setting, and
#       advice.
#     - Dies at 60 from an acute infectious illness (pneumonia-like fever), cared for
#       by collateral kin.
#     phase: Later adulthood / old age
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Palo
#     prominence: Prominent around ages 27-40; tied to theft rumors and the age-40 assault.
#     relationship: Rival fisher from a neighboring allied camp; later an accuser in
#       the fishing-place dispute
#   - name: Reno
#     prominence: Prominent ages 23-26 during episodic raiding; values Sena as a tracker.
#     relationship: War-party leader from an allied camp (informal raid organizer)
#   - name: Balo
#     prominence: Prominent ages 44-60; part of the extended-kin household that cares
#       for Sena at death.
#     relationship: Niece/nephew figure (child of Taro) who later becomes one of Sena’s
#       close household companions in old age
#   - name: Kori’s brother (unnamed, 'Kori-kin')
#     prominence: Prominent ages 24-35; increases social tension around Sena’s movements.
#     relationship: Affinal kin who resents Sena after separation and later spreads
#       suspicion during conflict
#   partners:
#   - name: Kori
#     narrative_role: First long pair-bond formed soon after initiation into adult hunting/fishing.
#       Initially cooperative, but breaks under travel strain and jealousy during the
#       raiding years; separation sets the pattern for later serial unions.
#     relationship_end_year: -4896
#     relationship_start_year: -4904
#   - name: Binu
#     narrative_role: Second partner during his more mobile phase; she often stays with
#       her natal kin while he ranges. Their relationship is affectionate but unstable;
#       their infant daughter dies, deepening distance and grief.
#     relationship_end_year: -4887
#     relationship_start_year: -4894
#   - name: Tima
#     narrative_role: Third partner; bond formed during frequent displacements. Pragmatic
#       partnership for survival that fades once camps stabilize; ends without dramatic
#       conflict, reinforcing Sena’s drift between territories.
#     relationship_end_year: -4883
#     relationship_start_year: -4887
#   - name: Lapa
#     narrative_role: Later partner after the worst displacement years; strong-willed
#       and expects consistent provisioning. Conflict grows as Sena keeps leaving on
#       long trips; the union ends after repeated absences and a serious dispute over
#       access to fishing places.
#     relationship_end_year: -4877
#     relationship_start_year: -4882
#   - name: Hanu
#     narrative_role: Final significant union; more companionate, with Sena spending
#       more time in kin camps. Ends as Hanu re-joins her own kin network; after this
#       Sena largely resides with siblings/nieces/nephews.
#     relationship_end_year: -4869
#     relationship_start_year: -4875
#   siblings:
#   - birth_year: -4930
#     death_age: 68
#     death_year: -4862
#     name: Kama
#     narrative_role: 'Oldest brother; a steady, widely known provider who becomes Sena’s
#       anchor when camps split. In old age he is the senior male voice in the kin cluster
#       Sena dies among; relationship: protective but sometimes controlling.'
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: -4928
#     death_age: 43
#     death_year: -4885
#     name: Taro
#     narrative_role: Second brother; quick-tempered and risk-taking, often drawn into
#       raids and disputes. He models both courage and recklessness for Sena; dies midlife
#       (illness or raid wounds), leaving dependents that strain the wider kin group.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: -4926
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: -4926
#     name: Mina
#     narrative_role: Older sister who dies at or soon after birth; remembered through
#       mother’s stories and small mention at later mourning rituals, shaping Sena’s
#       mother’s anxiety and protective behavior.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -4924
#     death_age: 58
#     death_year: -4866
#     name: Danu
#     narrative_role: Third brother; competent fisher and trap-maker with a cautious
#       style. He and Sena share practical knowledge and travel together in early adulthood;
#       later they drift apart as Sena becomes more mobile.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: He is valued as a scout/provider but rarely becomes a formal spokesperson;
#       contributes to only average adult standing despite competence.
#     scene: In council circles before a raid or when negotiating fishing access, Sena
#       hangs back, speaks briefly, and prefers to demonstrate knowledge by quietly
#       pointing out tracks and water levels rather than arguing.
#     timing: Adolescence through adulthood (especially ages 18-45)
#     trait: Low extraversion (29th percentile)
#   - consequence: Increases strain on partnerships and encourages serial unions; pushes
#       him toward living with collateral kin for perceived safety.
#     scene: After night flights and later after the sexual assault, he startles at
#       sounds, insists on checking paths twice, and sleeps lightly; he also becomes
#       preoccupied with whether others suspect him of wrongdoing.
#     timing: Conflict/mobility phase (ages 30-45) with echoes into old age
#     trait: High neuroticism (72nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Maintains access to allies during displacement, but can also make
#       him vulnerable to being exploited or scapegoated (links to being accused during
#       the age-40 assault).
#     scene: He regularly gives away a larger share of fish to households with small
#       children and tries to broker peace after disputes, even when he is personally
#       angry.
#     timing: Young adulthood onward
#     trait: High agreeableness (72nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Seeds reputational suspicion that later fuels conflict at shared
#       fishing places; contributes indirectly to the age-40 beating.
#     scene: During scarcity he rationalizes taking food/gear from another camp’s rack
#       and later minimizes it when questioned, framing it as 'borrowing' rather than
#       theft.
#     timing: Young adulthood (age 27) and recurring internal conflict afterward
#     trait: Low honesty-humility (30th percentile)
#   - consequence: Helps him survive displacement and remain useful in old age, making
#       kin more willing to house and care for him during illness.
#     scene: He plans trap lines with redundancy, remembers distant water sources, and
#       improves net placement by noticing seasonal flow shifts; he keeps gear maintained
#       and teaches nephews step-by-step.
#     timing: Throughout adult life, especially ages 18-60
#     trait: Higher intelligence (79th percentile) + moderately high conscientiousness
#       (61st percentile)
# number_of_children: '5'
# number_of_siblings: '4'
# occupation: Hunter-fisher-trapper (mixed subsistence male role; hunting combined with
#   significant fishing/riverine trapping)
# religion: Everyday animist spirit-propitiation (forest/river/mountain place-spirits),
#   with small offerings and spoken requests before hunts/travel and after kills

# - M
# structured_incidents:
# - event: During a lean season while traveling between territories, he quietly took
#     a bundle of dried fish and a couple of stone points from another camp’s hanging
#     rack near the riverbank, intending to replace them later but never doing so.
#   reasoning: Taking food or valuables from outsiders/other camps, opportunistic appropriation,
#     or boundary 'poaching' of resources were plausible in a mobile life; low honesty-humility
#     slightly increases risk.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Single event; age 27
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime
# - event: After being driven out of a favored stretch of river by a hostile group and
#     losing cached gear in the flight, he spent weeks moving with a small party on
#     unfamiliar streams, living on sparse roots, small trapped animals, and occasional
#     fish and becoming visibly weakened.
#   reasoning: For foragers this corresponds to periods of near-starvation, loss of
#     tools, or social exclusion rather than debt; high mobility and serial unions raise
#     the chance of at least one severe subsistence shortfall.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Sustained period; ages 31–32
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: While separated from his main kin group on a multi-day foraging trip, he
#     was overpowered by several men from another band and forced into sex under threat
#     of being killed or left injured, then released with warnings not to retaliate.
#   reasoning: Male victimization is possible but less frequent than female; risk rises
#     with intergroup conflict and captivity scenarios, yet remains a minority outcome.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Single event; age 34
#   type: sexual_violence
# - event: In a dispute at a shared fishing place over access to a trap line and an
#     accusation of theft, he was beaten with fists and a stick, leaving him with a
#     broken tooth and badly bruised ribs that took weeks to heal.
#   reasoning: Adult men in mobile hunter-fisher-trapper lives commonly experience serious
#     fights, ambushes, or beatings (often connected to disputes, raids, or retaliation),
#     making this the most likely subtype.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Single event; age 40
#   type: physical_assault
# - event: He served in an ad hoc war party drawn from allied camps, carrying spear
#     and club on night approaches and acting as a tracker/scout during retaliatory
#     raids and defensive watches along the foothill routes.
#   reasoning: There were no formal states or standing armies; male participation would
#     be ad hoc raiding/defense rather than 'service' in a formal sense, so this is
#     relatively low.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Recurring pattern (seasonal/episodic raids); ages 23–26
#   type: military_service
# - event: When raiding intensified, his camp repeatedly broke up and fled into higher
#     forest ridges; he helped move children and supplies at night, avoided main river
#     paths, and returned to find shelters and drying racks torn down or burned.
#   reasoning: Forager conflict often affects camps directly via flight, loss of resources,
#     or temporary displacement; his highly mobile life fits repeated moves prompted
#     by threat.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Recurring pattern with multiple displacements; ages 30–35
#   type: civilian_war_exposure

Sena was born the youngest child in a cluster of shelters set back from a river in the western uplands that separate the Irrawaddy basin from the Bay of Bengal drainages. People lived by moving camp, following fish runs, fruiting trees, and game. They spoke a Tibeto-Burman tongue and measured danger by the distance to the next friendly hearth. Spirits were part of daily handling: before crossing a fast channel, a pinch of cooked ricegrass seed and a shred of dried fish went onto a flat stone, with a few low words to the river-owner so it would not take a child.

His father Rasa kept fish traps and hunting gear in good order and moved between water and forest without wasted steps. Rasa had two wives. Sena’s mother Sali traveled far for food even with small children, passing Sena to the other wife, Rima, or to an older sibling when she needed both hands to dig tubers. Sena grew up watching the division of tasks and the bargaining that kept it smooth: Sali wanted to range; Rima counted bundles and reminded people what was owed.

Sena’s oldest brother Kama was already large enough to carry a pole basket when Sena was still being carried on a hip. Kama spoke slowly and corrected Sena’s knots with a fingertip. The second brother, Taro, laughed at warnings and liked to throw a spear into water just to see the splash. Danu, only a little older than Sena, stayed close to the river. Mina, their sister, had died at birth years before Sena arrived; her name was spoken when Sali saw a newborn’s skin go pale or when a baby’s cry thinned. Sali’s watchfulness settled on Sena. She checked his feet for leeches, checked the tree line before she squatted to urinate, and kept him close when strangers approached.

As a boy he learned to sleep with one ear open. He did not enjoy the shouting that sometimes rose when men argued over a net place or when women accused one another of keeping back dried fish. When the talk tightened, he slipped away to the water’s edge and practiced setting small nooses for river birds. He liked dawn. The mist off the river meant cooler air and a quiet start before voices filled the camp.

By ten he could read where the current broke around a submerged log and place a basket trap so fish would funnel into it. Rasa made him repeat routes—this ridge, that saddle, the spring under the fig tree—until he could do it without thinking. Danu and Sena spent long afternoons checking traps together. They teased each other over who got the fattest eel, then split it and roasted it on green sticks. Taro drifted in and out, always with new scrapes, always with fresh stories.

At eighteen Sena took up an adult share of responsibility and formed his first pair-bond with Kori from a neighboring camp. She worked steadily and expected the same. Sena brought in fish, small game, and honey when the season allowed, and he liked the work that let him move quietly. When talk became heated, Kori pressed him to speak up. He answered in short phrases and tried to end disputes by giving away a portion of his catch. It calmed some people and irritated others.

Violence intensified when Sena was in his early twenties. Men returned from scouting with news of traps cut, smoke seen where it did not belong, a body found with a broken skull. His mother's brother Naro, who had been a route-knower and storyteller, died that same season. At twenty-three Sena joined an ad hoc war party assembled by an allied leader, Reno. There was no uniform, no oath, no banner. Each man carried his own spear, club, and a few points wrapped in leaf. Sena moved ahead of the main group, crouched behind trees, and signaled with bird calls when paths were clear. He disliked the noise after a raid—shouting, bragging, the angry crying from the other camp—but he kept going back at twenty-four and twenty-six, because refusing would leave his family exposed.

Kori and Sena broke apart when he was twenty-five. She wanted a man who stayed near her people and defended a fixed fishing place. Sena went where the group needed him and where food could be found. He left her camp without a fight, taking only his own tools.

At twenty-seven, during a lean stretch of travel, Sena crossed a river bend and saw a drying rack in an empty camp. Dried fish hung in bundles, and stone points lay wrapped in bark near a hearth. He took a bundle and two points, packed them into his basket, and moved on. He told himself he would bring something back. He never did. The memory stuck. When strangers looked at him too long after that, he wondered what they had heard.

He entered a second union with Binu at twenty-eight. Their first child, a daughter, was born when Sena was twenty-nine. Sali insisted the infant be named Mina, for the sister who had died. The baby died the same day. Sali placed a tiny pinch of ash and crushed leaf into the fire and spoke to the camp’s dead so they would not be lonely. Sena sat apart and sharpened a point until the edge crumbled.

Raiding pressure rose again when Sena was thirty. His camp broke up repeatedly and fled to higher forest ridges at night. He carried children and a rolled sleeping mat, moving without speaking. When they returned, drying racks had been cut down and shelters torn apart. At thirty-one a hostile group forced them away from a favored river stretch. In the flight Sena lost cached nets and a spare spear. For weeks he traveled with a small party on unfamiliar streams, eating sparse roots, small trapped animals, and occasional fish. Rasa kept them organized, assigning who would check which pools and who would watch for signs of pursuit. That year ended with everyone thinner and quick to anger.

Rasa died when Sena was thirty-two, after a short illness that left him coughing and unable to keep food down. The next morning Kama took over the household decisions, and Rima began counting stores more tightly. Sena left soon after, saying he would look for better water and new allies. He carried his father’s old net needle in his pouch.

At thirty-four, separated from his group on a multi-day foraging trip, Sena was caught by several men from another band. They forced him into sex under threat of death and warned him not to retaliate. He walked back to his camp with his jaw clenched, washing himself in the river until his skin reddened. After that he avoided traveling alone when he could. When he could not, he doubled back on his own tracks and watched ridgelines longer than necessary.

His third union with Tima began when he was thirty-five, during a spell of constant movement. It lasted four years and ended without a fight when camps stabilized and she chose to stay with her family. Sena did not argue. He drifted.

At thirty-nine he formed a partnership with Lapa. She wanted clear agreements: which fishing place, which days he would be gone, how much he would bring back. Sena agreed, then kept leaving on long trips. At forty a dispute broke out at a shared fishing place. Palo, a rival fisher, accused Sena of taking from a trap line. The argument turned into blows. Sena was beaten with fists and a stick, losing a tooth and taking bruised ribs that made it painful to breathe for weeks. He laughed once while spitting blood into the sand, a short sound without humor. Lapa ended the partnership not long after, calling him unreliable and dangerous to keep close.

His sons came during these unions: Kanu when Sena was thirty-two, Toku when he was thirty-five, Gama when he was thirty-eight. A younger daughter, Saku, was born when he was forty-one. Sena spent stretches with them, teaching knots, showing how to find crab holes and how to test a branch before trusting it. Then he would leave again, pulled by routes and by tension with partners.

Taro died when Sena was thirty-six. After the mourning fire died down, Taro’s children and obligations did not. Sena took on long stretches of helping—repairing baskets, hauling water, teaching nephews to set traps, sitting up at night when sickness came through camp. Sali died when Sena was forty-five. He cut a lock of his hair with a stone flake and left it by the river stone where she used to place offerings.

Sena's last significant union was with Hanu when he was forty-seven. It was quieter. She liked to sit with him at dusk and roast sliced tubers while he mended net cord. He told short stories about routes and mistakes and let her do most of the talking. Rima, his father's second wife who had helped raise him, died when Sena was fifty-one. They separated when he was fifty-three and she rejoined her relatives after an argument over where to camp for the season.

Danu, his closest brother in age, died when Sena was fifty-five. By his late fifties Sena lived mainly in an extended household centered on Kama and the children of Taro. Kanu and Gama had their own hearth groups, and Sena visited them but did not stay. Toku and Saku were both still young and alive, making their way, and Sena watched them from a distance more often than he helped.

At sixty an acute illness took him. He coughed, ran hot, then could not stand without help. His niece’s son Balo brought him sips of water and held him upright while Kama spoke low to the river-owner and placed a shred of dried fish on the offering stone. When Sena died, they wrapped him in woven mats and laid him in a shallow grave on a ridge above the water, placing his net needle and a small stone point by his hand.
