# cause_of_death: Acute infectious disease (epidemic fever, respiratory infection, measles-like
#   illness)
# ethnicity: Yamato Japanese (local Japanese-speaking agrarian communities of Echigo/越後)
# father_occupation: Deceased (died before or shortly after birth)
# historical_context:
# - event: Collapse of the Kamakura shogunate (1333) and reordering of local authority
#     (estate managers, jitō/warrior administrators), with potential changes in dues
#     enforcement and village obligations.
#   timing: age 2–3 (1333–1334)
# - event: Heightened corvée/transport labor and in-kind taxation pressures typical
#     of medieval estate/village life (rice dues, timber/charcoal, road/river transport),
#     potentially intensified during regime turmoil.
#   timing: throughout life (1330–1337)
# - event: Cooler, variable climate of the early Little Ice Age in Japan, raising the
#     frequency of poor harvest years and making spring/autumn cold snaps more damaging
#     in upland areas like his (450m).
#   timing: throughout life, especially planting/harvest seasons
# - event: Heavy snowfall winters on the Japan Sea side (Uonuma/Echigo pattern), restricting
#     travel, limiting winter food access, and increasing respiratory illness risk during
#     severe years.
#   timing: each winter, ages 0–6 (1330–1337 winters)
# - event: Regional flood/landslide risk from intense precipitation in Niigata’s river
#     systems, periodically damaging paddies, paths, and stored food and forcing communal
#     repair labor.
#   timing: any year; most likely summer–autumn storms
# - event: Periodic epidemic waves (undifferentiated 'fever' outbreaks) spreading via
#     travelers/temple networks and market towns, raising child mortality even in rural
#     districts.
#   timing: intermittent; more likely ages 3–6
# household_social_status: Commoner peasant cultivators (hyakushō-type village household;
#   owing dues to estate/warrior authorities)

#   at birth, child incorporated in maternal household)
# language: Japanese (Japonic; local Echigo/medieval Japanese vernacular)
# literacy: Neither read nor write (preliterate child)
# mental_disorder: No—unlikely to meet criteria for any modern-recognized mental disorder
#   (within typical range for age/context)
# migration: Moved a short distance within the same district/province (to nearby village/kin
#   household) once
# mother_occupation: Peasant cultivator and household manager (field labor + domestic
#   work, food processing, childcare)
# narrative_plan:
#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Oharu
#     narrative_role: Primary caregiver and household manager; affectionate but often
#       stern from necessity, relying on Hachirōmaru as a capable helper. Relationship
#       is close, with pride in his diligence mixed with shame/anger when his petty
#       theft becomes known.
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: 1330
#     name: Jinzaburō
#     narrative_role: Dies before or shortly after Hachirōmaru’s birth; exists in the
#       story as absence—lessons about dependence on kin, vulnerability to dues, and
#       the social precarity of a widow-led household.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Otsune
#     narrative_role: 'Practical older woman who provides childcare and discipline after
#       the move; teaches small shrine/household rites and winter thrift. Relationship:
#       steady, sometimes sharp-tongued, but fundamentally protective.'
#     role: maternal grandmother (or senior female kin in receiving household after
#       the move)
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Sadayoshi
#     narrative_role: 'Takes them in or anchors the relocation; sets expectations for
#       labor and behavior. Relationship: not unkind, but status-conscious—quick to
#       insist Hachirōmaru not bring trouble to the household.'
#     role: maternal uncle (household head of kin he moves in with)
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 4
#     connection: Begins after the move when he plays near neighbors’ work areas and
#       food stores; scarcity and embarrassment in the kin household make small thefts
#       both tempting and socially dangerous.
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   - age: 5
#     connection: Becomes a recurring pattern through winter tightness and spring hunger;
#       discovery triggers scolding from Oharu and reprimand from Sadayoshi about village
#       reputation and obligations.
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   - age: 6
#     connection: Tapers after closer supervision and being put to more purposeful tasks;
#       ends before/around his final illness as household attention shifts to sickness
#       and ritual care.
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Yasabē
#     prominence: ages 4–6, especially during discovery and neighborhood tension over
#       missing items
#     relationship: neighboring peasant household head; owner of some of the food/tools
#       taken
#   - name: Myōen
#     prominence: ages 2–6; appears around the younger brother’s death rites and later
#       communal prayers during sickness seasons
#     relationship: local temple attendant/monk who visits the hamlet for rites and
#       memorial services
#   - name: Koma
#     prominence: ages 4–6; social link for play, gossip, and being noticed
#     relationship: older village girl (approx. 8–10) who corrals younger children during
#       work days
#   - name: Tōzō
#     prominence: ages 4–6; provides peer pressure and opportunities that intersect
#       with the petty theft
#     relationship: teen boy in the kin household who teaches him simple tasks and sometimes
#       dares him
#   siblings:
#   - birth_year: 1334
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 1334
#     name: Chiyomaru
#     narrative_role: A brief, fragile presence—his birth marks both hope and added
#       strain in a fatherless household; Hachirōmaru’s earliest memory of him is as
#       a swaddled bundle and the quiet, tense days around sickness and mourning, shaping
#       his sense that food and warmth can vanish suddenly.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Adults trust him with errands and watching small tasks; the contrast
#       makes his petty theft more shocking and framed as a moral failing rather than
#       childish impulse.
#     scene: He insists on finishing small chores—stacking firewood evenly, keeping
#       a bundle of hemp fibers from tangling, and remembering which tools belong to
#       which neighbor—despite being told 'good enough.'
#     timing: ages 3–6, especially after relocation
#     trait: Conscientiousness (91st percentile)
#   - consequence: He gains access to places where food and small items are unattended
#       (enabling the theft incident) and is more visible—so gossip spreads quickly
#       when misbehavior is noticed.
#     scene: At matsuri and communal work days, he drifts toward groups of older children
#       and adults, chatting, boasting small feats (carrying water, gathering kindling),
#       and inserting himself into games near the shrine approach.
#     timing: ages 4–6
#     trait: Extraversion (83rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Helps him function in a stressed household; also means shame doesn’t
#       deter him as strongly at first, allowing the petty-theft pattern to recur until
#       adults intervene.
#     scene: During harsh winters and after scoldings, he recovers quickly—sleeping
#       easily, returning to play, and treating setbacks as temporary rather than brooding
#       or fearing punishment.
#     timing: ages 2–6
#     trait: Low Neuroticism (14th percentile)
#   - consequence: Makes him quick at learning practical routines and village norms;
#       also quick at spotting opportunities (e.g., when a storage basket is left unattended).
#     scene: He shows curiosity about temple chants and travelers’ talk, asks why the
#       snowline differs by slope, and invents little 'systems' for sorting nuts, cords,
#       and kindling by size.
#     timing: ages 3–6
#     trait: Openness (72nd percentile) + Intelligence (66th percentile)
# number_of_siblings: '1'
# religion: 'Everyday syncretic kami–Buddhist practice: local shrine visits/matsuri
#   + household/field rites + Buddhist temple rites for ancestors (main pattern)'
# sibling_ages_at_death:
# - 0
# sibling_sexes:
# - M
# structured_incidents:
# - event: 'A recurring pattern of small petty theft: he would sneak handfuls of dried
#     millet/rice or pickled food from a neighbor’s storage basket and sometimes take
#     small items like cord or a wooden tool handle while playing near work areas; it
#     was treated as a nuisance and a shame to his mother rather than a formal crime.'
#   reasoning: Young children sometimes take small items/food, but sustained or meaningful
#     property crime is unlikely given age and supervision.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 4–6, after the household’s move to a nearby village/kin household
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime

Hachirōmaru was born on December 7, 1330, in an upland hamlet in Echigo Province, where villagers spoke Japanese and lived under estate dues collected through warrior administrators of the Kamakura shogunate. His mother, Oharu, set rice and a pinch of salt before the household kami shelf and carried offerings of washed rice to the local shrine at seasonal rites; she also took him to the temple when a monk came to chant for the dead.

His father, Jinzaburō, died in 1330, and the household ran on Oharu’s hands. She hoed field edges, stripped hemp, tended a cooking fire, and kept accounts in memory. Hachirōmaru learned to stack kindling by thickness and to coil cord so it did not kink. When other children scattered after being scolded, he returned to finish what he had started. He talked easily with older boys and followed them to communal work days, listening to talk about dues rice, timber loads, and who had become the new man to answer to as Kamakura’s rule broke in 1333.

A second son, Chiyomaru, arrived in 1334. He died before the year turned. Myōen, the temple attendant, struck a small bell and chanted while Oharu set a bowl of rice and a piece of dried fish by the body.

In 1335, Oharu moved with Hachirōmaru to the nearby village where her brother Sadayoshi headed a household. Winters were heavy with snow; paths narrowed, and stores mattered. At four, Hachirōmaru began taking handfuls of dried grain from Yasabē’s basket when adults were in the paddies’ repair work, and once he pocketed a short length of cord and a worn tool handle. At five, the pattern continued through late winter. Yasabē complained, and Sadayoshi made him return the items in front of the yard. Oharu washed his hands and made him clap twice and bow at the shrine gate with a small offering of rice.

In early February 1337, after a neighbor’s child fell sick, Hachirōmaru developed an acute fever and cough. On February 11, he died. Myōen chanted again, and the family placed him for burial at the temple ground with incense and a small rice offering.
