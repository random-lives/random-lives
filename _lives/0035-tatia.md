#     name: Lucius
#     narrative_role: Mixed smallholder farmer; emotionally reserved but fair. He values
#       order and steady work, is wary of Tatia’s talkativeness and curiosity, yet teaches
#       her routes, measures, and the practicalities of exchange before he dies when

#     role: father
#   - death_year: 347
#     name: Marcia
#     narrative_role: Household manager and subsistence producer; affectionate but firm.
#       She relies on the older sisters to help with infants; with Tatia she alternates
#       pride in her energy with worry that she draws attention. Her death triggers

#     role: mother
#   children: []
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 34
#     connection: After separation, she leans harder on market trade for independence;

#       that teach her to watch hands, knots, and weights.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 40
#     connection: Around her mother’s death and heavier responsibilities, distraction
#       and fatigue make her more vulnerable at crowded fair-days; one notable loss
#       (a sack of cloth/food) becomes a cautionary story in the family.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 44
#     connection: After years of learning from losses and disputes, she is increasingly
#       trusted to carry goods, relay prices, and arrange exchanges; this counters some
#       stigma from separation.
#     incident: major_achievement
#   - age: 52
#     connection: At peak reputation, neighbors ask her to source scarce items through
#       contacts; she becomes an informal broker for kin households despite not being
#       elite.
#     incident: major_achievement
#   - age: 40
#     connection: Following her mother’s death, she spends extended periods caring for

#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds broader contacts and curiosity-driven trade advantages, but
#       also attracts gossip about being 'restless' or insufficiently modest.
#     scene: At market and on roads she lingers to hear travelers’ stories, asks about
#       distant shrines and unfamiliar rites, and experiments with new goods/uses (different
#       dyes, lamp oil, iron fittings) even when others dismiss them.
#     timing: Adolescence through middle adulthood (ages 14-50)
#     trait: Openness (very high)
#   - consequence: Helps her succeed as a petty trader and information-carrier; can
#       escalate conflict with her partner who wants privacy/control.
#     scene: She initiates conversations with strangers, mediates small disputes over
#       measures, and keeps relationships warm across households; in tense moments she
#       talks rather than withdraws.
#     timing: All phases, especially ages 15-55
#     trait: Extraversion (very high)
#   - consequence: Initial vulnerability to property crime and disadvantage in disputes;
#       later she compensates with routines, trusted partners, and careful habits.
#     scene: She learns best by repetition and demonstration; early on she struggles
#       with complicated accounting of obligations and is occasionally fooled by short-weighting
#       or confusing coin values.
#     timing: Adolescence and early trading years (ages 14-40)
#     trait: Intelligence (low, 15th percentile)
#   - consequence: Rebuilds trust after separation; underpins her later reputation for
#       dependable dealing.
#     scene: She develops fixed packing routines (knots, tallies, hiding places), keeps
#       promises about deliveries, and shows up reliably for caregiving shifts even
#       when resentful.
#     timing: Young adulthood onward (ages 20-58)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (moderately high)
#   - consequence: Contributes to marital breakdown and some kin friction, but also
#       helps her resist exploitation in trade.
#     scene: She can be blunt when cheated and does not easily defer to scolding kin;
#       she argues her case loudly in family councils.
#     timing: Young adulthood through middle adulthood (ages 18-45)
#     trait: Agreeableness (somewhat low)
#   - consequence: Allows long-term participation in trade and caregiving despite intermittent
#       hardship.
#     scene: After frightening events or losses she shows distress but returns to baseline
#       functioning; maintains social ties and work routines rather than spiraling into
#       chronic dysfunction.
#     timing: Throughout adulthood
#     trait: No clear diagnosable mental disorder
# number_of_children: '0'
# number_of_siblings: '5'
# occupation: Petty trader/market seller (selling surplus, cloth, eggs/dairy; itinerant
#   or periodic market attendance)
# religion: Traditional local polytheistic practice in a Romanized form (household offerings
#   to protective spirits/ancestors, vows at local shrines/springs/trees/rocks; some
#   Roman deities identified with local ones)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: 'Recurring pattern: when she went to periodic markets and fair-days near
#     the coast and along local tracks, small but meaningful losses accumulated—cut
#     purse strings, short-weighed exchanges, and at least one incident where a sack
#     of cloth or eggs/dairy meant for barter was taken while she was distracted at
#     a stall.'
#   reasoning: As a petty trader/market seller handling goods and exchange, she faced
#     elevated exposure to theft and fraud compared with purely homebound farming households.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Ages 33–45
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: 'Sustained period: despite her separation and precarious standing, she built
#     a reputation as a dependable market seller—known for consistent measures and for
#     securing scarce items (salt, iron tools, lamp oil, dyed cloth) through her contacts—so
#     neighbors routinely asked her to carry goods and arrange exchanges on their behalf.'
#   reasoning: Non-elite rural women rarely left recorded achievements, but informal
#     local success—becoming a reliable trader, known for fair dealing or skills—was
#     possible, especially with high extraversion/openness.
#   tier: 1

Tatia was born on August 27, 307, in the upland farms above the Atlantic in what the Roman administration counted as Gallaecia. Officials and priests used Latin; in her household people spoke rough vernacular Latin mixed with the older Celtic speech of the district. Her family lived by smallholding—cereals and garden plots, cattle and pigs, firewood from the mixed forests—and kept the old ways: a pinch of grain at the threshold when a journey began, a small clay lamp lit for the household spirits, and vows made at a spring on the edge of the fields.

She arrived last. Julia, Flavia, Aurelia, and Valeria were already girls who could carry water and mind a pot. Between Valeria and Tatia there had been Marcus, a boy who died before he took more than milk. The sisters spoke of him without ceremony. Their father Lucius stayed quiet at meals and took care with tools, sharpening a sickle until it cut clean. Their mother Marcia held the house together, setting the spinning in motion in the dark months and keeping track of who had lent a cart and who still owed a day’s help.

Tatia followed voices. As soon as she could walk, she pulled herself toward neighbors’ yards and the edge of the track where travelers passed, asking questions and repeating any answers she got. Marcia snapped at her for lingering, then used her to carry messages because she never forgot a name. When men from the district gathered to talk about assessments—how much grain, how many hides, what a household would have to provide—Tatia listened from behind a door and then told her sisters everything, with extra details that made them laugh. Julia would tap her forehead and tell her to save her breath for the work. Tatia talked anyway.

By the time she was ten she moved constantly between her sisters' households and those of aunts and cousins. She learned where each family kept their salt and which aunt hid a few coins in a folded cloth tucked high in the roof beams. She learned the routines of the old rites. Valeria took her to a spring where people left small offerings: a handful of beans, a braided ribbon, a broken pin. Valeria taught her the names used in their family for the presences that guarded places: the spirits of the water, the boundary markers, the dead who still expected attention. Tatia liked the practical side of it—how a vow was spoken, what was left, how you did not touch what had been offered.

At fourteen she began going to market days with Aurelia, who had the arms and shoulders for carrying heavy loads. They took eggs, cheese, and a little cloth, and they came back with iron nails, lamp oil, salt, and a few small luxuries when they could manage it. Tatia watched bargaining closely but struggled when trades involved unfamiliar coin and different weights. Someone could show her a measure once and she would still mix it up later. Aurelia corrected her sharply. Tatia, stung, argued back instead of going quiet, and the two of them would bicker along the road until a joke from Julia—usually a blunt comment about their bladders and how far it was to the next stopping place—broke it.

She married at nineteen. Gaius lived only a few kilometers away, near enough that Tatia still walked back to her mother’s yard for help with grinding or washing. The match was practical; Gaius wanted a working woman, Marcia wanted her youngest settled, and Tatia wanted the freedom of her own hearth. The household started well, with Tatia rising early to set a pot on the fire and then heading out to tend the garden and check the pigs. She insisted on going to markets even when Gaius said it drew attention. She liked the road and the noise of stalls. She liked the talk. She found excuses—salt was needed, a tool had to be replaced, someone had offered a good price for cloth.

Imperial demands tightened as she entered adulthood. Men came with lists and expectations, sometimes requiring carting for officials, sometimes pressing for produce beyond what a household felt it could spare. At markets, prices jumped and fell, and people argued over coin that looked new and coin that looked clipped. Tatia did not master the logic of it. She learned by rules she could repeat: accept coins from certain hands, avoid others; trade for salt when possible; keep cloth because cloth held value when coin did not. She tied her bundles the same way each time and began hiding a few small items inside a folded tunic instead of in a basket.

When Lucius died in 336, Tatia did not inherit land outright; her security depended on her sisters and their husbands. She returned more often to Julia’s household, carrying messages and small goods, offering labor in exchange for grain. The strain in her marriage sharpened into open fights. Gaius wanted order and silence. Tatia came home late from markets, full of news, and corrected him in front of neighbors when he miscounted what was owed. He struck her during one argument—an open-handed blow at first, then a hard hit when she did not stop talking. After that it happened again. In 339 she left him and walked back to her sisters’ cluster of homes with what she could carry. People discussed it openly. Flavia, whose pride ran ahead of her kindness, treated Tatia’s return as an embarrassment. Julia took her in with fewer words.

Separated and without children, Tatia made herself useful in the one way she controlled: she traded. She took eggs, butter, and small lengths of cloth to fair-days nearer the coast and to market gatherings along the main track. She watched hands and counted items twice, yet her distractions cost her. In 341 someone cut the cord of her purse in a crowd. She felt the tug and turned too late. She shouted, shoved through people, and grabbed the wrong man’s sleeve. The seller of measures—an older woman called Bracara—pulled Tatia away and told her to stop making a scene. Bracara later showed her how to knot cords so they could not be cut quickly, and how to keep a thumb on a bundle’s tie when someone pressed too close.

The thefts continued as a pattern, smaller and more wearing than a single disaster. Traders shorted her on salt. A woman at a stall switched a good needle for a bent one as Tatia argued about a price. In 347, after her mother died, Tatia went to a fair-day carrying a sack that held cloth and dried cheese meant for exchange. She stopped to speak to a cart-driver, Faustus, who always had news about where officials had been seen and which roads had trouble. When she turned back, the sack was gone. She searched the edges of the crowd and the ditch beyond, found only a torn strap, and walked home without the goods. That loss stayed in the family’s accounting for years.

Flavia died in 342, leaving children who still needed help. Tatia took on long stretches of caregiving—washing a feverish child, carrying water, sleeping on a mat near the hearth so she could feed a sick relative broth before dawn. After Marcia’s death, the extended household tightened further, and Tatia’s labor became a bargaining chip: she cared, she carried, she traded, and she ate at the shared table.

As the years passed, her trading changed. She stopped trying to follow complicated chains of coin value and leaned into what she could do well: remember people, keep promises, show up. She developed routines. She packed the same way every time, counted eggs aloud as she laid them into straw, tied knots that matched Bracara’s teaching. She insisted on using the same measure cup when selling, even when she could have gained by shaving it. Her bluntness helped her in disputes; when cheated, she said so directly and refused to smooth it over.

By 351 neighbors began asking her to carry goods for them. She went out with a list tied into her belt: a request for salt, a request for lamp oil, a request for a small iron tool, and sometimes a demand for dyed cloth if a household had the means. She returned with what she had promised or with a clear explanation for what she could not get. People tolerated the gossip about her separation because they wanted what she could bring back. In the late 350s she handled more exchanges, sometimes arranging a swap between two households that did not trust each other enough to meet directly. She took pride in getting it right, and in returning without missing items, and she enjoyed the talk that came with it. She laughed easily, especially at crude jokes on the road, and she liked eating smoked pork fat with coarse bread after a long day, sitting on a low stone by the byre where she could hear everyone in the yard.

Losses kept coming. Aurelia died in 353, which reduced the family’s capacity for heavy carrying and fieldwork. Julia died in 357, and Tatia's place in the family became more precarious. Valeria, stubborn and long-lived, insisted that Tatia stayed. Tatia repaid her with work—more time in the household, less on the road. Markets also changed as she aged; coin came and went, obligations shifted, and the roads sometimes felt less safe. She still went out when needed, talking to Faustus and other carriers, gathering news of where requisitions had been taken and where prices had climbed.

In December of 365, she was in Valeria’s household, helping prepare food and laying out goods for the next market day. She bent to lift a pot, straightened, and collapsed. Valeria and her daughters washed the body and wrapped it in cloth. They carried her to a burial place used by the family and left small offerings with her—bread, a little salt, and a lamp lit briefly at the grave before they covered it.
