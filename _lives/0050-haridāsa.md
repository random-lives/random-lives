# ethnicity: Maithil/Mithila Indo-Aryan agrarian (Tirhut/Mithila region; Maithili/Apabhramsha
#   continuum)
# father_occupation: Agricultural laborer/servant attached to cultivating patrons (field
#   work, herding, general hired labor)
# historical_context:
# - event: Early expansion of Sena power from Bengal into Bihar (gradual political-military
#     pressure and changing networks of officials/land grants), potentially increasing
#     uncertainty in revenue collection and obligations in the wider region.
#   timing: age 30–62 (c. 1110s–1145)
# - event: Recurrent flooding and river-course instability in the Kosi/Bagmati–north
#     Bihar plains (breaches of earthen embankments, waterlogging, loss of stored grain),
#     periodically disrupting cultivation and labor markets.
#   timing: Recurring across life; most likely adult years age 15–62
# - event: At least one episode of monsoon failure/poor rains leading to localized crop
#     shortfalls and high grain prices (not necessarily a famous pan-Indian famine,
#     but a severe local scarcity episode).
#   timing: Most likely mid-adulthood, age 20–55
# - event: Endemic malaria/fever ecology in the Gangetic plain (seasonal spikes after
#     rains) and periodic wider outbreaks of acute respiratory and gastrointestinal
#     disease affecting villages simultaneously.
#   timing: Recurring; especially rainy/post-rain seasons throughout life
# - event: Growth/strengthening of temple-centered Brahmanical institutions and land
#     grants in the region, increasing ritual obligations and often channeling labor/produce
#     to endowed estates (affecting dependents and laborers as well as cultivators).
#   timing: age 10–62
# household_social_status: Low-status service/occupational household (artisan/menial/service
#   role tied to patrons; limited prestige)
# household_structure_at_birth: Irregular/low-status union or nonmarital birth (concubinage,

#   marriage)
# mental_disorder: No clear modern-diagnosable mental disorder/pathology (personality
#   within normal range; functional despite low conscientiousness)
# migration: Stayed in/near birth village (same village or within a few kilometers)
#   most of life
# mother_occupation: Household/domestic labor + seasonal agricultural fieldwork (weeding,
#   transplanting, harvesting) for patrons/landholders
# narrative_plan:
#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: 1122
#     name: Bhola
#     narrative_role: An attached farm servant/laborer who tries to secure grain shares
#       through patron ties; relationship with Haridāsa is strained—he admires the boy’s
#       quick mind but punishes his unreliability and resents the stigma around the
#       union.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: 1142
#     name: Dhaniyā
#     narrative_role: Runs the household and works peak-season fields; deeply protective
#       and pragmatic. She is the main emotional anchor, even when she scolds Haridāsa
#       for risky choices and shameful rumors.
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: 1103
#     name: Ajjī Surasā
#     narrative_role: An elder woman tied to household ritual and remedies; gives Haridāsa
#       stories, sayings, and practical knowledge. Her death shifts domestic authority
#       more fully to Dhaniyā.
#     role: paternal grandmother (likely caretaker influence even if not always co-resident)
#   children:
#   - birth_year: 1105
#     death_age: 46
#     death_year: 1151
#     name: Gopāla
#     narrative_role: Eldest son; grows into a capable worker, sometimes embarrassed
#       by his father’s reputation but loyal. In adulthood he helps secure the joint
#       household’s standing and organizes care during Haridāsa’s final illness.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1111
#     death_age: 11
#     death_year: 1122
#     name: Madhava
#     narrative_role: Second son; bright and cherished. His death is a turning point
#       that deepens household piety and contributes to later caregiving burdens (illness
#       in the family cluster).
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1116
#     death_age: 29
#     death_year: 1145
#     name: Kamala
#     narrative_role: Daughter; competent and outspoken. She becomes an important caregiver
#       in the joint household; her death the same year as Haridāsa adds a sense of
#       a ‘bad year’ and strains the family’s labor capacity.
#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 33
#     connection: Tied to a run of poor rains and high grain prices; triggers borrowing,
#       tighter patron control over his labor, and increases dependence on his wife’s
#       fieldwork and kin support.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 36
#     connection: 'Resolution phase: partial repayment through extra seasons of attached
#       labor; household still constrained, shaping later choices (risk-taking, willingness
#       to accept dangerous work).'
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 41
#     connection: Occurs after debt years when he is pushing hard to rebuild grain security;
#       forces brothers and wife to cover his obligations and becomes a catalyst for
#       major caregiving demands within the joint household.
#     incident: serious_accident
#   - age: 49
#     connection: Flood pressure forces collective action; his quick problem-solving
#       and ability to direct labor in the moment leads to public credit and slightly
#       improved treatment by headman/patron.
#     incident: major_achievement
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-7 (1083-1090)
#     key_events:
#     - Raised in a stigmatized/irregular-origin household; learns early to read moods
#       and negotiate adults (patrons’ men, elders).
#     - Frequent infant deaths around him normalize ritual protection and fear of wet-season
#       illness.
#     - Begins tagging along to fields and cattle lines; shows quick grasp of routes,
#       tools, and people’s habits.
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 8-17 (1091-1100)
#     key_events:
#     - Older sister Sītā dies (1096), becoming his first remembered major bereavement
#       and pushing him into more adult labor.
#     - Develops a reputation for being clever but unreliable—good in a pinch, poor
#       at routine tasks; conflicts with father over discipline.
#     - First sexual boundary-crossing experience likely occurs in this phase (premarital
#       encounter or transactional context).
#     phase: Later childhood / adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-32 (1101-1115)
#     key_events:
#     - Marriage to Lachhmī (1103) stabilizes his social position despite low status;
#       joins/anchors a joint household with siblings/kin.
#     - Birth of Gopāla (1105) and Madhava (1111); increasing work demands in patrons’
#       fields and seasonal labor peaks.
#     - Encounters growing temple/landed institutional demands (extra labor days, ritual
#       dues) as local authority networks tighten.
#     phase: Early adult life
#   - age_range: 33-50 (1116-1133)
#     key_events:
#     - Severe economic crisis and debt-bonded labor period (1116-1119) following weak
#       monsoons; wife’s labor pledged and household diets tightened.
#     - Death of son Madhava (1122) and father Bhola (1122) creates simultaneous emotional
#       and labor shocks; caregiving responsibilities rise as illness clusters in kin.
#     - Serious leg injury with infection (1124-1125) reduces capacity; sister Padmā
#       dies (1124), removing a social ‘fixer’ from the family network.
#     phase: Midlife
#   - age_range: 51-62 (1134-1145)
#     key_events:
#     - 'Flood year achievement (1132, age 49) has lasting aftermath into his 50s: better
#       grain share and a measure of respect despite status.'
#     - Ongoing caregiving in joint household (aging mother, sick kin, grandchildren),
#       with brothers Keshava and Balarāma prominent co-residents.
#     - 'Final year (1145): daughter Kamala dies and Haridāsa succumbs to acute respiratory
#       illness; household leadership shifts toward eldest son and surviving brothers.'
#     phase: Later adulthood / old age

#       and announces observances
#   partners:
#   - name: Lachhmī
#     narrative_role: Wife in a socially recognized marriage; steady, hardworking, and
#       socially sharper than Haridāsa. Their bond mixes affection and frustration—she
#       manages consequences of his inconsistency and becomes crucial during debt and
#       injury.
#     relationship_end_year: 1145

#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 1075
#     name: Gaurī
#     narrative_role: A name spoken softly in the family as the first loss; Haridāsa

#       frailty.

#     death_year: 1078

#     death_age: 18

#     name: Sītā
#     narrative_role: The older sister Haridāsa actually remembers—she carries him,

#       makes him wary of attachment.
#     sex: F

#     death_age: 45
#     death_year: 1124
#     name: Padmā

#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 1081

#     death_age: 62
#     death_year: 1145

#     death_age: 65
#     death_year: 1153
#     name: Balarāma
#     narrative_role: The younger brother who outlives Haridāsa; practical and more
#       disciplined, he becomes a stabilizing adult presence in the joint household
#       and later a key mourner.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1090
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 1090
#     name: Mohana
#     narrative_role: Another infant loss; reinforces the sense that survival is partly
#       luck and partly ritual care.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1092
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 1092
#     name: Rādhā
#     narrative_role: Youngest sibling; barely part of Haridāsa’s memory but present
#       in family laments and in the mother’s narrative of hardship.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: More scolding/punishment from father and patrons; wife and sister
#       often have to repair relationships; increases vulnerability during debt years.
#     scene: He forgets agreed labor days, arrives late, or leaves tasks half-done,
#       then improvises excuses or last-minute solutions when confronted.
#     timing: Most visible from adolescence through midlife (ages 12-45)
#     trait: Very low conscientiousness (9th percentile)
#   - consequence: Earns intermittent trust despite low status; helps household survive
#       crises, but also feeds resentment in others when paired with poor follow-through.
#     scene: He quickly learns who controls which resources, anticipates flood-water
#       behavior, and proposes practical fixes (where to pile earth, how to rotate workers,
#       how to bargain for grain).
#     timing: Childhood onward; peaks in the flood-year achievement (age 49)
#     trait: High intelligence (88th percentile)
#   - consequence: Fewer broad alliances; relies on a small set of kin ties, making
#       the joint household especially important.
#     scene: Prefers working with one or two familiar men rather than joining noisy
#       gatherings; speaks little in council until he has something pointed to say.
#     timing: Adulthood (ages 18-62)
#     trait: Low extraversion (20th percentile)
#   - consequence: Contributes to rumors and tension with patrons; increases the need
#       for kin (Padmā, Lachhmī) to manage reputation.
#     scene: Takes small liberties—keeping a little extra fodder, stretching measures,
#       or bending customary rules—especially when the household is hungry.
#     timing: Debt/crisis years and aftermath (ages 33-45)
#     trait: Lower honesty-humility (25th percentile)
#   - consequence: Occasional conflicts; but not a chronic violent pattern—he usually
#       de-escalates when consequences become clear.
#     scene: Can be sharp-tongued and stubborn in disputes over wages, grain shares,
#       or accusations about his origins/sexual conduct.
#     timing: Adolescence and early adulthood (ages 15-30)
#     trait: Moderately low agreeableness (37th percentile)
#   - consequence: Others sometimes interpret calmness as coldness; nevertheless it
#       helps in crisis coordination.
#     scene: In emergencies (flood, sickness in the house) he stays outwardly calm and
#       practical rather than panicking.
#     timing: Throughout, especially during accident recovery and flood response (ages
#       41-50)
#     trait: Low neuroticism (25th percentile)
#   - consequence: Community gossip, tension with Lachhmī, and vulnerability to patron
#       leverage; later he becomes more discreet to protect household stability.
#     scene: Early premarital encounter(s) and later at least one extramarital episode
#       or transactional encounter during market days/seasonal work, creating gossip
#       and friction at home.
#     timing: 'Premarital: ages 15-19 (c. 1098-1102); marital transgression more likely
#       during stress: ages 33-45'
#     trait: Nonstandard sexual history (confirmed)
#   - consequence: Debt risk returns, caregiving demands rise, and he develops lingering
#       stiffness that shapes his later work roles.
#     scene: Infected leg wound forces weeks of incapacity; he must accept help and
#       endure loss of status as others do his work.
#     timing: Age 41-42 (1124-1125)
#     trait: Serious health incident (confirmed) — accident subtype (confirmed)
#   - consequence: Strengthens joint-household bonds; limits his ability to take distant
#       work opportunities; contributes to fatigue in old age.
#     scene: Shares long nursing duties for an ailing parent/kin member and helps raise/oversee
#       dependents within the joint household, especially after clustered deaths/illness
#       years.
#     timing: Most prominent ages 39-62 (c. 1122-1145)
#     trait: Major caregiving (confirmed)
# number_of_children: '3'
# number_of_siblings: 10+
# occupation: Agricultural laborer/field worker (wage or in-kind labor on others' land;
#   seasonal harvesting, weeding, transplanting)
# religion: Household Hindu puja + village shrine worship (mixed local deities with
#   Shiva/Vishnu/Devi), festival observance, and life-cycle rites via local priests
#   when available

# structured_incidents:
# - event: After two weak monsoons and a bad harvest, his patron household reduced grain
#     payments and he took high-interest grain loans to keep his family fed; he fell
#     into a sustained debt relationship and had to pledge extra seasons of attached
#     labor and part of his wife's work to repay.
#   reasoning: As a dependent agricultural laborer with little buffer, a bad monsoon,
#     illness, or patron dispute could readily trigger debt bondage-like dependence
#     or periods of destitution at least once over 62 years.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Sustained period, age 33–36
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: During a year of local flooding, he was trusted to organize a rotating crew
#     of laborers to reinforce an earthen bund/embankment protecting the main fields
#     and homesteads; elders and the headman publicly credited him for keeping the breach
#     from spreading and ensured his household received a better share of grain payments
#     afterward.
#   reasoning: Illiteracy and low-status laboring position limit formal recognition;
#     still, local achievements (respected elder, dispute mediator, leading a work gang)
#     sometimes occurred but were not common.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Single event with lasting recognition, age 49
#   type: major_achievement
# - event: He slipped while cutting fodder/wood and took a deep gash to the lower leg
#     that became badly infected; he was laid up for weeks, needed help walking for
#     months, and could only return gradually to field work after the swelling and fever
#     eased.
#   reasoning: Agricultural labor involved falls, animal injuries, tool wounds, and
#     infections; a weeks-long incapacity event is plausible over a long life but not
#     inevitable.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Single event, age 41–42
#   type: serious_accident

Haridāsa was born on June 6, 1083, in a Maithil-speaking village near Pandaul in the north Bihar plain. The village sat under shifting overlordship—late Pāla-era authority felt through local chiefs, tax collectors, and land grants—and the calendar of work followed the monsoon more than any distant court. His household kept a small clay lamp burning on a shelf for Śiva and a village goddess; on ordinary mornings his mother smeared a little cow dung on the swept earth, set a pinch of rice and a few drops of water in front of the lamp, and murmured names she had learned from older women.

He arrived as the sixth child of a strained and watched union. Women in the lane had already buried two infants from his mother’s earlier births, and his father’s kin did not treat the marriage as fully proper. Dhaniyā, his mother, worked anyway: weeding and transplanting in other people’s fields, carrying water in a brass pot, and returning at dusk with mud on her calves. Bhola, his father, served attached to cultivating patrons—herding, hauling, and cutting fodder for a household that held the plough-oxen and the best grain stores. Haridāsa learned early that food moved through people, not only through fields.

His first memories included his sister Sītā, born in 1078, older and already tasked like an adult. She carried him on her hip while Dhaniyā took bundles of rice seedlings to the wet fields. Sītā pinched his ear when he wandered too close to the hearth and laughed when he copied grown men’s calls to the cattle. Padmā, born in 1079, had a steadier hand; she could talk to patrons’ women without lowering her eyes too far and she could return from a market day with salt and a little mustard oil without a quarrel. Between them, the girls held the house together while Bhola chased work and Dhaniyā carried both wage work and the household’s hunger.

Haridāsa ran thin and small, shorter than most boys his age. He also watched everything. He remembered which path stayed firm after a rain and which turned to sucking clay. He noticed which overseer carried a stick and which relied on insults. He could count bundles of fodder quickly and recall who had borrowed a sickle last week. This did not make him easy. Bhola would send him to the patron’s yard with a message, and Haridāsa would stop to watch dice men under a neem or to listen to a travelling singer at a market stall, and return late with the words scrambled. Bhola beat him for it. Haridāsa would then repeat the message perfectly to Dhaniyā, adding details he hadn’t been asked for. She scolded him while smiling once, then forced her face back to hard lines.

Ajjī Surasā, Bhola’s mother, lived long enough for Haridāsa to learn remedies and rules from her. She showed him how to grind neem leaves for a paste and how to keep a wound clean with warm water and ash. She insisted on offerings before certain work: a smear of vermilion on a boundary stone, a pinch of rice at a village shrine. When she died in 1103, Dhaniyā took over the small decisions with less ceremony and more sharpness.

Sītā died in 1096 at eighteen. The household had no money for a long cure; she had coughed through the hot season, then stopped rising from the mat. Haridāsa, thirteen, carried water and tried to keep her cup clean. After the cremation rites, he began working full days. He cut fodder, spread manure, and hauled sheaves at harvest for grain shares that barely lasted. He enjoyed the early hour before the sun rose hard, when men spoke quietly and the air held a little cold from the river. He also liked games of chance. He would sneak to the edge of a dice circle and wager a single cowrie or a handful of parched grain, then argue too long about whether a throw counted.

As a teenager he took a girl behind a stack of thatch after a festival evening. The next day he walked through the village with his chin up, and by the third day Dhaniyā had heard the talk. She slapped him once, not for the act itself but for bringing noise to a household already judged. He kept seeking bodies after that, quietly and when he could. He learned to read which women wanted him to go away and which did not mind his hand at their wrist for a moment too long.

Marriage came in 1103, arranged through kin and patrons who wanted fewer complications around an able-bodied young laborer. His wife was Lachhmī. She had strong forearms from pounding grain and a quick tongue that could shame him into silence when Bhola’s anger failed. In 1105 their first child, Gopāla, was born. Haridāsa took pride in the boy’s sturdy cry and in the way the child’s fingers locked around his thumb. He also wandered. He would agree to cut grass for one patron and then take a better offer at a neighboring homestead, returning home with a little extra grain and a new enemy. Lachhmī stopped asking him to keep promises in public; she asked in the hut, with the children listening.

A second son, Madhava, came in 1111, and a daughter, Kamala, in 1116. By then the region’s demands were tightening: more claims from temple-connected lands, more insistence on labor days when embankments needed work, more messengers passing through talking about new lords and new grants. Haridāsa did not follow court names, but he noticed when grain moved out of the village storehouses under guard.

The bad years began in 1116. Two weak monsoons left the rice thin and the lentils scarce. The patron household reduced grain payments. Haridāsa went to a grain lender and took sacks on harsh terms. By 1117 he owed more than he could clear with ordinary harvest labor. He pledged extra seasons of attached work and agreed that Lachhmī would weed and transplant more days for the patron’s women. The household ate boiled rice cut with wild greens and thin buttermilk when it existed. Haridāsa became mean at meals. If a neighbor offered advice, he snapped and walked off. At night he sometimes left the courtyard and did not return until dawn; once, he brought back a smear of scented oil on his neck and would not say where he had been.

The crisis eased in 1119 through sheer labor and a better harvest. The debt did not vanish; it loosened. In 1122, fever took Madhava at eleven. That same year Bhola died, worn down after the rains. Haridāsa argued over funeral costs, then sat outside the hut for a long time, picking at a rope end and saying nothing. Keshava, his younger brother, stepped forward for more of the hard work, and Balarāma, younger still, kept accounts in his head even without letters.

Padmā died in 1124. In the same year Haridāsa slipped while cutting wood and fodder and opened his lower leg. The wound gaped. It festered. Baidya Raghava packed it with a bitter paste and bound it with cloth strips, but the fever came anyway. Haridāsa lay for weeks, sweating through mats, trying to stand and failing. The household became a machine of caregiving: Lachhmī washed the wound, Dhaniyā brought warm water and scolded him for tearing the bandage, and Keshava carried his share of labor to keep patrons from taking their small space. Haridāsa hated being helped. He shouted at Kamala for spilling water and then apologized by giving her a roasted chickpea handful he had saved.

He walked again by 1125, stiff and cautious, and took lighter tasks when he could—watching cattle, carrying messages, standing in a line of men passing baskets of earth. Flooding hit hard in 1132. Water rose and chewed at an earthen bund that protected fields and a cluster of homes. Mukhiya Sāhadeva ordered a rotating crew. Haridāsa, calm and quick, placed men where the soil held and pushed the slow ones to fetch more baskets. He kept the breach from widening until the water slackened. Afterward, Sāhadeva spoke his name aloud in front of elders and made sure Haridāsa’s household received a better share of grain payments that season. Haridāsa enjoyed that more than food. He sat at the edge of the gathering with a cup of thin beer, listening while others tried to joke at him, and he let the jokes pass.

Old age came with joint-household obligations. Keshava lived under the same compound until his death in 1140. Dhaniyā, aging, needed help rising and needed someone to watch her when fevers came. Haridāsa took turns with Lachhmī and Kamala, and he did it without the earlier bitterness, because by then he was tired of fighting. Gopāla married and brought a daughter-in-law into the compound; Haridāsa kept a distance from the young woman and spoke to her only about work and food.

In 1145 Kamala died at twenty-nine, after an illness that left her too weak to stand. The rains came again. Haridāsa developed a harsh cough after working in wet clothes and sleeping near a smoky hearth. He kept going to the fields for several days, then stopped leaving the mat. Gopāla called Baidya Raghava, and the family fed Haridāsa warm water and thin rice broth, but the cough deepened and he died on November 22, 1145.

They carried his body to the cremation place by the water, laid him on a wood pyre, and performed the rites with ghee and a clay lamp; afterward, they offered rice balls and water for his ancestor path.
