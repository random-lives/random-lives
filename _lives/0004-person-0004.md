Lun was born in the wet forest far from the coast, in a band that moved between creeks and ridges in the country that later became Acre. The air stayed warm. Rain came hard for months at a time and turned the ground to slick clay. She was born at the end of the rains, on higher ground above a narrow stream. No one fixed the day with marks. People counted wet seasons and dry seasons and remembered lives by floods, hunger, and deaths.

Her first shelter stood in a small cluster centered on her mother’s kin. Her grandmother slept close enough that Lun heard her breathing change in the dark. An uncle kept his cutting stones and bone points in a bundle hung from a pole where children could not reach. The cluster carried weight. When two men argued over which arrow had brought down a monkey, Lun’s mother’s brother spoke once and the talk stopped before it turned into blows. They did not have more things than anyone else—woven bags, cords, stone flakes, wooden clubs, fire—but they had ties and people listened to them.

Lun was the first child. Four siblings followed. Three died at birth or soon after. The camp did not stop for long. There was water to haul and wood to cut and traps to check. The babies were taken away quickly and the adults went back to work. Lun watched faces go flat when the crying ended. She learned early that grief did not buy you rest.

Her father hunted whatever the forest gave: small deer, birds, rodents, monkeys. Her mother gathered, processed food, carried fuel, kept children from the water and the fire. Lun grew up inside that labor. She learned plants by smell and touch because she was forced to learn them. She also made the same mistakes again and again. She walked past a good vine, then insisted it was the one she had pointed out before. She lost things, then accused someone else of stealing them. When corrected, she did not bend. She argued until the other person stopped talking. If her grandmother said she tied a cord wrong, Lun retied it fast and tight, jaw clenched, refusing help and daring anyone to comment.

She talked over people. She stepped into adult talk without waiting. Around the fire, where decisions were made by speaking and interrupting, it mattered. She remembered stories word for word and delivered them with timing that held attention. Then she failed at the plain parts. Someone described a route to a fruit stand and Lun repeated the joke and missed the turn by the fallen tree.

By adolescence she tracked status and temper the way other children tracked game trails. She knew which older man would tolerate a question and which would strike for it. She pushed until she got a reaction and then pulled back just enough to avoid being hit.

She stole. A sharp flake. a coil of cord. A carved bone hook used for small fish. She hid them in leaf bundles behind her sleeping place. When the owner found the missing thing and asked, Lun denied it without blinking. When cornered, she turned it into a joke and mocked the person’s carelessness. People stopped lending to her. A woman refused to share cooked food with her through an entire wet season. An elder told her, in front of everyone, that she would eat last until she repaid what she took. Lun sat rigid through the talk, eyes hard, and then repaid every item because she could not stand being seen as punished. She did not apologize.

In her late teens the wet seasons rose higher than the elders remembered. Streams that were usually ankle-deep spread into the low forest and covered the paths. The band shifted camp to ridges where the ground drained. The move packed people closer together. Fuel stayed damp. Fire smoked and stung eyes. With everyone crowded and irritated, old slights turned into open fights.

Lun responded by making herself harder to corner. She ranged alone for long stretches of the day, staying inside the band’s home ground but away from its center. She focused on what one person could take without help: fish left behind in shrinking pools, small animals caught in simple snares, turtles found along flooded margins. She wove narrow basket traps from palm fiber and set them where water slowed. She carried her catch back early and laid it down where everyone saw. If anyone questioned her methods, she answered with contempt and volume. People talked about her because she forced them to.

Her standing rose, but it came with a price. She was productive and she was related to people who mattered, so she was tolerated. Children were warned away from her shelter. Adults kept their best tools out of her reach.

Men approached her as she grew into adulthood. She refused to pair off. The refusals were blunt. She laughed at one man in front of others and watched him swallow it. Another tried to bargain with gifts, offering a good stone core and promising meat. Lun took the stone and refused him anyway. The camp argued about it for days. An elder made her return it. Lun threw it onto the ground near the man’s feet and walked away. No one forgot.

She stayed childless because she chose to. She kept her time and her food for herself. She took help when she wanted it and withheld it when she did not.

As she aged, she became strict about her own gear. She checked cords, repaired baskets, sharpened flakes before dawn. She moved with little caution. She crossed slick banks without testing them. She waded into dark water while others watched for movement. When someone spoke of strangers’ tracks near a creek, Lun cut them off and called it fear.

At night gatherings she put herself forward. When visiting camps joined for a few nights, she drove the singing hard and loud, forcing the call-and-response to follow her pace. She liked making people keep time with her. When a younger woman fell behind, Lun stared until she corrected herself. After that, the younger woman stayed away from Lun and Lun did not care.

In her later years she built a small shelter of her own at the edge of camp. She stayed close enough to hear voices, far enough to control who came near. It gave her privacy. It also made her the first person met by anyone coming in from the forest.

Conflict in the region did not take the form of armies. It came as raids, revenge, and fights over water, groves, and insult. The forest held other bands and overlapping routes. Lun had given people reasons to hate her, and she did not take precautions.

In the weeks before she died, signs piled up. A distant column of smoke at the wrong time of day. Fresh tracks near a creek that no one in camp claimed. A trapline found disturbed and reset badly, as if someone had handled it in a hurry.

On a morning in the wet season, after night rain, Lun left before most people stirred. She went alone to check her snares and a basket trap set in a backwater pool. She carried a short wooden club and a coil of cord.

She followed a narrow path along a ridge and down toward the stream. Halfway down, three men stepped from behind young trees. Their faces were painted dark. Each held a heavy stick.

Lun spoke first, loud and fast. She did not greet them. She accused them of trespass as if volume could make it true. One man answered and kept coming. Lun swung and struck his shoulder. The blow landed and did not stop the other two.

A stick hit the side of her head. Her legs buckled. She tried to rise and a second blow caught her from behind. She fell forward into wet leaves and did not get up.

The men moved past her toward higher ground, staying low and quick. Rain returned before midday and washed the prints soft on the path where she lay.
