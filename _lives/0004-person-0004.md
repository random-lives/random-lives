Her name was Keriwa. It was an ordinary name in her band, spoken over her at birth by her mother’s mother, with ash smeared across her brow. She was born in the wet season on higher ground between larger rivers, in deep forest where the air stayed warm and insects were constant. Much later outsiders would give this place other names. For her it was creeks, palm stands, and old clearings returned to when the season turned.

She came into an extended cluster of shelters centered on her mother’s kin. Her parents slept near her mother’s mother and other relatives who shared work and food. No one owned more than another, but her mother’s line carried weight. When people argued over a fallen tree full of bees or a grove coming into fruit, older voices from that side settled it.

Keriwa was the first child. Four followed. Three died very early. One brother lived and grew old, and he would outlast her by decades. After the deaths the adults watched Keriwa closely. Waste brought anger. Carelessness brought sharp words. She learned to take what she was given and move on.

As a girl she was quick and loud. At night she pushed herself close to the storyteller, interrupting, forcing the tale forward. When an aunt tried to show her how to twist fiber for cord, Keriwa pulled too hard and snapped it. The aunt laughed. Keriwa threw the fibers into the dirt and walked away. Later she took them back and remade the cord alone, tighter and cleaner than before. People learned she would not accept correction, and that she would still finish the work.

The band moved when the food moved. They rebuilt shelters, left them, returned to old clearings when the forest offered again. There were no strangers living together in one place for long. Kin ties and memory held the group.

When Keriwa was in her late teens, the rains turned heavy and stayed. Water filled the low paths. Small streams ran loud and fast, and banks slumped into the current. Fishing where people usually stood became risky. Traps set at the edge of water vanished overnight. The camp shifted onto ridges where the ground held and smoke could rise.

Crowding brought friction. People stepped into each other’s routines. Food was talked about more than before. Keriwa used the pressure to separate herself. She began running her own traps farther out than most people went alone, setting snares where animals cut through the undergrowth and deadfalls where small game paused. She checked them before dawn and came back with rodents, birds, and sometimes a fish taken from still pockets left behind when floodwater dropped.

She did not say where she went. She brought meat and let people eat it, but she kept the routes to herself. It made others uneasy. Her grandmother called her aside once and scolded her in a low voice. Keriwa held her gaze until the older woman looked away.

As she grew, men watched her. A few asked to share a shelter and make a household that would link kin lines. She laughed at the first one, loud enough that others heard. She refused the next without explanation. The refusals stuck. She seemed to enjoy that they stuck.

She stayed inside the band’s home range and close to her mother’s people, but she kept distance inside the camp. She built her own small shelter at the edge of the clearing and kept her own hearth. She ate at other fires when she chose. When she didn’t, no one could force her.

Her skill made her useful. Her temper made her hard to live with. She gave food when it bought her peace or attention. She held back when she wanted something in return. She did not show fear when things went wrong.

In her thirties she slipped on a slick bank while hauling a fish trap. A broken branch opened her shin. Blood ran into the water. She climbed out, tore inner bark into a strip, and bound the cut tight. She limped back without calling out. The wound swelled and wept. An older man sat near her at night and sang while he shook a dry seed-pod rattle. Her mother crushed bitter leaves and pressed them to the heat in the flesh. Keriwa lay still and let them work. She did not thank them.

As she aged she became someone who could shift the mood of a gathering. At night she joined the singing and stamping on packed earth. Her voice carried and she could hold the rhythm without drifting. When visitors from a nearby camp arrived, she watched them with open suspicion and asked direct questions. She expected direct answers. Younger people copied her blunt way of speaking because it got results.

Years of high water changed the group’s circuit. People avoided the lowest ground when the rains came. Keriwa’s knowledge of back channels and high paths mattered. When a creek ran too fast she knew a calm pool beyond a bend. When a grove failed she knew another, and she announced it only after she had checked it herself. That habit angered people, but they tolerated it because she returned with food and because she did not fold under pressure.

In her early fifties the camp tightened. A neighboring group had been seen near a favored stretch of water, not passing through but staying. Fresh tracks crossed old paths. Voices dropped at night. The watchfire was fed longer. Keriwa kept her shelter where it was, out on the edge. Others told her to move closer. She refused. She liked space, and she liked being the one who went out first.

On a January morning, heavy air after rain, she left alone to check her snares and a fish trap she had set days earlier. She carried a wooden club and cord coiled over her shoulder. The ground gave underfoot.

In a narrow passage where the undergrowth thinned, she met people coming toward her. They were from the other group. There was no time to step aside and talk it out. Someone shouted her name like a charge.

Keriwa stepped forward. She swung first, aiming at a shoulder to break the arm. Another person struck her from the side with a club. The blow took her off balance. She dropped to her knees, tried to rise, and was hit again. The sound was brief and then swallowed by the forest.

They left her on the wet ground under broad leaves.

She died there, fifty-one years old. Rain started again before midday.
