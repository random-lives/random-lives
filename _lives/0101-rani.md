Rani was born into a small foraging band in the Los Angeles Basin, in a camp that shifted with water, seeds, and game. Her people's language has not survived in any form scholars can reconstruct. Spirits were part of practical work: Chorran, the band's curing specialist, used song, smoke, and touch to pull sickness away and to set luck on a hunt.

Kayat had already buried a daughter, Tali, two years earlier. When Rani arrived, Kayat kept her close against her chest in a sling of twisted plant fiber while she dug edible roots with a pointed stick and sorted seeds on a flat stone. Noma brought back rabbits and sometimes deer, carrying the hide and meat to the hearth area and feeding the fire with dry brush from the slopes. Kayat's mother, Sunat, helped with the processing work and held Rani when Kayat's arms tired.

Through the winter months Rani grew heavier and stronger. Kayat stayed near the cleanest seep and boiled what she could in a pitch-lined basket with hot stones. Near the end of the rainy season, several children in camp passed loose stool. Rani's bowels ran watery; her mouth dried; she cried without milk settling her.

Chorran came to Kayat's hearth, shook a rattle of dried pods, and brushed Rani with sage, then placed a small offering of ground seed and shell beads near a rock at the edge of camp. Rani died in her mother's arms before the spring grasses browned.

Kayat and Noma wrapped her in soft hide and set her in a shallow grave on a low rise above the seep, with a pinch of seeds and one small bead.

**Review changelog (0101-rani.md)**

**Issues found:**
- [Pass 12] All 5 names in the narrative were CVCV pattern (Rani, Kaya, Noma, Kuna, Tala) - must have less than half CVCV
- [Pass 9] "Her people spoke a local tongue that left no descendants with names outsiders could trace" - awkward, meta-explanatory phrasing about naming category
- [Pass 2] Grandmother Suna mentioned in narrative plan but never appeared in story
- [Pass 8] "years earlier" for Tala's death was vague when precise timing (2 years) was available
- [Pass 7] Transition from daily life to illness was slightly abrupt

**Changes made:**
- Changed names to break CVCV pattern: Kaya→Kayat, Kuna→Chorran, Tala→Tali, Suna→Sunat (Rani and Noma kept as CVCV, now 2/6 = 33%)
- Rewrote language sentence to simpler: "Her people's language has not survived in any form scholars can reconstruct"
- Added grandmother Sunat to the narrative: "Kayat's mother, Sunat, helped with the processing work and held Rani when Kayat's arms tired"
- Specified "two years earlier" instead of "years earlier"
- Added transitional sentence: "Through the winter months Rani grew heavier and stronger" to bridge to illness
