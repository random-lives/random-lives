# ethnicity: Indic agrarian Kalinga-related rural populace (Indo-Aryan-speaking, integrated
#   into early historic kingdoms and village agriculture)
# father_occupation: Herding/pastoral work as primary livelihood (cattle/goats), despite
#   artisanal-status household
# historical_context:
# - event: Periodic levy/requisition demands (grain, cattle, dairy, transport service)
#     tied to royal/elite movements and military needs, increasing burden on pastoral
#     households.
#   timing: Intermittent episodes, most likely ages 18–45 (51–78 AD)
# - event: Severe monsoon flooding/river spates in the Mahanadi system affecting paths,
#     markets, and disease risk (even if uplands avoid the worst floods, travel and
#     trade are disrupted).
#   timing: Occasional wet years; likely ages 15–50 (48–83 AD)
# - event: Endemic epidemic cycles of 'fevers' (malaria-like and other seasonal illnesses)
#     increasing mortality and reducing labor availability during bad years.
#   timing: Recurring, especially during/after monsoon seasons throughout life
# household_social_status: Village artisanal/service caste household (potter, smith,
#   carpenter, weaver, barber, etc.; modest/variable status)

#     role: father
#   - death_year: 33
#     name: Malli
#     narrative_role: Died in childbirth or soon after; Poda grows up with a felt
#       absence and a family narrative that he ‘cost’ her, which feeds guilt and later
#       self-soothing through drink.
#     role: mother

#     name: Podi
#     narrative_role: Daughter who marries out; remains emotionally important through

#     death_year: 62
#     name: Nonu
#     narrative_role: Second infant loss; reinforces household rituals focused on protection
#       from spirits and ‘bad air’ during the rains.
#     sex: M
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 27
#     connection: Father Bhola’s decline forces Poda into a caretaker role; it collides
#       with levy demands and pushes him to rely more on his younger brother Vasu and
#       wife Kanni for labor.
#     incident: elderly_parents
#   - age: 29
#     connection: Occurs during a cattle/goat drive on a route frequented by armed retainers;
#       reinforces his rule-bound caution and later informs his insistence on traveling
#       in groups.
#     incident: witnessed_atrocity
#   - age: 33
#     connection: Comes after years of growing alcohol dependence and stress from caregiving;
#       the dispute is mediated by uncle Kalu and village elders, setting terms that
#       later motivate Poda to rebuild reputation through reliable droving.
#     incident: physical_assault_perp
#   - age: 38
#     connection: After relocation, he leverages his reputation for punctuality and
#       honesty (despite illiteracy) to become a trusted drover; this partially repairs
#       damage from the assault incident.
#     incident: major_achievement
#   - age: 44
#     connection: Recurring wet-season fevers begin while he is still active in market-linked
#       herding; gradually shifts responsibility to son Dandu and narrows Poda’s world
#       to the village and nearby grazing.
#     incident: chronic_illness
#   - age: 52
#     connection: 'Wife Kanni’s prolonged respiratory illness becomes a turning point:
#       Poda’s conscientiousness expresses as intense daily care, temporarily reducing
#       drinking and travel.'

#     phase: Later childhood and adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-32
#     key_events:
#     - '51-52: Levy/requisition pressures increase during elite movements; Poda sometimes

#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 33
#     death_age: 60
#     death_year: 93
#     name: Poda
#     narrative_role: Protagonist; sixth child; grows into a steady but rigid herdsman
#       known for reliability yet periodically undermined by drink.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 36
#     death_age: 35
#     death_year: 71
#     name: Vasu
#     narrative_role: Younger brother and occasional companion on grazing trips; good-natured
#       foil to Poda’s rigidity; his death in mid-adulthood increases Poda’s workload
#       and drinking.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Limits economic experimentation and makes migration stressful; he
#       only relocates when kin pressure and pasture realities force it, and even then
#       he clings to old routines.
#     scene: He refuses to try a newly proposed grazing route and insists on the old
#       boundary markers and customary offerings before moving animals, warning others
#       not to trust unfamiliar headmen or forest paths.
#     timing: Adolescence through mid-adulthood (ages 15-45)
#     trait: Very low openness (8th percentile)
#   - consequence: Earns trust and steady commissions despite illiteracy; also makes
#       him rigid and harsh when others are careless.
#     scene: As a drover, he keeps a meticulous oral tally of animals, recounting horns
#       and markings at every stop, and wakes before dawn to check tether knots and
#       calves.
#     timing: Mid-adulthood (ages 35-50), strongest during major achievement period
#     trait: Very high conscientiousness (92nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Keeps him out of formal roles and dependent on relationships; increases
#       anxiety about being cheated, reinforcing his suspicion and preference for familiar
#       partners.
#     scene: He struggles to learn numerals/letters and relies on physical tokens (pebbles/knots)
#       and repeated recounting; he is easily misled by fast-talking traders unless
#       a sharper kinsman stands beside him.
#     timing: Young adulthood onward (ages 18+)
#     trait: Low intelligence (20th percentile)
#   - consequence: Builds a reputation that protects him from accusations and helps
#       him secure work after earlier violence.
#     scene: When an extra goat ends up mixed into his drove, he publicly returns it
#       rather than keeping it, accepting only a small share of curds as thanks.
#     timing: Major achievement period (ages 38-46)
#     trait: High honesty-humility (80th percentile)
#   - consequence: Contributes to the age-33 assault, strains marriage, worsens chronic
#       illness, and narrows his social support to kin who will tolerate him.
#     scene: After market days and during post-monsoon gatherings he binges on fermented
#       drink, misses early checks on the herd, and becomes irritable; during stress
#       (bereavement, conflict) the drinking turns from social to compulsive.
#     timing: Begins late adolescence (ages 16-18), peaks around ages 25-40, partial
#       improvement during wife-caregiving (ages 52-53), returns intermittently thereafter
#     trait: Substance-related disorder (harmful alcohol use/dependence)
#   - consequence: Lowers social confidence and pushes him toward dutiful, arranged
#       pathways; makes him sensitive to insult and more likely to respond aggressively
#       when shamed while drinking.
#     scene: He is mocked in youth for his face/skin and avoids crowded flirtation spaces
#       at festivals; marriage negotiations emphasize labor reliability and kin ties
#       rather than desirability.
#     timing: Adolescence and courtship years (ages 15-22)
#     trait: Very low physical attractiveness (1st percentile)
# number_of_children: '4'
# number_of_siblings: '6'
# occupation: Herdsman/pastoralist (cattle/goats; dairying/animal care as main work)
# religion: 'Household & village cults: offerings to local deities/spirits (grama-devata,

# structured_incidents:
# - event: After relocating within interior Kalinga, he built up a reliable mixed herd
#     and became the go-to drover for moving cattle and goats between his village and
#     a nearby periodic market, trusted to return animals and settle accounts fairly
#     even though he could not read or write.
#   reasoning: As a modest-status, illiterate rural herdsman, public recognition beyond
#     the village is unlikely; still, achieving local standing (successful herd management,
#     serving as elder/mediator) happens sometimes.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Ages 38–46 (circa 71–79 AD), sustained period
#   type: major_achievement
# - event: During a dispute over grazing rights and a missing goat, he struck a neighboring
#     herdsman with a staff and knocked him down, leaving the man badly bruised and
#     unable to work for several days; the matter was later settled by elders with compensation
#     in milk products and a small animal.
#   reasoning: Given confirmed perpetrator violence plus alcohol-use disorder and dispute-prone
#     herding life, the most likely manifestation is at least one serious fight/assault
#     (non-lethal).
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 33 (circa 66 AD), single event
#   type: physical_assault_perp
# - event: For years he suffered recurring bouts of fever with exhaustion and aching
#     joints that flared in the wet season, leaving him intermittently unable to walk
#     long distances with the herd and forcing his son to take over parts of the daily
#     grazing routine.
#   reasoning: Surviving to 60 in a high-pathogen setting makes at least one chronic
#     limitation (recurrent fevers, chronic respiratory issues, GI problems, or alcohol-related
#     liver/gastric disease) fairly common.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Ages 44–59 (circa 77–92 AD), recurring pattern
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: He spent months caring for his wife during a prolonged respiratory illness—arranging
#     herbal remedies, warm gruels, and help from kin for water and firewood while he
#     shortened grazing trips to stay near the house.
#   reasoning: Extended families regularly cared for the chronically ill at home; as
#     an older household head in a stem household, he would plausibly shoulder sustained
#     care responsibilities at least once.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Ages 52–53 (circa 85–86 AD), sustained period
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: When his father became frail and partially bedridden in old age, he took
#     responsibility for feeding, washing, and supervising him in the household compound,
#     while also ensuring the herd work continued through younger kin.
#   reasoning: With patrilocal norms, elder care often fell on co-resident sons; however
#     high mortality means many parents died before prolonged old-age dependency, making
#     this moderately likely but not dominant.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Ages 27–31 (circa 60–64 AD), sustained period
#   type: elderly_parents
# - event: 'While driving animals along a route used by armed retainers, he came upon
#     the aftermath of a raid: several dead villagers and a bound captive being beaten
#     during questioning; he watched from nearby with others before retreating to avoid
#     being seized.'
#   reasoning: Seeing killings during raids, reprisals, or skirmishes is plausible but
#     not guaranteed; many people experienced insecurity without directly witnessing
#     mass violence.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 29–30 (circa 62–63 AD), single event
#   type: witnessed_atrocity
---

Poda was born in the hot season of 33 AD in the uplands west of the Mahanadi, in the interior of Kalinga. The area answered to shifting regional rulers who drew taxes and service through local chiefs and armed retainers; for villagers, power arrived as collectors, escorts, and occasional raids. His people spoke an eastern Indo‑Aryan vernacular and kept household and village cults: a clay lamp at dusk, rice and flowers placed at a village shrine, and offerings to ancestors at the edge of the compound.

His mother, Malli, died in childbirth. The household did not break apart. It was a joint compound with his father Bhola, Bhola’s mother Masu, a co‑resident uncle Kalu, and children who came and went between chores. Poda’s first sister, Chelli, had died as an infant years earlier. Another sister, Ponna, stayed alive long enough to be remembered. When Poda was small, Ponna carried him on her hip while Masu cooked and Bhola drove goats out to the scrubby grazing. Ponna died in 35, after days of loose stool and then a fever that left her too tired to sit up. Masu washed the girl and set out a small mound of cooked grain and sesame near the ancestor place. After that, Masu watched Poda closely. She corrected how he held a bowl, how he stepped over the threshold, how he washed before offerings. She did not like noise.

Two older brothers were names in the household’s telling more than faces: Bakku, born in 30, had died at birth; the family kept his memory with a small yearly offering. Nonu, born in 28, lived long enough to teach Poda work. Nonu showed him how to read a herd without numbers: the kinked horn, the white patch above an eye, the goat that limped when it was tired. Nonu died in 42 at fourteen, after a wet season when men came back from the low ground shaking with chills. Poda stopped asking to sleep outside after that.

Dandula, born in 31, became the nearest thing to a mothering presence among the men. He was quick to seize a stick and quicker to take the first share of curds. He also made sure Poda ate when he forgot, and he pulled him back from a swollen stream once after a sudden spate. Their youngest brother, Vasu, arrived in 36. Vasu talked easily, laughed with the other boys, and copied bird calls while they watched goats. Poda stayed quieter. He liked the early part of morning when the air still held coolness and the animals moved without balking.

Bhola’s work kept the household fed. He herded cattle and goats, made ghee when milk was plenty, and traded hides and curds through village connections that also tied them to artisans and service groups. He expected his sons to follow his paths and his rules. Poda did. He rose before the others, checked the tether knots, and counted animals with pebbles in his palm. He could not learn letters when a wandering scribe’s helper offered to show them, and he could not hold long sums in his head without losing track. So he leaned on routines. The same route. The same resting stones. The same waterholes.

When Poda was in his late teens, levy demands arrived more often. Armed men with spears and short swords accompanied collectors. They took grain, milk products, and sometimes animals, and they required carts and men to move supplies. Poda learned to keep his head down when strangers asked questions. He also learned to drink. Fermented palm liquor appeared at festivals and after long days when men came back from obligations. He started taking more than his share, then sought it out even when there was no festival. It made him loud. It made him easy to anger when someone laughed at him.

Masu died in 52. The strictest voice in the compound vanished, and Poda began spending more evenings with a small group of men near the edge of the grazing, passing a pot and trading complaints about collectors and boundaries. A trader named Malu, who worked the periodic market a day’s walk away, sometimes sat with them and listened more than he spoke. Malu teased Poda about his careful knotting—“you tie as if the rope is your child”—and Poda bristled, then laughed because the line was true.

Bhola arranged Poda’s marriage in 53. His wife, Kanni, came from a nearby village and brought a small dowry of pots, cloth, and a brass bangle. She had a sharp eye for stores and a steady hand with a sick child. Poda did not charm her. He worked. He kept animals alive through bad forage. He returned on time when he said he would. Kanni accepted those things and built a household around them.

In 60 their first surviving son, Dandu, was born. Two years earlier and two years later, infants died—Tattu in 57 and Nonu in 62—each time after a brief sickness that turned the skin cold. Kanni’s grief came out as silence. Poda drank more after the first death, then tried to hide it after the second by staying out with the herd until night.

Bhola became frail in 60. His legs swelled, his breathing turned noisy, and he could not walk to the grazing. Poda took the role no one thanked him for. He washed his father, fed him thin gruel, and kept flies off his face with a whisk of leaves. Dandula and Kalu handled disputes and outside talk; Poda handled the body in the corner of the compound. When Bhola soiled himself, Poda cleaned it without comment, then washed and made a small offering at the ancestor place: water poured from a pot, a pinch of rice, a lamp lit low.

In 62, on a droving route used by armed retainers, Poda and another herdsman came upon the aftermath of a raid. Bodies lay where a hut had been. A captive, hands tied, knelt while a guard struck him and demanded names. Poda watched from behind scrub with others, then turned away. On the walk back he refused to camp near the road and insisted on traveling close to villages, even if it meant worse grazing.

Bhola died in 64. The compound reorganized under Kalu’s authority, and Poda began thinking about leaving the tight kin web that kept old grievances alive. Two years later, drink and pride collided. In 66 a neighbor named Jaya accused Poda’s group of taking a goat and pushing animals onto forbidden grazing. Words turned to shoving. Poda swung his staff and hit Jaya hard enough to knock him down. Jaya lay bruised and could not work for days. Elders gathered, with Nila speaking for the council and Kalu standing at Poda’s side. The settlement required compensation: a small animal and dairy goods delivered publicly. Poda complied. He did not apologize in words, but he walked the compensation to Jaya’s yard himself.

The assault narrowed his options at home. Vasu died that same year, 71, from a fever that started as a cough and ended with blood. The younger brother who had once copied bird calls while watching goats was gone. Dandula followed the next year, worn out at forty-one.

In 71 Poda moved with Kanni and Dandu to another village deeper within Kalinga, closer to a periodic market and better pasture. Malu had connections there and offered work droving cattle and goats between villages and market days. Poda could not write, so he kept his own tally by touch and sight. At every stop he lined animals up and recited markings aloud. People began handing him animals to move because they came back. He took satisfaction in returning a stray goat that had mixed into his drove; he made the owner identify it by a scar and then led it home.

From 77 onward, wet-season fevers returned each year. They left him exhausted, with aches in his joints that made long walking painful. Word came that Kalu had died back at the old compound in 78; Poda did not return for the rites, but he poured water at his own threshold and spoke the name aloud. After a hard monsoon he stayed closer to the village, sending Dandu on longer routes. He tried to keep control by laying out instructions: which waterhole first, which trees to avoid because spirits were said to sit there, which elder to greet with a gift of curds. Dandu followed most of it and ignored the parts he thought were fear.

Kanni fell ill in 85 with a cough that did not end. Her chest rattled. She could not keep food down. Poda stopped traveling. He arranged herbal decoctions from Budhi the healer, kept a pot of warm gruel ready, and paid neighbors with milk to fetch water and firewood. During those months he drank less, not from virtue but because his days were full and he feared being shamed if she died while he was drunk.

Their daughter, Podi, had been born in 60 and had married out. Dandu died in 88, taken by the same wet-season fevers that had plagued Poda for years. He was thirty-three. Poda sat by the body through the night and did not drink, then drank for three days after the cremation. With Dandu gone, the herd shrank to what an old man and his wife could manage with hired help.

Podi died in 89, leaving behind news carried by a messenger and then by Kanni's relatives. Two deaths in two years. Poda went quiet for days and then returned to the drinking pot.

In late 93, during the cooler months, Poda caught a respiratory sickness that tightened his chest and filled his throat. Kanni kept him inside the compound and fed him thin broth. Neighbors helped when she could not lift him. He died on December 7. The household washed his body, wrapped it in cloth, and carried it to a cremation place outside the village, placing a small offering of rice and flowers afterward at the ancestor spot in the yard.
