# historical_context:
# - event: Bombay Presidency plague waves and public-health controls (inspections, segregation/hospitalization,
#     travel checks), with spillover fear and disruption even outside core cities
#   timing: age 1–5 (1897–1902), especially winters
# - event: Monsoon variability leading to local crop shortfalls and high grain prices,
#     tightening food access for landless and casual-labor households
#   timing: intermittent across age 0–5 (1896–1902), strongest in poor monsoon years
# - event: Cholera risk tied to contaminated wells/streams during hot season and early
#     rains, sometimes in localized outbreaks
#   timing: recurrent seasonal risk; most likely to affect the area during hot season/monsoon
#     (any year, incl. 1902)
# - event: Colonial revenue and policing pressures (land revenue demands on cultivators;
#     enforcement and petty exactions affecting the rural poor indirectly through employers
#     and credit)
#   timing: continuous background during age 0–5
# - event: Lingering economic dislocation after the 1899–1900 Indian famine era in parts
#     of western/central India (labor scarcity/surplus shifts, elevated prices, disease
#     vulnerability)
#   timing: age 3–4 (1899–1901)

#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 3
#     connection: 'Place in late 1900 after a weak/erratic monsoon: transport hire on

#       also worsens nutrition and vulnerability to later illness.'
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 2
#     connection: Place in mid-to-late 1899 as a severe fever/diarrhea bout lasting

#       and setting up the later debt/food-shortage crisis.

#     - Born 17 Oct 1896 in a very poor Marathi+Gujarati-speaking nuclear household;

#       does domestic work plus seasonal farm labor.
#     - 'Early temperament: shy/withdrawn and easily distressed; strong attachment to
#       mother consistent with later separation-anxiety pattern.'
#     - 'Background disruptions: plague-era public health controls and fear in the wider
#       region; occasional checks/rumors about inspections when people travel to markets
#       or rail stops.'
#     phase: Infancy and toddlerhood in Mawal
#   - age_range: 2-4
#     key_events:
#     - Recurring childhood illness episodes (fever/diarrhea/respiratory bouts) that
#       he survives, leaving him more anxious and cautious.
#     - Monsoon variability raises grain prices; household food insecurity becomes more
#       acute.
#     - 'Family’s work rhythm: father away for stretches on carting/portering jobs;
#       mother juggling field labor with childcare.'
#     phase: Early childhood under strain
#   - age_range: 4-5
#     key_events:

Ghanshyam Vora was born on 17 October 1896 in Mawal, in the hills above the Konkan, under the British Bombay Presidency. His parents spoke Gujarati at home and Marathi outside, and they kept a small wooden shrine in their one-room house where his mother lit a lamp and offered water and a pinch of sugar to Krishna each morning.

His father, Raghunath Vora, earned cash on the road and rail corridor, taking loads on his back at the ghat and walking beside bullock carts when hired. His mother, Sita Vora, cooked, fetched water, and went out for seasonal field work when the village needed hands. They lived as a household of three. Ghanshyam clung to her sari when strangers entered the yard and cried when she stepped onto the path with her sickle.

In the winter of 1898, plague rules tightened in market towns. Men came through with questions and sharp orders about sickness and travel. Raghunath returned from a hire near the rail line and refused to let anyone touch the boy when they heard talk of inspection.

In 1899, Ghanshyam fell ill with a long fever and loose stools. Sita stayed home from the fields to cool him with wet cloth and spoon him watered gruel. When he could stand again he still avoided the other children. If they reached for his clay toy cart, he snatched it back and shoved.

The monsoon failed in 1900. Grain prices climbed. Carting work fell off on the ghat road and Raghunath went weeks without hire. Sita went to Kalyanji Sheth’s shop and took grain on credit, promising payment after the next season. Meals shrank to thin millet gruel and a little onion.

In June 1902 the rains brought dirty runoff into the stream below the settlement. Ghanshyam began passing watery stools and vomiting the same day. Sita carried him to Bai Sakharam for herbs and prayers, then to the nearest compounder. He died on 1 July 1902.
