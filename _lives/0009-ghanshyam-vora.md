# historical_context:
# - event: Bombay Presidency plague waves and public-health controls (inspections, segregation/hospitalization,

#   timing: age 1–5 (1897–1902), especially winters
# - event: Monsoon variability leading to local crop shortfalls and high grain prices,
#     tightening food access for landless and casual-labor households
#   timing: intermittent across age 0–5 (1896–1902), strongest in poor monsoon years
# - event: Cholera risk tied to contaminated wells/streams during hot season and early
#     rains, sometimes in localized outbreaks
#   timing: recurrent seasonal risk; most likely to affect the area during hot season/monsoon
#     (any year, incl. 1902)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: After a bad monsoon year, carting work on the ghat road fell off and his
#     father went weeks with little hire; the family took grain on credit from a local
#     baniya and began skipping meals to stretch it.
#   reasoning: The household is already categorized as very poor with food insecurity;
#     transport day-labor plus seasonal farm labor is volatile and vulnerable to illness
#     and price shocks.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: circa age 3–4 (late 1899 to mid-1901)

Ghanshyam Vora was born on October 17, 1896, in Mawal, in the hills and fields above the road that climbed toward the ghats outside Pune. The area sat under the British Raj in the Bombay Presidency, with police stations, tax records, and inspectors. In his house, people spoke Marathi with neighbors and Gujarati between themselves. A small brass lamp sat on a shelf, and his mother lit it at dusk and set a pinch of sugar before a framed image of Krishna.

His father, Ramesh Vora, carried loads and drove a bullock cart when merchants needed goods hauled between villages and the rail-side markets. His mother, Sita, left before sunrise in peak seasons to weed and cut on other people’s fields, then came back to grind grain, fetch water, and keep the cooking fire alive. Ghanshyam stayed close to her sari end. When she tried to leave him with a neighbor, he clung and yelled until she gave in and took him along. He watched other children play in dust and waited, stiff and quiet, until someone bumped him. Then he shoved back hard.

In the winters, rumors came down the road with the carriers: plague in the cities, men taken away to hospitals, houses searched. Once, officials and local men walked the lanes, asking questions and looking at bodies for swellings. Sita kept Ghanshyam inside and washed the threshold.

After the bad monsoon, grain prices rose. Ramesh stood by the road with other cartmen and got turned away. Weeks passed with little hire. He went to a baniya’s shop and took grain on credit. Sita began to thin the gruel and put fewer rotis on the leaf plate.

In June 1902, the rains began. Water ran brown in the ditches, and the well mouth stayed crowded. Ghanshyam drank and then began passing watery stools. Sita carried him to the village healer for powders, then to a small dispensary along the road. By July 1, 1902, he was dead.
