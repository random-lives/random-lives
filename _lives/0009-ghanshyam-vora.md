# historical_context:
# - event: Bombay Presidency plague waves and public-health controls (inspections, segregation/hospitalization,

#   timing: age 1–5 (1897–1902), especially winters
# - event: Monsoon variability leading to local crop shortfalls and high grain prices,
#     tightening food access for landless and casual-labor households
#   timing: intermittent across age 0–5 (1896–1902), strongest in poor monsoon years
# - event: Cholera risk tied to contaminated wells/streams during hot season and early
#     rains, sometimes in localized outbreaks
#   timing: recurrent seasonal risk; most likely to affect the area during hot season/monsoon
#     (any year, incl. 1902)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: After a bad monsoon year, carting work on the ghat road fell off and his
#     father went weeks with little hire; the family took grain on credit from a local
#     baniya and began skipping meals to stretch it.
#   reasoning: The household is already categorized as very poor with food insecurity;
#     transport day-labor plus seasonal farm labor is volatile and vulnerable to illness
#     and price shocks.
#   tier: 1

Ghanshyam Vora was born on October 17, 1896, in Mawal, in the hills and fields above the rail line and ghat road between Pune and the coast. The village sat under the British administration of the Bombay Presidency. His parents spoke Marathi with neighbors and Gujarati at home, kept a small shrine in the house, and lit a lamp for Vishnu each evening when oil could be spared.

His father, Ramesh Vora, earned wages where he could on the road: walking beside bullock carts, lifting bales, carrying loads up steep stretches, taking whatever hire a day offered. His mother, Jivi, went out for farm work when landholders needed hands, then returned to grind grain, fetch water, and cook. They lived as a small household, just the three of them.

Ghanshyam stayed close to Jivi. He cried when she stepped away to draw water. When a neighbor tried to coax him outside, he backed into the doorway and held his breath until she returned. At night he woke quickly at small sounds and called out, then fell quiet when he felt her hand on his head. He did not run with the other children for long. He watched carts and bullocks from the side of the track, shifting pebbles into lines and counting under his breath.

Winter brought talk of plague and the government’s searches in towns. People argued at the tea stall about hospital carts and inspectors. Travelers were watched on the road. In the bad monsoon years around 1899 and 1900, grain cost more and carting work fell off. Ramesh came home with empty hands for weeks. Jivi went to a baniya for grain on credit, and she thinned the porridge and cut the day’s rotis smaller.

Ghanshyam had long spells of sickness that left him listless and thin, then he would sit up again and follow his mother around the room. In late June 1902, after the early rains, he began passing watery stool. Jivi carried him to the well and tried to give him water and salt. He cramped and vomited. On July 1, 1902, he died at home in Mawal.
