Tari was born in midwinter in a small forager band living in the wooded uplands above the river valleys of what is now inland Galicia. No chiefs or towns directed them. Families moved between familiar camps, spoke an old local tongue, and treated certain springs, boulders, and lone trees as places that could help or harm.

Her mother Ena worked close to the hearth, splitting dried meat and pounding gathered seeds and nuts on a flat stone, turning them into meal for stews. Her father Arko ranged out from camp with other men, hunting and carrying back wood, hide, and bone to be worked into points and handles. The shelter held smoke, damp wooly skins, and stored bundles hung from poles. Ena kept Tari wrapped against her body, shifting her from hip to breast, then laying her on folded furs within reach of the warmth stones.

After a few weeks, Tari’s body failed in a way no charm corrected. Ena tied a strip of cord around Tari’s wrist and rubbed it with ash from the hearth. Arko went to a seep where water ran cold from rock and left a pinch of meal and a sliver of fat on a flat stone, then pressed his palm to the wet rock.

Tari died before the first spring plants opened. They placed her in a shallow pit at the edge of camp, lined it with dry leaves, and set the cord beside her before covering the earth.
