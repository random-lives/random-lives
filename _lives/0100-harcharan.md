#     sex: M
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 38
#     connection: During early signs of financial strain and input-cost pressure, he
#       starts taking water outside his turn and cutting fodder/wood from common land;

#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   - age: 40
#     connection: In the middle of a fertiliser-and-irrigation-dependent season, theft
#       of a pump/tool component forces an urgent replacement purchase, worsening cashflow
#       and feeding resentment that later justifies his own petty rule-breaking.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 45
#     connection: Debt spiral peaks after repeated borrowing for inputs plus medical/household
#       costs; family disputes intensify, and elders push to mortgage or sell part of

#       social life.
#     phase: 'Midlife: pressure, alcohol, and debt'

#     narrative_role: A small child remembered through stories and a few kept objects;
#       her loss keeps the mother anxious and quick to consult healers.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Occasional gains (trying a new crop/input early) but also wasted
#       money on half-understood schemes and susceptibility to persuasive ‘experts’
#       and sant-culture promises.
#     scene: He becomes fascinated by new seeds, pumps, and the talk of distant places;
#       he eagerly listens to traveling preachers and mechanics, asks questions, and
#       experiments with small changes on the farm even when elders say ‘do it the old
#       way.’
#     timing: most visible from teens through 30s (late 1950s-1970s), resurfaces in
#       religious shift (1990s-2000s)
#     trait: Very high Openness (98th percentile)
#   - consequence: Weak schooling outcomes, chronic household criticism, and amplified
#       debt during the crisis because records and planning are poor.
#     scene: He forgets repayment dates, misplaces papers, arrives late for irrigation
#       turns, and leaves tasks half-finished—then tries to talk his way out of trouble
#       with relatives or lenders.
#     timing: school years (1950s-60s) through midlife (1980s-90s)
#     trait: Low Conscientiousness (25th percentile)
#   - consequence: Builds wide social network useful for farming logistics, but also
#       increases exposure to drinking circles and public arguments.
#     scene: He is the loud voice at weddings and markets, makes quick friendships at
#       the mandi/tea stall, and is often the one sent to negotiate—sometimes using
#       charm, sometimes escalating into boasting and quarrels after drink.
#     timing: young adult through midlife (1960s-1990s)
#     trait: High Extraversion (73rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Poor financial decisions, dependence on brothers/agents, and increased
#       conflict when outcomes go bad.
#     scene: He can read simple signs and bills but struggles with calculations, contracts,
#       and the compounding logic of interest; he relies on others to interpret paperwork
#       and is vulnerable to being misled.
#     timing: becomes most consequential during Green Revolution credit era and debt
#       years (1970s-1990s)
#     trait: Low Intelligence (13th percentile) affecting functioning
#   - consequence: Family trust erodes, contributes to debt/asset pressure, and nudges
#       the household toward the derā/sant seeking ‘reform’ and healing.
#     scene: 'Binge episodes around market days or after setbacks: he comes home loud,
#       spends more than planned, misses morning work, and argues with his wife/brother;
#       then has remorse and periods of cutting back.'
#     timing: emerges late 20s-30s, peaks during economic crisis (mid-1970s through
#       1990s), partial reduction in 2000s with health decline
#     trait: Alcohol use disorder (mild to moderate)
# number_of_children: '2'
# number_of_siblings: 10+
# occupation: Cultivator/peasant-proprietor farmer (works and helps manage family land;
#   hires labor seasonally, uses modern inputs over time)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: A thief (likely from outside the immediate kin network) stole farm inputs
#     and small equipment—such as a pump part, tools, or a sack of fertiliser—from the
#     fields/khuh area at night, forcing him to replace it mid-season at higher cost.
#   reasoning: As a landowning farmer with equipment/livestock/cash-crop income, he
#     would be a plausible target for theft or fraud (crop/input scams, tool/livestock
#     theft), though village social control can reduce repeat victimization.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: late 30s to early 40s (c. 1983–1988); single event
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: During a tight season, he quietly diverted a small amount of canal/tubewell
#     water outside his allotted turn and cut some fodder/wood from common land without
#     permission—an act treated locally as petty theft but often handled informally.
#   reasoning: Small-scale “everyday illegality” in agrarian settings (pilfering produce,
#     minor tax evasion, informal diversion of shared resources) is fairly common; his
#     lower conscientiousness increases risk, but being a landholder reduces need for
#     overt theft.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: mid 30s to mid 40s (c. 1980–1990); recurring pattern
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime
# - event: After a combination of crop-price fluctuations and mounting expenses (medical
#     costs and household obligations), he took high-interest informal loans and fell
#     into a debt spiral; family disputes over spending and alcohol led to pressure
#     to sell or mortgage a portion of land.
#   reasoning: Despite landownership, Punjab farmers can face debt spirals from crop
#     failures, medical costs, weddings, or alcohol-related spending; his adult standing
#     is already described as somewhat reduced by debts/conflict.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: early 40s to early 50s (c. 1986–1996); sustained period
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: He shifted from occasional gurdwara visits to mostly following a local sant/derā
#     tradition for prayers and remedies—attending deras and seeking blessings for health
#     and family problems—while still identifying as Sikh and participating in major
#     Sikh festivals.
#   reasoning: Low-intensity Sikh practice can drift over time, but outright conversion/apostasy
#     is uncommon in this demographic; most remain within Sikh identity even if observance
#     changes.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: late 40s to late 50s (c. 1994–2004); sustained period
#   type: religious_change

Harcharan Singh was born on 2 March 1945 in Sahdra village near Balachaur, in the last years of British rule. His family were Punjabi-speaking Sikhs who worked their own land in a joint household, the kind of courtyard where several cooking fires ran at once and everyone knew who had eaten and who had not. Men went out to the fields at first light; women carried water and fodder and still went to weed and harvest when the work demanded it.

He entered a house that had already buried two children. His parents had buried a baby girl, Harbans Kaur, in 1941, and then their first boy, Jarnail Singh, in 1943. Surinder Kaur, born in 1943, grew up as the eldest living child, old enough to remember the hush that fell when sickness came. Harcharan was the fourth child and the second living one. A tall boy later, long-limbed and quick to grin, he learned early to win attention by talking. He liked sitting near his paternal grandmother, Bibiji Harnam Kaur, as she rolled rotis and told stories in Punjabi mixed with the hill-side speech she had picked up in her youth. He repeated lines back to her in her own phrasing, making her laugh.

Partition arrived when he was two. In Sahdra it came as families on the road, men speaking in fast, tight voices, and changes in records and holdings that made his father, Sohan Singh, spend evenings with other landholders, comparing papers and arguing about boundaries. Harcharan’s earliest memories included strangers at the gurdwara courtyard eating langar, the steel plates washed in a line at the handpump, and his mother Kishan Kaur pulling him away from the edge of crowds.

More children came. Gurmeet Kaur was born in 1947, the year of Partition. Baljit Singh arrived in 1949, Dalbir Kaur in 1951, Avtar Singh in 1953, Satpal Singh in 1956, Manjit Kaur in 1958, and the last, Ranjit Kaur, in 1960. Ten living children in all, though two had died before Harcharan was born, and more loss would follow.

The joint household was run by elders. Baba Kartar Singh, his paternal grandfather, held the final word in disputes between brothers. Chacha Mohinder Singh lived in the same compound with his wife; their children ran through the same lanes and fought over the same toys. When Harcharan was sent to school, Master Jiwan Lal taught him to trace Gurmukhi letters on a slate. He learned enough to read simple signs and to write his name, but he drifted. He skipped when a fair came to a nearby town, or when a cousin promised a ride on a cart. His father punished him with extra work rather than blows: hauling manure, carrying water to the vegetable patch, standing guard in the fields at night.

By his teens he spoke easily with men at the mandi and with travelers who came to repair pumps or sell tools. He liked new objects. A bicycle bell. A radio that caught songs and news when the weather was clear. He listened to talk about tubewells and new wheat seed and repeated it at home, half understanding it and enjoying the sound of it. Surinder Kaur, already helping their mother in the fields, pulled him back when he got too mouthy in front of elders.

The mid-1960s brought changes that reached even Sahdra. New varieties of wheat, bags of fertiliser, and the promise of higher yields made the family take loans and plan around irrigation turns. Harcharan enjoyed the bustle. He went with his father to the mandi and liked the tea stalls, the jokes, the smell of fried pakoras, the quick deals spoken over stacks of grain. The Indo-Pak war of 1965 brought blackout orders and tense nights; his elders talked of troop movements and price uncertainty. He remembered the quiet after sunset, lamps shaded, and the way even loud men lowered their voices. That same year, Ranjit Kaur, the youngest sister, died at five years old—a fever that did not break.

Sohan Singh arranged Harcharan’s marriage in 1968. Rajinder Kaur came to the house with her dowry trunks and brass utensils, and she learned the rules of the compound quickly. Harcharan treated her with warmth in public and impatience in private when she asked about money or routines. Their daughter, Jaspreet Kaur, was born in 1970. He carried her around the courtyard and showed her off at the gurdwara, but he also vanished for long chats at the tea stall when she cried at night and Rajinder needed help.

In 1971 the second war came and passed; by then he was a young man with responsibilities on the land. In 1973 Rajinder delivered a son, Gurpreet Singh, who died before he had properly settled into the house. Women whispered about nazar and weakness. Kishan Kaur began keeping more remedies close—warming ajwain in ghee for stomach complaints, tying small protective threads for children—and she watched the men’s drinking more sharply after that.

Alcohol entered Harcharan’s routine through companionship. Banta Singh, a neighboring farmer, liked to stop at a roadside dhaba after mandi days. A few pegs became a habit. Harcharan was loud and charming after drink, quick to start a song and quick to argue if he felt mocked. He came home late, then missed morning tasks. He promised to cut back. He did, for stretches, then returned to it when the fields demanded costly inputs or when someone in the family fell sick.

Deaths in the family piled up. Baba Kartar Singh died in 1968, and Bibiji Harnam Kaur in 1976. The loss that hit hardest was Manjit Kaur in 1975, dead at seventeen. The household treated it as a wound that never closed. Harcharan grew more irritable after that, and more willing to spend on anything that promised relief: a new pump part, a different seed, a medicine bottle from a town clinic.

In 1983, with input costs rising and water turns tight, he began cutting corners. He took water outside the allotted time when he thought no one was watching and sent a boy to cut fodder from common land. It was the sort of petty rule-breaking that often stayed within village handling—warnings, arguments, a shouted threat at the well. He did it more than once, especially after a bad week.

Five years later, in 1985, someone stole from him. A sack of fertiliser and a metal part from near the khuh vanished overnight. He walked the field edge at dawn, swearing under his breath, then went to the market and paid extra to replace what he needed in the middle of the season. He carried the purchase home himself, refusing help, and he brought his anger into the courtyard. That theft became one of his justifications whenever a brother accused him of taking too much water.

Debt became the main problem in 1990. Crop prices dipped while expenses rose: clinic bills from Dr. Mehta in the nearby town, household obligations, and money that bled away at the dhaba. He borrowed on high interest through the mandi system, with Rakesh Kumar, a commission-agent clerk, doing the calculations on paper Harcharan could not fully follow. When repayment dates arrived, he argued, begged for time, and then shouted at home. Baljit Singh wanted strict control of spending. Avtar Singh, the more disciplined younger brother, talked about planning and records. Dalbir Kaur, married out but still close to the family, passed news between households and sometimes sent quiet help through her husband's earnings. Harcharan insisted he had everything in his head, then forgot what he had promised.

The early 1990s also carried Punjab’s atmosphere of checkpoints and fear. He kept trips to town short when news of violence spread. Some evenings he stayed home, listening to the radio, but the strain still drove him back to drink. In 1996 the family mortgaged part of the land to steady the situation. The dispute over it ran through the household for years.

In 1997, as his health began to falter—blood pressure that made him dizzy, aches that did not ease—his mother and wife followed Sardarni Shanti Kaur to a local sant’s gathering at a derā. Harcharan went at first to keep peace at home. He ended up liking the attention and the plain routines: shoes left outside, a quick bow, prasad in the palm, the sant’s talk about controlling drink and settling family quarrels. He still called himself Sikh and went to the gurdwara on gurpurabs, but the derā became the place he visited when he felt trapped. He brought home packets of ash and sweetened water said to help with illness, and he insisted Rajinder keep them near the kitchen shelf.

Sohan Singh died in 1998, ending the last unquestioned authority over the brothers. The family rearranged responsibilities and boundaries. Harcharan kept farming but with less stamina. Kishan Kaur died in 2007, and Chacha Mohinder Singh followed in 2010. Surinder Kaur died in 2017, and Avtar Singh in 2022; Gurmeet Kaur followed in 2023. Those losses narrowed his circle. His daughter Jaspreet, grown and married, managed more of his medical appointments and brought medicines from town. Satpal Singh, the youngest surviving brother, helped with hospital trips and paperwork when Harcharan's health worsened.

When COVID-19 arrived, he stayed close to home. The gurdwara langar stopped for a time, weddings shrank, and the village became quiet in an unfamiliar way. He listened to news on the phone a nephew set up for him, pretending he understood everything and then asking the same question again.

By late 2025 Harcharan is eighty. He sits on a woven cot in the courtyard after the morning tea, rubbing oil into his knees before he tries to walk. He reads a simple headline when someone hands him a paper, then passes it on. Some days he helps with small tasks—sorting seed, watching a grandchild tie a bundle—then he drifts into conversation with whoever passes the gate. He still visits the derā when a relative can take him, and he still goes to the gurdwara on the big days, keeping his head covered and his talk low, letting others handle the accounts.
