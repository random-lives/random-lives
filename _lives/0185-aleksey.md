#     narrative_role: Younger brother who dies in infancy; reinforces the household
#       sense that survival is uncertain and that women’s labor and prayer must be constant.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Channeled into the simplest labor tasks; vulnerable to being mocked,
#       shorted in exchanges, and blamed when work brigades fall behind.
#     scene: As a boy he cannot reliably learn letters or count measures; as an adult
#       he misunderstands written/official instructions and relies on others to interpret
#       quotas or orders.
#     timing: childhood onward (most visible at ages 6–12 and again during collectivization
#       and occupation years)
#     trait: Intellectual disability (lifelong cognitive/adaptive impairment)
#   - consequence: Contributes to 'lower standing' reputation; arguments with wife and
#       reprimands from brigade leaders; increases household risk during scarcity.
#     scene: Frequently forgets to latch gates, misplaces tools, and misses agreed times;
#       after drinking/visiting he neglects chores until others intervene.
#     timing: adolescence through adulthood (ages 12–47)
#     trait: Very low conscientiousness
#   - consequence: Adapts slowly to kolkhoz procedures and new expectations; relies
#       on kin to guide him, deepening dependence.
#     scene: Distrusts new farming rules and resists unfamiliar methods; repeats old
#       sayings, prefers known routines, and avoids novel ideas or distant places.
#     timing: especially during collectivization and later Soviet campaigns (ages 30–42)
#     trait: Very low openness
#   - consequence: Maintains social ties that sometimes help the family (borrowing/reciprocity)
#       but also exposes him to gossip and to being talked into risky minor rule-breaking.
#     scene: Talkative at work breaks and village gatherings; seeks company, tells repetitive
#       stories, and is drawn into group moods (songs, arguments, rumors).
#     timing: young adulthood through war years (ages 20–47)
#     trait: High extraversion
#   - consequence: Protects him from escalations into serious crime/violence; however,
#       it also makes him easier to exploit or scapegoat in disputes.
#     scene: Avoids grand claims, shares small food with poorer neighbors when he can,
#       and admits mistakes rather than inventing elaborate lies.
#     timing: throughout adulthood (ages 20–47)
#     trait: High honesty-humility
# number_of_children: '2'
# number_of_siblings: '6'
# occupation: Agricultural laborer / collective farm worker (kolkhoznik) doing general
#   fieldwork and livestock tasks
# religion: Orthodox practice centered on home icons/prayer + major feast days and life-cycle
#   rites; limited routine churchgoing (esp. after 1917/1930s)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During the hungry war years, someone from a neighboring village (or a passerby)
#     stole stored potatoes and a few tools from the shed/yard while the household was
#     out on kolkhoz work; the loss meant weeks of tighter rations and borrowing from
#     kin.
#   reasoning: Theft of food, livestock, tools, and clothing was common in poor rural
#     settings, especially during famine/war scarcity; even smallholders/kolkhoz households
#     could be targeted.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: late 1942 to winter 1943 (age 44–45)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: He periodically brought home small amounts of kolkhoz grain or fodder hidden
#     in clothing/sacks after fieldwork to keep his household fed and a cow/chickens
#     alive, treating it as survival rather than 'theft' in a time of requisitions and
#     shortage.
#   reasoning: In the kolkhoz era, petty appropriation ('taking' grain/wood), poaching,
#     or informal rule-breaking to survive was widespread, and extreme poverty increases
#     incentive; his honesty-humility dampens but does not remove the risk.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: 1933–1934 and again 1942–1944 (ages 35–37 and 44–46)
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime
# - event: While hauling logs/wood in winter, he slipped and the load shifted, crushing
#     his lower leg/ankle; it healed poorly without proper treatment, leaving him with
#     a permanent limp and reduced capacity for heavy fieldwork.
#   reasoning: Permanent disability (limp from fracture, significant vision/hearing
#     loss, loss of fingers/hand) occurred but was less frequent than temporary injury
#     or chronic pain; still plausible with farm/forest work and limited medical care.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: winter 1938–1939 (age 41)
#   type: acquired_disability
# - event: During the German advance and subsequent occupation/partisan fighting in
#     the Bryansk area, his household endured searches and requisitions, nights spent
#     hiding in the forest from raids, and periodic nearby gunfire and burnings in surrounding
#     hamlets.
#   reasoning: Bryansk region saw intense WWII front/occupation/partisan activity and
#     wartime requisitioning; even without permanent migration, civilians often experienced
#     occupation, raids, bombing, forced labor demands, or temporary flight.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: summer 1941 to autumn 1943 (age 43–45)
#   type: civilian_war_exposure

Aleksey Fyodorovich was born on December 9, 1897, in a small village in Bryansk province of the Russian Empire, in a Great Russian Orthodox peasant household. His family spoke the local Russian rural dialect, kept icons in the main room, and measured the year by fasts and feast days even when the priest came less often than people wanted.

He arrived as the sixth child. Ivan, the eldest brother, was already big enough to be useful in the yard; Anna, the older sister, helped his mother, Praskovya, with washing and bread. Two sisters—Mariya and Darya—had died before Aleksey was born, and the women in the house treated infants carefully, hurrying baptism and watching coughs. Stepan, born the year before Aleksey, stayed close to him as they grew. In 1899 a last baby, Vasiliy, lived only briefly.

The house held more than parents and children. Aleksey’s paternal grandfather Maksim ruled the household table and the division of tasks, and his grandmother Ulyana kept the stove, the hens, and the small routines of prayer. Ulyana taught Aleksey to cross himself before eating and to repeat short prayers by memory in front of the corner icons—Christ Pantocrator and the Mother of God—while she lit a stub of candle on big days. Aleksey learned those words the way he learned a song. He struggled with anything that required counting or careful steps. If sent to fetch nails, he returned with the wrong size. If told to bring two buckets, he brought one and a broken yoke. Maksim’s patience ran out quickly; Fyodor, Aleksey’s father, corrected him with blunt words and a push toward work that could be seen and checked.

A few winters after the 1905 unrest farther away, a teacher tried to gather village children for lessons. Aleksey went for a short stretch. He could not hold letters in his mind. He stared at the slate and copied marks without understanding, then forgot them by the next day. When he was pulled back into chores, no one argued. He carried water, fed the cow, watched geese, and trailed after Stepan to the hayfield. Stepan talked for both of them, quick with village jokes and daring enough to climb where Aleksey would not.

Maksim died in 1908. The household shifted. Fyodor's word became final, and Ivan's work began to count as a man's work. Aleksey fell into a place where he was useful but watched. He could mow if someone set him at the edge of a strip and pointed the direction. He could stack sheaves. He liked threshing time because it brought company: men in a line, boots on the barn floor, talk running ahead of the flails. He laughed easily and repeated the same story twice without noticing.

The years between 1909 and 1913 passed in the same pattern: spring plowing, summer haymaking, autumn threshing, winter wood-hauling. Ivan married and brought his wife into the household. Anna left to marry a man in a village three versts away. Aleksey stayed, doing the same tasks, never advancing to the skilled work that Fyodor assigned to Ivan. He was sixteen when the war began.

The war in 1914 pulled at the village even before soldiers marched through it. Prices rose, iron goods grew scarce, and the men talked about lists and summonses. That same year Stepan died at eighteen. A sickness took him quickly after a short time in bed. Aleksey did not take the loss with words; he walked more often to the edge of the yard and stood there, looking toward the fields where Stepan had worked. Fyodor drove him back to tasks, and Aleksey did them, clumsy and obedient.

Ulyana died in 1916. Praskovya wrapped the grandmother’s body and arranged the home prayers with the little she could manage as public church life became less certain. Aleksey kept the habit of crossing himself at the icon corner and touching the wooden frame when he passed, even when he could not explain why.

The upheaval from 1917 onward arrived as men with rifles, new orders, and demands for grain. Aleksey understood little of politics. He understood fear in voices and the need to do what older men said. Ivan handled the bargaining and the arguments. Aleksey carried sacks, held a horse’s head, and followed instructions. When the village talked in whispers, he repeated those whispers too loudly until Anna or his mother hushed him.

In 1922, with the fighting quieter and the new authorities settled enough to issue papers, Aleksey married Ekaterina from a nearby village. She was steady and direct, and she could read enough to recognize a name. They lived in a separate izba on the same plot as his parents, sharing labor with Fyodor and Praskovya. Ekaterina's older sister Galina, widowed young, sometimes stayed with them to help. Ekaterina kept a small icon of Saint Nicholas and the Mother of God on a shelf with a cloth under them. Aleksey still prayed by rote. He liked the simple part of feast days: warm kasha with butter when there was butter, a cup of tea sweetened with a spoonful of jam, singing that ran late into the night. He made friends quickly. A neighbor named Pavel became his drinking companion when there was vodka to be had, and Aleksey’s loud talk and easy laughter drew other men to the bench outside the house in summer evenings.

Ekaterina did the planning. Aleksey forgot to latch gates and once left a scythe in wet grass to rust. They argued about it, short and sharp. He would sulk, then turn talkative again, making a show of helping, sweeping the floor with too much force, splashing water from the bucket. When their son Nikolay was born in 1926, Aleksey lifted the baby high for others to see and told the same joke to three different visitors. Ekaterina managed the household, milking the cow before dawn and making sure Nikolay was fed before anyone else.

A daughter, Tatyana, was born in 1929 and died the same year. Ekaterina sat by the stove for days with a set face, and Aleksey wandered in and out of the room, not knowing what to do, then went to the icon corner and repeated prayers Ulyana had drilled into him as a boy.

Collectivization arrived with meetings, rules, and fear. Aleksey could not follow speeches. He watched faces and copied the words that seemed safe. By 1932 his father Fyodor died. The next year, with hunger tightening and quotas pressing, Aleksey began taking small amounts of grain after work, tucked into his shirt or a sack. He did it more than once in 1933 and 1934, never speaking of it plainly, only saying, “For the cow,” and looking away. Ekaterina scolded him for the risk, then cooked the grain into thin porridge anyway.

In 1937 and 1938 the village felt the terror. A man from the next hamlet was taken away one night; no one spoke his name after that. Aleksey avoided the loudest talk. He repeated official phrases without understanding them and kept his head down.

The next winter he hauled wood on a sledge in icy ruts. He slipped, the load shifted, and his lower leg and ankle took the weight. The village set the bone as best they could. It healed crooked. From then on he walked with a limp, putting weight on the other side, grimacing when he thought no one watched. He could not keep up with the hardest field work and was pushed toward lighter tasks, which lowered his standing more.

Praskovya died in 1939. Aleksey stayed near the grave longer than others after the burial, then went home and sat under the icons until Ekaterina told him to eat.

War came again in 1941. The German advance and the fighting around Bryansk turned the countryside into a place of searches and requisitions. Their household slept in the forest on nights when raids were expected, wrapped in coats, listening for engines and shouting. Soldiers came through the village and took what they wanted. Shots sounded from nearby hamlets. The men in the village watched for partisan couriers; a young man would appear at dusk and vanish again. That autumn Ekaterina fell ill with a fever that would not break. She died in early November, worn down by months of short rations and fear. Aleksey sat by her body for a long time, then went outside and stood in the cold until Nikolay came to bring him back in. Galina moved in permanently to help raise the boy and manage the household.

The Red Army pushed the Germans back in September 1943. The kolkhoz resumed its routines, though half the horses were gone and the barns had been stripped. That winter, while the household was out in the fields, someone stole stored potatoes and a few tools from their shed. The loss forced them to borrow from Ivan and Anna, and Aleksey’s shame came out as angry talk, blaming strangers, then blaming Pavel, then blaming no one. He returned to taking small amounts from kolkhoz stores through 1944, more often now, to keep food in the house.

In February 1945, after weeks of coughing and cold, Aleksey died of a respiratory infection. Nikolay, now eighteen, helped Galina wash his father's body and lay it out beneath the icons. They carried him to the village cemetery where Orthodox prayers were read and a simple wooden cross was set at the grave.
