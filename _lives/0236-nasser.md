# father_occupation: Smallholder agro-pastoralist (some household animals + small plots/rainfed
#   cultivation; limited independence)
# historical_context:
# - event: 'Ottoman administration of the Hijaz via the Sharifate of Mecca: periodic
#     levies, route-policing demands, and local power bargaining that could affect rural
#     security and obligations'
#   timing: throughout life, especially ages 15–40
# - event: Heightened insecurity on overland routes in some years (tribal conflict and
#     state efforts to secure pilgrimage and trade corridors), influencing local markets
#     and travel safety even for hinterland communities
#   timing: most likely ages 20–35
# - event: Locust incursions affecting western/central Arabia, periodically stripping
#     crops and grazing and triggering price spikes and hunger even in areas reliant
#     on herding
#   timing: intermittent; likely at least once ages 30–60
# - event: Livestock disease outbreaks (goat/sheep mortality, camel ailments) that periodically
#     reduced herds and household wealth across pastoral regions
#   timing: recurring; likely at least once ages 20–50
# - event: Epidemic disease waves reaching the Hijaz (including plague recurrences and
#     other acute fevers) via caravan and pilgrimage networks, raising mortality and
#     disrupting movement in affected years
#   timing: intermittent; more likely ages 10–30 and 40–60

#       reshaping kin relations and reinforcing avoidant, vigilant behavior.
#     incident: homicide
#   - age: 34
#     connection: Amplified by livestock disease/poor rains and possibly locust impacts;

#     incident: sick_relative
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-7 (1600-1607)
#     key_events:
#     - 'Raised in a nuclear household with strong routines: prayer cues, strict work
#       habits, close supervision by mother.'
#     - Learns herding basics and water/fuel chores; early fearfulness shaped by stories
#       of raids and infant deaths.
#     - 'First vivid exposure to violence: seeing aftermath of a skirmish/raid near
#       grazing routes (seed for later trauma symptoms).'
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 8-19 (1608-1619)

#       more directly.
#     phase: Young adulthood
#   - age_range: 33-55 (1633-1655)
#     key_events:

#       debt/patronage obligations and tightens household control.
#     - Younger brother Khalid dies (1636), increasing kin responsibilities and guilt.
#     - Gradual rebuilding through meticulous husbandry; by 1645-1655 becomes trusted
#       to manage a patron's herd/plot (major achievement).
#     - Mother dies (1647); grief and recurring nightmares/avoidance intensify.

#     death_age: 55
#     death_year: 1651
#     name: Uthman

#   - birth_year: 1600
#     death_age: 64
#     death_year: 1664

#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1602
#     death_age: 34
#     death_year: 1636
#     name: Khalid
#     narrative_role: Younger brother who takes more risks; draws Nasser into periodic
#       conflicts and seasonal moves. His early death leaves Nasser feeling responsible
#       for supporting Khalid's dependents/kin obligations.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds trust with patrons and kin (enabling his later 'major achievement'),
#       but creates rigidity and friction with more impulsive relatives.
#     scene: Counts animals at dusk, re-ties knots, checks waterskins, and insists on
#       fixed prayer/work rhythms even when others cut corners; keeps a mental tally
#       of debts/obligations despite illiteracy.
#     timing: visible from adolescence; strongest in midlife rebuilding (ages 33-55)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (98th percentile)
#   - consequence: Limits alliances and marriage bargaining power; reduces overt conflict
#       initiation but increases reliance on a few key mediators.
#     scene: Avoids market chatter and gatherings, speaks briefly, lets brothers negotiate;
#       prefers solitary herding watches and sits at the edge of communal meals.
#     timing: childhood onward; worsens after homicide (late 20s)
#     trait: Extraversion (2nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Pushes risk-avoidance and preparedness, but contributes to strained
#       sleep and tense household atmosphere.
#     scene: Catastrophizes about rain failure and raids, checks door-ropes and animals
#       repeatedly at night; irritability after small setbacks.
#     timing: teens onward; spikes during economic crisis and bereavements (30s, late
#       50s-60)
#     trait: Neuroticism (69th percentile)
#   - consequence: Facilitates reconciliation and community standing, but sometimes
#       leads him to accept unfair terms from stronger parties.
#     scene: Shares water/food when possible, avoids prolonged grudges, agrees to mediation
#       and compensation after disputes; softens with children and the sick.
#     timing: adulthood, especially post-homicide settlement (late 20s-40s)
#     trait: Agreeableness (87th percentile)
#   - consequence: Helps survival and bargaining, but creates suspicion and occasional
#       accusations, increasing stress.
#     scene: In lean years he minimizes what he owes or what stock he has when dealing
#       with outsiders, and is willing to use ambiguity or patronage leverage to protect
#       his household.
#     timing: most visible during economic crisis and negotiations (ages 33-40)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (25th percentile)
#   - consequence: Increases vulnerability in disputes and debts, reinforcing his preference
#       for routine, trusted relationships, and avoidance of unfamiliar dealings.
#     scene: Struggles with complex verbal agreements and lineage/patronage politics;
#       relies on simple rules of thumb and on brothers/sons for nuanced negotiation.
#     timing: young adulthood through old age
#     trait: Low intelligence (19th percentile)
#   - consequence: Shapes migration choices and social withdrawal; contributes to strict
#       control of household movement and difficulty grieving openly.
#     scene: After military service and the later homicide, he has recurrent nightmares,
#       startles at sudden shouts or hoofbeats, avoids certain grazing routes, and becomes
#       emotionally shut down during conflict talk.
#     timing: onset ages 24-29; chronic with flares after deaths (1647, 1656-1660)
#     trait: Trauma-related disorder (PTSD-like)
# number_of_children: '8'
# number_of_siblings: '5'
# occupation: Agro-pastoralist smallholder (keeps goats/sheep/camels and works small
#   rainfed plots; primary identity as herder/farmer)
# religion: 'More observant Sunni routine: aims for five daily prayers (often with mosque/congregation
#   when possible), Ramadan fasting, zakat/charity as customary, regular Qur’an recitation/supplication;
#   local imam/teacher influence'

# structured_incidents:
# - event: After a poor run of rains, his goats and a few camels weakened and several
#     died; to keep seed and family provisions he had to borrow grain and money through
#     a patron/client tie, pledging future labor and a share of the next season’s yield.
#   reasoning: Agro‑pastoral households in marginal rainfall zones were highly exposed
#     to drought, disease in herds, and debt; despite later modest respectability, at
#     least one severe shock over 64 years is fairly likely.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 33–36
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: Over years of careful herding and saving, he rebuilt his stock after earlier
#     losses and was trusted to manage a small herd and rainfed plot on behalf of a
#     better-off household, effectively becoming a stable smallholder in his own right
#     and a recognized, dependable man in the local community.
#   reasoning: For an illiterate rural smallholder of client origin, most lives left
#     little public record, but achieving respected lower‑middle standing and successfully
#     establishing a household could be locally notable even if not elite.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 45–55
#   type: major_achievement
# - event: During an armed clash tied to a livestock dispute/raid along a grazing route,
#     he struck and killed a man in the fighting; the aftermath was handled through
#     kin negotiation and compensation to prevent a wider feud.
#   reasoning: Feuding/raiding could escalate to killings, but a smallholder (not a
#     dedicated warrior) and low extraversion makes lethal violence less common than
#     nonlethal fighting; still plausible over a long life with warfare impact.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 27–29
#   type: homicide
# - event: In multiple disputes over watering access and animals (including one during
#     a seasonal move), he took part in serious fights, beating opponents with a stick
#     and fists—violence that stopped short of killing but left injuries and simmering
#     resentments.
#   reasoning: The most common form of perpetrated violence would be participation in
#     serious fights (brawls, revenge assaults, disciplining disputes) connected to
#     honor, herding conflicts, or raids; this fits the highest base rate.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: recurring, ages 20–40
#   type: physical_assault_perp
# - event: He spent months caring for his wife during a long wasting illness—organizing
#     food and water, arranging help from kin, and sitting with her through periods
#     of fever and weakness until she eventually died, leaving him a widower.
#   reasoning: In a large family with high infectious burden and limited medical care,
#     prolonged nursing of a spouse/child/parent (especially in later life) was common
#     and likely in a stem household.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 56–58
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: For several months he served in a locally raised armed contingent under a
#     regional leader aligned with Hijazi/Ottoman authority, providing escort and guard
#     duty on routes and around settlements during a tense period of conflict.
#   reasoning: Formal state military service/conscription was less typical for rural
#     tribal smallholders than for urban or garrison populations; local armed participation
#     existed but often outside 'formal' service.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 24–25
#   type: military_service

Nasser was born on January 29, 1600, in a small settlement zone of the inland Makkah region, where low hills and open savanna met dry wadis. The land sat under the Ottoman order that reached the Hijaz through the Sharif of Mecca; for families like his, that power was felt in escort demands on roads, occasional levies, and the shifting safety of routes more than in courts or paper. At home people spoke a local Arabic vernacular, prayed as Sunnis, and measured a man by the animals he could keep alive and the kin he could stand beside.

His father Saad held a little of everything: a few camels, goats and sheep, and small rainfed plots that could produce barley in a generous season. Saad’s standing came through a patron tie that offered protection and credit at a price. His mother Aisha ran the household. She kept tight order: water carried early, dough mixed before the heat, and children put to tasks without delay. Nasser grew up as the fifth of six boys. Salih, the eldest, was already big enough to take animals out when Nasser was small; Uthman and Abdallah filled the space between, rougher and louder than he was. Hamad, the second child, died as an infant before Nasser’s birth, and Aisha spoke of him plainly when she checked a baby’s breathing or tightened a swaddling wrap. Khalid came two years after Nasser, eager for risk and quick to laugh at scolding.

Nasser learned early to stay quiet and exact. He tied and re-tied the rope on a waterskin until the knot sat flat. He counted goats at dusk and again at dawn, and if a brother teased him for it he did not answer, only counted again. His small pleasures were simple: the first cup of hot, sweet tea when someone had sugar, dates pressed into bread, and sitting where the evening breeze moved through the acacia scrub. He avoided crowded market talk. When men gathered to argue prices, he stood at the edge and watched hands and faces.

By the time he was ten, he followed Abdallah on longer circuits to grazing. They slept in thin shade and woke before sunrise to move animals toward scattered plants after rare showers. Once, near a route where travelers passed toward Ta’if and the Hijaz towns, he saw the aftermath of a fight—dead animals, a man’s blood on stones, women wailing from a distance. That night he did not sleep. In later years, sudden hoofbeats in the dark pulled him upright with his heart racing, and he never again chose that route when another path existed.

As a teenager he fell into a hard routine: prayer by the sun's positions when he could, steady work, and few words. He grew tall—taller than his brothers by the time he was fully grown—and was attractive in the blunt way people noticed, broad in the shoulders, with a face that drew looks from women at wells. He did not know what to do with the attention. Uthman took over bargaining and jokes. Nasser carried loads, tended the sick animals, and watched the sky.

He married Fatimah in 1620. The marriage joined two modest households tied into the same network of patrons and kin. Fatimah was competent and direct. She corrected him when he wasted time checking a rope twice, then set a clean cloth over dough and sent him to fetch more water. Their first son, Yahya, was born in 1621; Salih followed in 1623. Nasser held each newborn briefly, then returned to work, but he listened for their breathing at night the way his mother had.

When he was twenty-four, Captain Yusuf arrived with word that men were needed for escort and guard duty, aligned with Hijazi authority and the Ottoman order. Nasser went for several months in 1624, leaving Fatimah with small children. He stood nights at a post near a route where pilgrims and caravans moved in safer seasons, and he learned the tightness of waiting for trouble. Men shouted, animals bolted, and once an argument turned into a beating with sticks that left a man broken on the ground. Nasser returned home thinner and quieter. From then on he slept light, waking at any sudden sound.

The next years brought fights closer to home. Grazing and water were never settled for long, and as his children increased, Nasser pressed harder for space. Between 1622 and 1640 he took part in repeated brawls—at a well mouth when someone pushed ahead, at a wadi when goats mixed and accusations flew. He carried a stick and used it. He struck men with his fists and the heavy end of wood, then walked away without speaking, leaving others to shout the words.

In 1628 a dispute along a grazing route turned into an armed clash. A group from a neighboring line, led by Husayn al-Harbi, drove animals hard toward a water place. Nasser’s side met them with drawn blades and clubs. In the crush, Nasser struck a man with a blade and the man fell and did not rise. The killing forced immediate negotiation. Older men set a time for talks; kin gathered; compensation was weighed. Nasser sat through it with his eyes down, sweating, answering questions with short phrases. The diya settlement kept the conflict from widening, but he began to avoid gatherings. He refused to sit where Husayn’s relatives might appear. If men began to argue loudly, his hands tightened on whatever he held and his breathing changed.

Saad died in 1632. With the father gone, Uthman expected Nasser to take on more of the household’s obligations, but Nasser struggled with complicated terms and relied on Abdallah to interpret promises and penalties. He compensated with relentless care. Animals were watered on schedule; fodder was conserved; debts were remembered without writing. He counted out measures of grain carefully and did not forgive a missed obligation.

Then came the hard run of years. In 1634 the rains failed in sequence and pasture shrank. Goats grew thin; a camel’s ribs showed; several animals died. Grain prices rose in the market villages, and Nasser’s household faced hunger. He went to Ibrahim ibn Jابر, a wealthier holder with whom the family had long client ties, and borrowed grain and money. The terms were clear and harsh: future labor, a share of yield, and obligations that grew heavier each season. Nasser took on extra work with little speech and less rest. When Khalid, his younger brother, died in 1636 at thirty-four, Nasser spent a day silent under a tree, then went back to hauling water. He felt responsible for what remained of Khalid’s line and obligations and pressed Yahya to work harder.

Children arrived and died. Maryam was born in 1626, Zaynab in 1629, Umar in 1632, Khadijah in 1635. Safiyyah died in 1638 the day she was born. Abd al-Rahman died in 1640 before he could be carried far from the sleeping place. His brother Salih, the eldest, died that same year at forty-eight; the household lost a mediator and a voice that had always spoken for caution. Maryam, the first daughter, died in 1646 of a fever that lasted a week. Nasser did the funeral washing when needed, then returned to the animals. When his mother Aisha died in 1647, he stood through the prayers with his jaw set, then walked away from the men and sat alone until sunset. That year he began to wake shouting from dreams he would not describe.

Despite that, the household rebuilt. Nasser's careful habits made him useful to Ibrahim ibn Jابر. By 1648 he was trusted to manage a small herd and a rainfed plot on Ibrahim's behalf. Uthman died in 1651 at fifty-five; he had always been the one to bargain with patrons, and his absence forced Nasser to speak more in negotiations, though he did it badly. He compensated with strict order: animals counted twice, fodder rationed, and everyone in the household assigned a task. He kept close track of what was owed and what was received, and he did not waste movement or talk. Neighbors began to treat him as a solid man, not only a client.

Loss returned in his later years. Umar died in 1656 at twenty-four, and Nasser banned his remaining sons from taking certain routes. A few months later Fatimah fell into a wasting illness. From 1656 into 1658 Nasser handled months of caregiving: water carried to her mouth, bedding cleaned, shade adjusted, food coaxed in small bites. He spoke to Shaykh Musa for Qur’anic recitation and guidance, and he kept the prayer schedule rigid even when sleep was broken. When Fatimah died in 1658, he did not remarry. He moved into a stem household with Yahya, now married, and accepted help he had once refused.

In 1660 two more deaths struck: his son Salih at thirty-seven and his daughter Zaynab at thirty-one. The following year Abdallah, the brother closest to him in age and his companion since childhood, died at sixty-three. Nasser stopped attending most gatherings after that. He sat in the same place each evening, facing the open ground, listening for sounds he could not control. He still insisted on early rising and correct tasks. He still counted animals even when Yahya laughed and told him the herd was safe.

On July 28, 1664, Nasser collapsed after the dawn prayer. He had complained of heaviness in his chest for days and then could not stand. Men washed his body, wrapped it in plain cloth, and performed the funeral prayer; he was buried in the local grave ground, laid on his right side facing the qibla.
