Tëkïra was born near the end of the dry season. The grass by the river was cut down to pale stubble and the acacias gave little shade. Her family lived in a small cluster of huts and cattle pens on the White Nile south of the confluence, where fields could be planted when the water fell.

Her father moved the household between grazing and the river plots. That morning he tightened a rope halter, checked the calves, and walked to the next compound to speak with his brother about where to water the herd without trouble. Men kept watch in the evenings when cattle were brought in close.

Her mother stayed at the hearth. She had already buried two children, a girl and a boy, both dead before their first steps. She still rose before light to grind sorghum, fetch water, and rub ash on the cooking pots so they would not crack.

When her labor started, women from nearby huts came and sat with her. They warmed water, cleaned rags, and steadied her shoulders when the pains came close together. An elder set a small dish of milk at the doorway and spoke the names of the dead in the family line.

Tëkïra came out very small. Her skin lay loose on her arms and thighs, and her cry was thin. She drew a few breaths and then stopped fighting for air. The women turned her to clear her mouth and rubbed her back with warm hands, but she did not strengthen.

Before midday she went still. Her mother wrapped her in a soft hide kept for carrying things and laid her in the shade at the edge of the compound until the heat eased and they could take her from the huts.
