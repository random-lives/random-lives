Kaeo was born in May 1562 in a low, wet part of Lower Burma where the Toungoo king’s officials counted households and took dues. Her village lay among rainfed fields and tree cover, with creeks that spread out in the rains and left standing water afterward. Her people spoke a Tai tongue at home. In the market and at the monastery compound she heard Burmese, but she answered in her own speech and let others translate when it mattered.

She was the fifth child her mother carried to term. Two older brothers lived. Two babies had been buried with no names spoken for long. The surviving brothers, Kham and Ai, ran barefoot when they were small and were already working by the time Kaeo could walk. Kham followed their father into the fields. Ai watched the water and traps.

The household held more than a couple and their children. An older man slept near the hearth and sat by the posts in the afternoon. An older woman kept a basket of herbs and thread and decided which rice was saved for seed. When the rains began, adults lifted baskets onto higher shelves and pushed mats up the walls. Some years the water stayed long enough to spoil stored grain. Mice came. Mosquitoes thickened around puddles. Everyone knew the months when fevers took people.

Kaeo did not ask many questions and did not roam. She stayed near the house yard, the loom, and the paths to the well and the fuelwood. When she was sent for leaves or water, she went straight and came straight back. When other girls talked about distant towns and travelers, she listened and then turned back to what was in her hands.

Her mother spun cotton on a small spindle and taught Kaeo to do the same. The thread had to be even, the twist tight enough that it would not break when pulled through the warp. Kaeo learned the work early, sitting near the older woman and watching her fingers. If the thread snapped she tied it and kept going. She did not plan her days carefully. She let tasks pile up until someone spoke sharply, then she moved fast and finished what she was told.

When Kaeo was eight or nine, a bad rainy season brought water into the house yard. The men dug a shallow ditch. The older woman boiled water longer and insisted on clean cups, but children still fell sick. A neighbor’s son died after days of watery stools. The monks chanted over him, and his kin brought a small packet of rice and a candle to the monastery for merit.

Festivals came every year. Villagers swept the monastery compound, patched the roof, and brought rice, oil, and cloth. Kaeo helped her mother carry bundles and watched the novices line up for alms. On those days the village felt crowded. Traders and relatives came from nearby places. Sickness also came with them. After one festival, Kaeo’s father lay shaking with fever and sweat. He survived, but for weeks he moved slowly and lost weight. The older man took his place at the edge of the fields, sitting where he could watch hired hands and kin work.

Kaeo’s brothers grew tall. Kham learned the boundaries of fields and how to speak to the men who came to measure and record dues. Ai learned the water routes and the habits of fish and crabs in flooded patches. Kaeo learned to weave wider cloth. She handled the loom with patience in the morning and irritability in the afternoon, snapping at younger cousins when they touched the threads.

When Kaeo was about sixteen, her family arranged a marriage with a Tai-speaking household in a nearby village. The move was short, within the same district, a walk with a loaded basket and a small group of kin. Her husband’s name was Saen. He worked his family’s fields and handled exchanges at the market. He did not read, and neither did she. The household she entered included Saen’s parents. His mother, Nang Hom, spoke steadily and watched Kaeo’s hands. His father, U Than, was already old. He sat with his back against a post and coughed into a cloth.

Kaeo’s first year there was full of orders. Nang Hom told her when to pound rice, when to boil water, when to dye thread, when to weed the edge plots. Kaeo did the work, but she forgot tasks that were not in front of her. She left soaked cotton too long and had to throw part of it away. She let a pot boil dry once and got slapped on the forearm with a folded cloth. She stopped arguing. She watched Nang Hom, copied what she saw, and stayed quiet.

U Than’s weakness worsened over those years. He needed help standing. His legs cramped. He could not walk to the latrine without someone holding his elbow. Kaeo became the person who did it most often. She rose early to fetch water, warmed it, and washed his body behind a screen of hanging cloth. She cooked him soft rice and thin broth and fed him with a spoon when his hands shook. She cut firewood into smaller pieces because he complained about smoke and coughing. When he soiled himself, she cleaned him and washed the mats. She did not talk much while she worked. She moved him carefully, impatient with delays, but she did not refuse.

At seventeen she became pregnant. Nang Hom watched her belly, her feet, her appetite. Kaeo still worked the loom, but shorter sessions. When the time came, women gathered in the house. The birth left her exhausted. The baby was a boy. He cried for a short time, then his cries thinned and stopped within days. Kaeo wrapped him and handed him over without drama. The monks chanted. A small offering of rice and cloth went to the monastery soon after.

After that, Kaeo returned to weaving. Cotton arrived from nearby traders and from fields kept by kin. She spun fine thread and set a tight warp. The cloth came out smooth and even. At eighteen and nineteen she produced a long length, well patterned and without broken lines. The household needed merit that year. Nang Hom decided the cloth would go to the monastery festival as part of the family’s offering. Kaeo carried it, folded and wrapped, and placed it before the monks. Men and women in the compound touched the fabric and nodded. Nang Hom spoke for the household, and Saen stood behind her with his hands together.

The rains kept coming, heavy and persistent. Water logged the edge plots and made it hard to dry thread. Mosquitoes gathered near the pots and drains. People in the village took turns with fever and cough. One season, troops and porters passed on the road toward Bago. They bought rice and salt and demanded quick service. The village headman counted baskets and men. Women were told to cook for those drafted.

In 1582, during the wet months, Kaeo began coughing. At first she kept weaving. The cough deepened and brought pain in her chest. She still rose to fetch water for U Than, still boiled his broth, but she stopped carrying heavy loads. Her breath shortened. Her voice grew thin. Saen’s mother moved U Than’s care to another female relative and kept Kaeo on a mat near the hearth where the smoke was less.

Kaeo died in August 1582 in the house of her husband’s parents while the rains still came in the afternoons. The household washed her body, wrapped it, and carried it to the cremation ground. The monks chanted, and Saen placed small offerings for her merit before the ashes cooled.
