#   timing: ages ~48–50 (1290–1292)
# - event: 'Shifts in market access and demand linked to Mediterranean trade through
#     Sidon (including war-related embargoes, tolls, and disruptions): volatility in

#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 29
#     connection: After consecutive poor harvest pressures and dues demands, Hanna begins
#       illicit grazing and woodcutting on claimed lands and underreports olive-oil
#       yield; behavior reinforced by peer examples and his own impulsive confidence.
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   - age: 32
#     connection: Pattern continues as market prices and tolls fluctuate; arguments
#       with collectors and neighbors deepen his reputation as both sociable and combative.
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   - age: 42
#     connection: A severe winter chest sickness leaves lasting cough and breathlessness;
#       shifts his role toward coordinating labor, bargaining, and lighter tasks while
#       relying more on wife/children for heavy fieldwork.
#     incident: chronic_illness
#   - age: 49
#     connection: Eldest son’s wasting illness requires months of care; the household
#       seeks prayers/remedies through parish/monastic channels while war disruptions
#       make travel and supplies harder.
#     incident: sick_relative
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-7 (1242-1249)
#     key_events:
#     - Born near Sidon into a Melkite peasant household; earliest memories include
#       parish feasts, icons at home, and adults’ talk of insecurity on roads.
#     - Losses of small siblings (Matta, Iskandar) shape household routines around illness
#       and prayer.
#     - Father begins involving him in errands and craft-adjacent tasks (carrying, fetching,
#       listening to bargaining), feeding Hanna’s sociability.
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 8-18 (1250-1260)
#     key_events:
#     - Frontier instability intensifies intermittently; Hanna learns to read a little
#       (church/practical) and picks up conversational Greek from coastal interactions
#       and church-related contexts.
#     - Helps more regularly with farming work; strong social presence in village gatherings,
#       but starts getting into arguments and scuffles with other boys.
#     - Begins courting/marriage negotiations; family seeks a steady match to anchor
#       him.
#     phase: Later childhood & adolescence
#   - age_range: 19-35 (1261-1277)
#     key_events:
#     - Marries Ruqayya (1263) and becomes a household head; first children born, with
#       repeated infant losses.
#     - Father Butrus dies (1273), forcing Hanna to shoulder more responsibility and
#       rely on his mother and sister Maryam for household stability.
#     - Market volatility and bad harvest pressures lead to riskier behavior and disputes
#       with dues-collectors/landholders.
#     phase: Young to mid adulthood (household formation)
#   - age_range: 36-45 (1278-1287)
#     key_events:
#     - Maintains ordinary standing as a cultivator, trading labor and favors with neighbors;
#       ongoing frontier pressures and occasional provisioning demands.
#     - Develops reputation as a loud, persuasive talker at the market and in village
#       meetings, but also as someone who can escalate arguments.
#     - Daughter Maryam dies at 18 (1287), adding grief and heightening his anxious
#       temperament just as the wider region becomes more dangerous.
#     phase: Mature adulthood
#   - age_range: 46-55 (1288-1298)
#     key_events:
#     - Military campaigns and the capture of Sidon (1289) and the fall of Acre (1291)
#       disrupt travel and safety; household experiences displacement/unstable lodging
#       by the end of life.
#     - Onset of chronic chest illness (early 1280s into 1290s) reduces capacity for
#       heavy labor; relies more on family labor and lighter tasks.
#     - Prolonged caregiving for son Butrus during wasting illness, ending with the
#       son’s death (1295); Hanna dies violently in 1298 amid the insecure aftermath.

#     name: Salma
#     narrative_role: Youngest; dies in infancy. Her short life becomes part of the
#       family’s grief ledger and reinforces Hanna’s later protectiveness over his own
#       children.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds wide networks that help the household in normal years, but
#       also puts him at the center of disputes and makes him more exposed during political/military
#       tension.
#     scene: At Sidon’s market and at village feast-days he is the one greeting everyone,
#       negotiating loudly, joking, and drawing a small crowd—often volunteering to
#       speak to outsiders or collectors.
#     timing: most visible from adolescence through mature adulthood (ages ~14-45)
#     trait: Extraversion (99th percentile)
#   - consequence: Frequent friction; occasional social costs (less help in harvest)
#       offset by his ability to reconcile when calm.
#     scene: He snaps at a neighbor over boundary stones and escalates a minor dispute
#       into a shouting match; later he regrets it and tries to repair ties through
#       gifts and church-mediated peace.
#     timing: young adulthood into mature adulthood (ages ~20-40)
#     trait: Agreeableness low (20th percentile)
#   - consequence: Greater exposure to fines/conflict and periodic household stress;
#       wife compensates with planning and routine.
#     scene: He procrastinates on dues/grain storage and then scrambles, cutting corners
#       and taking risks (including underreporting produce) when deadlines or collectors
#       arrive.
#     timing: especially during household-formation years (ages ~25-35)
#     trait: Conscientiousness low (25th percentile)
#   - consequence: Short temper and worry strain family relations; also makes him vigilant
#       about immediate threats.
#     scene: After raids rumors or a harsh winter illness season, he becomes sleepless
#       and irritable, repeatedly checking on animals and stores and seeking reassurance
#       through prayers and priestly blessing.
#     timing: intermittent, intensified after major bereavements and during wartime
#       disruption (ages ~30-55)
#     trait: Neuroticism high (75th percentile)
#   - consequence: Maintains a baseline of trust and social reintegration after conflicts,
#       preventing a slide into predatory behavior.
#     scene: Even when he cheats on dues in desperate years, he refuses to exploit a
#       weaker neighbor’s loss, insisting on fair measures in small exchanges and sharing
#       food at church-linked charity moments.
#     timing: through adulthood (ages ~25-55)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility high (80th percentile)
#   - consequence: Slight advantage in negotiations and understanding obligations; also
#       feeds confidence in disputes.
#     scene: He can slowly sound out familiar prayers or a short note from a priest/collector
#       and uses this to argue about quantities and obligations, relying on others for
#       writing.
#     timing: adolescence onward (ages ~15-55)
#     trait: Intelligence above average (61st percentile) + limited reading
# number_of_children: '5'
# number_of_siblings: '6'
# occupation: Peasant farmer/cultivator (primary identity farming; may do occasional
#   craft labor)
# religion: 'Typical rural Melkite parish life: Sunday/feast liturgy when possible;
#   home prayers (crossing, short prayers); icons/cross in home; fasting seasons; saint
#   veneration'

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During a bad harvest year he repeatedly grazed his small animals and cut
#     firewood in land claimed by a nearby lordly/monastic holding without paying the
#     customary dues, and he also underreported part of his olive-oil yield when the
#     local collector came through the villages near Sidon.
#   reasoning: Opportunistic petty theft, illicit cutting/grazing, smuggling, and tax/fee
#     evasion were common survival strategies; low conscientiousness increases rule-breaking,
#     but stable status and high honesty-humility reduce it.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: recurring pattern, roughly ages 29–34
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime
# - event: After a severe winter chest sickness, he was left with a long-lasting cough
#     and breathlessness that flared each cold season, limiting heavy fieldwork and
#     making him rely more on lighter tasks and help from family.
#   reasoning: Surviving to 55 in a high-infection environment makes at least one lingering
#     condition plausible (recurrent fevers, chronic respiratory disease, intestinal
#     illness, untreated injuries), and many such conditions limited work for years.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: sustained period, onset around ages 41–43 and persisting until death at
#     55
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: For months at a time he and his wife cared for a son who developed recurrent
#     fever and wasting (unable to work, needing feeding and washing), including traveling
#     to a local priest/monastic site for prayers and remedies before the young man
#     eventually died.
#   reasoning: With multiple child deaths (including infants) and a household exposed
#     to serious illness, prolonged care for a sick child/spouse/close kin is very likely
#     at least once, even if the person ultimately died.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: sustained period, roughly ages 48–51 (centered on the son’s final illness
#     before death at 31)
#   type: sick_relative

Hanna was born on November 26, 1242, in the hills above Sidon, in a Melkite village that prayed in the Byzantine rite and spoke Arabic in the lanes and fields. The coast belonged to a Crusader lordship, and the countryside lived with tolls, requisitions, and rumors of armies moving between the strongholds and the interior.

His father, Butrus, worked stone and wood when there was building to do—repairs to terraces, a new lintel for a doorway, a patched wall for a neighbor—then turned back to the family’s small plot. His mother, Mariam, ran the house: grinding, baking, spinning, tending a few animals, and keeping a corner with an icon and a little lamp that she lit on feast days. Hanna grew up hearing Greek words mixed into prayer and church talk; by adolescence he could hold a conversation with Greek-speaking clerics and travelers on the coastal road, even though he read only slowly and could not write more than a clumsy mark.

His oldest sister Maryam, born in 1239, mothered the younger ones almost as much as their mother did. Bulus, born in 1240, died in 1242 before Hanna could remember him. Yusuf, born in 1244, became the brother Hanna would argue with and depend on through their lives. When Matta came in 1246 and died the next year, Mariam hung a small cross above the sleeping place and took Hanna with her to the priest for a blessing, as if a blessing could be carried home like bread. Iskandar lived long enough to chase chickens and pester Hanna for nuts from a pouch; he died in 1251. Salma came late, in 1251, and was gone by 1252. The house filled and emptied quickly. Hanna learned to keep his voice down when his mother's face turned rigid, and he learned what adults did after a death: wash the body, wrap it, call the priest, and move through prayers without much talking.

By eight he ran errands for his father to Sidon’s edge. Butrus liked having a boy who would walk up to any man and start talking. Hanna bargained too loudly, laughed too easily, and kept asking questions of strangers. He enjoyed sitting near the olives at the market while his father checked a stone order, listening to sailors and muleteers argue over tolls and roads. He liked roasted chickpeas and the sharp taste of salted fish when someone could afford it, and he teased other boys by inventing nicknames for their goats.

He fought, too. A shove over a turn at the mill turned into a fist to the mouth when Hanna was fifteen, and his mother made him kiss the priest’s hand and apologize after liturgy. He apologized fast and made jokes on the way home, then started another argument with Yusuf, the brother born in 1244, over who had left the gate open. Yusuf had a careful way of counting jars and measuring seed. Hanna mocked it and then depended on it.

In 1263 Hanna married Ruqayya from a nearby Melkite village. The marriage began with the usual exchange of visits and negotiations between families, then a church blessing and a meal that ended with Hanna singing too loudly and drawing laughter from young men at the edge of the gathering. Ruqayya learned early that he woke ready to talk and wanted to hear every scrap of news. She also learned that when he was irritated he threw words like stones.

Their first child, a son, was born in 1264. They named him Butrus, after Hanna’s father. Hanna carried the baby outside to show neighbors and boasted that the boy’s grip would crush an olive pit. In 1267 another son was born and died the same day. Hanna snapped at Ruqayya when she asked him to fetch water, then returned later with a jug and a plate of bread, saying nothing. A daughter, Maryam, arrived in 1269 and lived; she grew into a steady girl who learned her mother’s routines. In 1272 a son was named Hanna and did not survive. Salma was born in 1275 and died before the end of the month.

Hanna’s mother kept the lamp burning before the icon of the Virgin on feast days and took the living children to kiss the icon at church. Hanna crossed himself in the mornings and at night and learned short prayers in Greek from Father Georgios, but he prayed in Arabic at home, quick and practical: for rain, for the animals, for a child’s fever to break. He disliked long sermons. He liked the singing.

Butrus, his father, died in 1273. Hanna argued with Yusuf over how to divide tools and who would take which obligations. Their sister Maryam came between them, calm and firm, and forced them to settle it in front of witnesses. Hanna took the field work as his main identity and kept a hand in building tasks when someone paid well, but he did not keep careful accounts. Ruqayya kept track of jars, cloth, and seed. She stored grain more neatly than he did and made him look less reckless than he was.

A bad run of harvests struck when Hanna was in his late twenties, and the dues felt heavier. In 1271 he began turning animals onto land claimed by a nearby monastery estate when the overseer was elsewhere. He cut firewood from the same slopes, bringing it home in a bundle and telling Ruqayya it was better than buying. When the collector’s agent, Khalil, came through and asked about olive oil, Hanna spoke smoothly and set out a smaller number of jars than the press had yielded. He repeated these tricks each season through 1276, shifting animals at night and sending a boy to watch the road. He told himself it was only taking what a hard year allowed. When Sarkis, the monastery steward, confronted him, Hanna argued until spittle showed at the corner of his mouth, then offered a jar of oil as if it ended the matter. It did not end it, but it kept the dispute from becoming formal.

He had friends he chose, not just kin. Nabil, a neighbor cultivator, drank wine with him after market days and played a simple throwing game with stones near the terraces. They laughed at travelers’ accents and at a mule that kicked its own load over. Hanna enjoyed being the man who could get a group talking. He hated waiting in lines for milling and complained loudly about anyone who tried to push ahead, even when he had done it himself.

Maryam, his daughter, became his helper as she grew. She spun and carried water and could quiet the younger children in other houses. In 1287 she died at eighteen after a sudden illness that turned a strong girl into a body that needed washing. Hanna shouted at Father Georgios for not coming sooner, then stood silent through the prayers, jaw clenched, eyes red.

Winter sickness hit Hanna hard a few years later. In 1284 a chest illness left him with a cough that did not end when the weather warmed. Each cold season after that he wheezed in the mornings and avoided the steepest terraces. He took on lighter tasks: sorting olives, supervising younger men, arguing over prices. He still went to market, still talked to everyone, still pushed himself to be present.

When the Mamluk campaigns pressed toward the coast and Sidon fell in 1289, roads became dangerous and villages took in frightened relatives. By 1291, after Acre fell, the coastal world broke apart. Hanna’s household left their home for safer lodging inland, carrying what they could, leaving some jars buried and some animals driven ahead. They stayed crowded in another family’s space, sleeping close, possessions stacked against a wall.

His eldest son Butrus fell into a wasting fever in 1291 and never truly recovered. Hanna and Ruqayya spent months feeding him broth and softened bread, washing him, and lifting him when he could not stand. They took him to a monastic site where Father Georgios met them, and they offered oil for the lamp before the icons and asked for prayers. Hanna spoke to the sick boy with a gentleness that surprised even Ruqayya, telling him stories from markets and repeating village jokes to make him smile. Butrus died in 1295 at thirty-one.

Hanna did not return to steady life after that. He stayed restless, quick to anger, and quick to reconcile. In the spring of 1298, while moving between lodgings and checking on stored goods, he was caught on a road by armed men amid the postwar disorder—bandits or irregular fighters, no one later agreed which. He argued with them as if talk could shift the outcome. One struck him down, and they stripped what he carried.

His kin retrieved the body and brought it to the village church. Father Georgios read the prayers, incense rose, and Hanna was wrapped and placed in the ground near other village dead, with the sign of the cross traced over him and a small lamp lit from the household oil.
