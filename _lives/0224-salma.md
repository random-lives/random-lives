#     moment: Tag-along toddler at the patron’s compound

#     detail: 'In the evening, she repeats simple words—''Amma'' and ''pani''—and echoes
#       the ending of a short du''a after her grandmother. But she startles easily:
#       if a dog barks or wind hits the reed door, she whimpers and insists on being
#       held. The grandmother rubs her belly and says a protective phrase, and Salma
#       quiets only when her fingers find the edge of a small cloth amulet pouch tied
#       to her shirt.'

Salma was born on August 29, 1349, in a Sindhi-speaking hamlet north of the Indus bends in what is now Ghotki district, under the reach of the Delhi Sultanate’s officers and local chiefs who collected dues and kept armed men. Her mother, Amina, lived in her own mother’s house and worked as attached help in the compound of Haji Qasim, a local notable with fields and dependents. Salma’s father, Rashid, served as a guard in that same circle and did not take Amina as a recognized wife. In the room where Salma slept, women spoke quietly about earlier babies who had died at birth—Yusuf, Hasan, Musa, Umar—names said at the end of prayers.

The household that held Salma together was her mother’s kin. Bibi Mariam ran the hearth and water jars. Zahra, an adult sister, watched Salma most days. Two older brothers were alive: Ibrahim, already a working man, and Karim, a youth who came and went. Salma followed noise. If someone entered the yard she called out and went toward them on fast, unsteady feet, then grabbed at whatever they carried.

In March 1351 Amina brought her to Haji Qasim’s compound while she scrubbed pots and swept. Salma trailed behind and clutched a brass water pot by its rim. When a servant woman, Sajida, tried to pull it away, Salma shrieked, slapped, and twisted her body to keep it. A chicken flapped close and she dropped the pot and cried until Zahra lifted her and let her pat a tied goat kid. Salma laughed, then kept one fist locked in Zahra’s skirt.

By the winter of 1351 she said “Amma” and “pani,” and echoed the last words of a short du’a after Bibi Mariam. Sudden sounds still broke her. A dog bark at the reed door sent her scrambling into arms, fingers searching for the small amulet pouch tied to her shirt.

In late June 1352 her belly swelled and she passed worms and thin stool; she stopped eating and drinking. On July 4, 1352, she died in the house. They washed her, wrapped her in cloth, and buried her outside the settlement with a brief prayer facing west.
