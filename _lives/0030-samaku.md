# Debug information (not displayed on page):
# Age at death: 58
# Agreeableness (% rank): 83
# Birth date: November 12, 26360 BC
# Birth year: 26360 BC
# Climate now: Today the Egypt–Sudan Nile corridor is hot and extremely arid outside
#   the river, with true desert conditions dominating the surrounding landscape. Habitable,
#   productive land is concentrated almost entirely along the irrigated floodplain and
#   river margins.
# Climate then: Around 26360 BC (late Pleistocene), the Nile Valley sat near the transition
#   into the African Humid Period, so conditions were generally cooler than today and
#   often somewhat wetter or more seasonally variable, with stronger river flow than
#   in extreme arid phases. Vegetation beyond the floodplain was still limited, but
#   there were more frequent opportunities for grass/shrub cover and usable water sources
#   in nearby depressions and wadis than in the hyperarid modern desert.
# Conscientiousness (% rank): 16
# Cultural tradition: undifferentiated
# Death date: August 7, 26301 BC
# Environment: A narrow ribbon of riverine habitat (channels, floodplain, and levees)
#   bordered closely by desert, with patches of reeds and riverbank woodland and nearby
#   wadis/oases used seasonally for hunting and gathering. People would have relied
#   heavily on the Nile’s water, fish, waterfowl, and small game, with movement between
#   river margins and adjacent desert-steppe zones as conditions allowed.

#     drying
#   timing: repeated episodes, most likely ages 15–45
# - event: Localized outbreak of water-associated gastrointestinal illness in the band
#     linked to stagnant backwaters or contaminated drinking points (non-lethal for
#     most, disruptive for weeks)
#   timing: multiple times across life; especially adulthood
# - event: High parasite burden period (e.g., schistosome-like exposure, intestinal
#     worms) leading to community-level fatigue/anemia and changes in water-contact
#     practices (favoring certain landing spots or boiling/settling water when feasible)
#   timing: adulthood, recurring seasonally
# - event: A short cold/dry spell (weeks to a season) reducing riverbank vegetation
#     and small game near camp, increasing travel costs and reliance on fishing/weirs/traps

The Nile she knew ran through a cooler world than the one there now. The river spread into side channels and backwaters, with reed beds and patches of trees along the banks. Beyond the floodplain the land turned open and dry, but after rain the low places held water for a while and the wadis carried damp sand and short grass.

“Samaku” is a stand-in. Her name is gone with her voice.

She was born on a levee above a side channel, the fifth of six. Her earliest memory of her father was his hands, slick with fish, and the way he passed good pieces to other people before taking any for himself. He was there, then he wasn’t. Her mother lasted a little longer. After that, Samaku slept where space opened and followed whichever adult reached for her wrist.

Her aunt took her in without ceremony. The shelter was a low frame of poles and reed bundles, patched and re-tied when the wind worried it loose. Everyone’s things were close together: baskets, hide wraps, stone flakes, cords, and the gourds they carried water in. Samaku lost track of small items and got sent back to look for them. When someone told her to mind the water container by the fire, she wandered off and came back to find it tipped and half gone. She didn’t argue. She said she was sorry, too fast and too often, and tried again.

One year the river rose and kept rising. Water crept into the sleeping place. Poles shifted. Reed walls sagged and started to smell of rot. They moved the children and the bundles up onto higher ground and waited out the worst of it in a tight cluster on the levee. Shallow pools sat behind new sandbars and the air buzzed with insects. People slept in short stretches, hands slapping at skin in the dark. Samaku learned what it meant when the river changed its mind.

As she grew, she stayed close to other people. She was seldom alone unless she was sent for water. When she did go, she came back with something to say: birds lifting from a bend, a line of tracks pressed into wet sand, a place where the bank had broken away and the current ran faster. She talked her way through a day. If she had nothing useful, she brought a story anyway.

After the rains, when the desert-side wadis greened for a short time, she went with the groups that moved out to hunt and gather. The trips were quick. Grass came up, then dried. Game concentrated, then scattered. Samaku watched the ground and the sky and pushed for leaving early, before another band arrived. When someone resisted, she didn’t square up to them. She went to the person who could sway the rest and wore them down with talk and small offerings—dried fish, a share of fat, whatever she could put in a hand. It didn’t work every time. When it did, she acted as if it had been someone else’s idea.

She took one partner and kept him. He worked in a steady way she didn’t have: careful with cords, patient with set-lines and fish traps, slow to waste effort. He checked her when she rushed. She pulled him toward the group when he would have sat apart.

They had four children over the years. The first, a girl, died small. Samaku wrapped the body and held it until her arms went numb, then handed her over when an older woman reached for her. After that she put herself back into the day. She didn’t turn grief into a display. She kept moving because stopping made her feel exposed.

The river fed them and it made them sick. In the still backwaters the water went bad. A few times each year stomach sickness ran through the camp. Children started it—vomiting, then watery stool that didn’t stop—and adults followed. Samaku moved between shelters carrying water, wiping mouths, rinsing soiled skins in small careful pours. She sat too close and touched too much. She caught it, too, and when she recovered she went straight back to the same work.

People changed where they drank. They walked farther for clearer runs and took water from places with moving current. Samaku agreed in words and broke the rule in practice. She hated extra trips. If she was tired, if the sun was high, if someone called her name from the shelter, she filled her gourd from the nearest edge and told herself it would be fine.

There were seasons when parasites wore the camp down. Bellies swelled. Skin dulled. People tired quickly even when there was food. Samaku grew thin in those months and snapped at the children when they clung to her legs. Then she tried to patch it over with jokes and gifts and attention, as if she could cover the bruise with noise.

During another high-water season she went to a flooded reed edge to check a fish trap. The bank under her feet broke away without warning. She dropped into cold moving water and swallowed silt. Her partner came hard down the slope and caught her arm as she went under again. He dragged her out onto mud and held her while she coughed and shook.

After that she moved stiffly for weeks, ribs sore, temper sharp. She let other people carry heavy loads and hated herself for it. She apologized until her aunt told her to stop.

She grew into a senior woman anyway, not because she planned well, but because she was always in the middle of things. When someone came back angry from a failed hunt and started looking for a target, Samaku got between them and the nearest person. She asked questions that forced the anger to turn into a story. When younger men pushed at older ones over a fishing place, she put herself where they had to look at her while they spoke. She didn’t settle arguments cleanly. She slowed them down.

In her last summer the back channels near camp turned foul after days of heat and still water. The band shifted their drinking place to a clearer stretch. Samaku kept going to the closer spot. She did it out of habit, and because she thought she could take what other people couldn’t.

The cramps started two days later. Then the watery stool. She tried to keep walking and talking and doing small tasks, as if she could ignore it into stopping. Her legs shook when she stood. She refused to lie down until she collapsed and couldn’t get back up without help.

They brought her water in sips. Someone held her shoulders when the cramps hit. Her mouth went dry and her eyes stayed open too long between blinks.

On an August morning, with the river low enough that the mud at the edge cracked in the sun, she stopped answering when people spoke to her. She stared at the bright strip of water beyond the reed wall. Her breathing turned shallow and fast, then slowed. By midday it ended.
