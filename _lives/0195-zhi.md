#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 27
#     connection: Begins after he gains trust to manage boat cargo and market exchanges;

#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   - age: 32
#     connection: Occurs amid heightened market traffic and strained neighbor relations
#       after a mediocre harvest year; the theft reinforces Zhi’s controlling storage
#       practices and suspicion toward outsiders.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-7
#     key_events:
#     - Raised in a busy joint household under grandfather Mao’s strict routines; learns
#       early to follow schedules and avoid waste (c. -493 to -486).
#     - Witnesses infant brother Nuo’s brief illness and death (age 8; year -485 to
#       -484), setting a household fear of child-fever seasons.
#     - Begins accompanying men to fields/nearby landing, learning measures, ropes,
#       and storage practices (age 6-7).
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 8-17
#     key_events:
#     - Grandfather Mao dies, followed by grandmother Qin; household roles reshuffle
#       and Zhi is pushed into early responsibility (ages 16-19; -477 to -474).
#     - 'Chu administrative demands become more visible: levies and occasional corvée;
#       Zhi learns to comply outwardly while minimizing losses (ages 15-17 onward).'
#     - First notable drought/poor yield year (place within this phase) increases grain
#       price anxiety and strengthens attention to storage and accounting-by-memory
#       (approx. age 14; around -479).
#     phase: Later childhood & adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-30
#     key_events:
#     - Marriage to Xiu from a nearby hamlet; she joins the joint household (age ~21;
#       -472).
#     - Birth of eldest daughter Wen; joy mixed with disappointment from elders over
#       no son (age 22; -471).
#     - 'Expansion of market exchange: more trips to market landings; Zhi becomes a
#       dependable organizer and negotiator despite illiteracy (ages 20-30).'
#     - Begins the recurring pattern of under-reporting loads/avoiding minor dues in
#       transport trade (starts age 27; -466).
#     phase: Young adulthood
#   - age_range: 31-45
#     key_events:
#     - 'Winter storage-season break-in: grain and tools stolen; Zhi presses for restitution
#       but cannot prove it (age 32-33; -461 to -460).'
#     - Daughters Jia and Biao die young; one prolonged illness episode requires sustained
#       caregiving and mobilizes women’s networks for remedies (ages 25-33, concentrated
#       around -460).
#     - 'Public works/corvée episode: labor demanded for embankment/drainage or transport
#       provisioning, disrupting planting schedules (place c. age 35-38; -458 to -455).'
#     - Father Hemu dies; Zhi and Rong renegotiate household leadership and shares,
#       with Zhi protecting status through ritual sponsorship and reputation management
#       (age 42; -451).
#     phase: Mid-adulthood
#   - age_range: 46-55

#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Stability and predictability in the household, but occasional missed
#       opportunities during market expansion; conflicts with more adventurous younger
#       men.
#     scene: Rejects experimenting with unfamiliar seed/field methods suggested by a
#       trader; insists on ancestral timing for planting and ritual, and distrusts novel
#       practices from other hamlets.
#     timing: Adolescence into adulthood (age 15–35)
#     trait: Very low Openness (4th percentile)
#   - consequence: Household remains better-off and resilient; also creates tension
#       as others experience him as controlling and rigid.
#     scene: Runs meticulous routines for drying grain, rotating stores, and assigning
#       labor; notices missing tools quickly and enforces strict repayment of borrowed
#       implements.
#     timing: All adult phases, especially mid-adulthood (age 25–45)
#     trait: Very high Conscientiousness (97th percentile)
#   - consequence: Maintains alliances and reduces open feuding; helps him avoid formal
#       punishment despite borderline behaviors.
#     scene: Mediates disputes with neighboring kin groups using soft speech and gift-giving,
#       presenting himself as reasonable and peace-seeking even when privately resentful.
#     timing: Young to mid-adulthood (age 20–45)
#     trait: Very high Agreeableness (96th percentile)
#   - consequence: Short-term material gain and maintained status; heightened anxiety
#       about exposure and increased need to manage reputation via ritual sponsorship
#       and public generosity.
#     scene: Uses charm and plausible excuses with toll-collectors and intermediaries,
#       under-reporting loads; privately frames it as 'protecting the household' rather
#       than wrongdoing.
#     timing: Young adulthood through midlife (age 27–41)
#     trait: Low Honesty-Humility (10th percentile)
#   - consequence: He remains socially functional and even respected, but intimate relationships
#       (wife, brother) carry an undercurrent of mistrust; conflicts surface as passive
#       resistance and quiet score-keeping rather than open fights.
#     scene: Cultivates a public image of dutiful mediator while quietly manipulating
#       exchange terms (weights, timing, intermediaries) to advantage himself; shows
#       limited remorse, focusing instead on not being caught and on maintaining honor.
#     timing: Most visible in adulthood (age 25–45), especially during market trips

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During the winter storage season, someone broke into the joint household’s
#     grain shed while most men were away at a nearby landing and stole several baskets
#     of millet/rice and a few iron tools; the family suspected a neighboring hamlet’s
#     men but could not prove it to the local headman.
#   reasoning: A better-off household with stored grain, tools, and livestock is an
#     attractive target; petty theft and fraud in local trade networks were common enough
#     over a 55-year life.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 32–33
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: While moving grain and fish by small boat to a market settlement, he repeatedly
#     avoided part of the expected dues by landing at an informal bank and selling through
#     an intermediary, under-reporting his load when questioned by a local toll-collector.
#   reasoning: Opportunities for minor tax evasion, smuggling/untaxed transport, boundary
#     encroachment, or illicit taking were common for farmers/boat-associated households,
#     and his low honesty-humility raises risk despite high conscientiousness.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: recurring pattern from age 27–41
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime

Zhi was born into the wet lowlands near the great lakes and channels that fed the middle Yangtze, where Chu authority pressed southward through levies, work details, and local headmen. His household spoke the same Sinitic tongue used in markets and by minor officials, but his family kept older local customs in their kitchens and at their field edges, with offerings placed where water met earth.

He entered a joint household ruled by his father’s father, Mao. The men slept in one long room off the main courtyard and the women in another; smoke from cooking fires clung to rafters blackened by years of millet steaming. The family held land above the lowest flood line and kept a few pigs and a pair of working oxen. Every evening Mao checked ropes, baskets, and the clay stoppers for storage jars. Zhi learned early that everything had a place. If a hoe went missing, Mao found the boy who last used it, and the boy paid for it with extra days in the fields.

Zhi’s mother, Yan, kept the household fed. She tended a garden strip behind the house—greens, gourds, and scallions—and she made the thin fermented paste that went into soups when fish were scarce. She expected Zhi to help with fuel and water even while he was small. When he returned from the canal with a sloshing bucket, she looked at the spill marks on his legs and counted them aloud, turning it into a joke that still ended with him fetching more.

Aru came two years after Zhi, then Shao two years after that. Zhi watched them take on chores almost as soon as they could carry a basket. Rong was born when Zhi was six, and for a time Zhi treated him as a toy he could order about. The last baby, Nuo, arrived when Zhi was eight. Nuo did not reach the next winter. The child’s coughing began after a cold rain; Qin, Zhi’s grandmother, laid warmed stones at the infant’s feet and tied a red thread at his wrist. The offerings at the threshold—steamed grain and a cup of thin ale for the ancestors—did not change the outcome. Afterward, Zhi stopped asking why adults watched babies so closely.

As Zhi entered his teens, Chu demands felt closer. Men from the district seat came to count grain and measure cloth, and the headman Tao began appearing in the village more often. Zhi learned to stand quietly when older men spoke. He kept his eyes on hands instead of faces; he noticed who carried the measuring cord and who carried the rod, and he remembered which one bent rules for a gift.

A drought year struck when he was fourteen. The channels shrank and the soil cracked where it usually held damp. Grain prices rose in the market settlement downriver. Mao ordered stricter meals—more greens, less grain—and Zhi took it as a problem to solve. He checked jar seals twice a day and chased chickens away from drying mats with a stick he kept by the door. Aru teased him for caring about mats like they were people; he answered with a dry smile and kept working.

Mao died when Zhi was sixteen. Qin followed three years later. Their deaths changed the house more than any official order. Hemu became the senior man and stopped waiting for instruction. Zhi began leading crews of younger boys to cut reeds and repair fish traps, then to clear silted ditches on family land. Hemu took him to the landing where household boats were tied and taught him how to judge a load by the waterline and how to tie a knot that held after soaking.

Zhi married at twenty-one. Xiu came from a nearby hamlet, walking in with her hair bound and a bundle of cloth and cooking tools slung over her shoulder. There was no elaborate ceremony; the household offered grain and meat at the ancestors’ place in the main room, and Tao took a small gift to record the match in his memory and in the village’s informal order. Zhi treated Xiu with careful politeness, as if every word might be repeated. He brought her the best pieces of carp when the boats came in and expected the household to notice.

Their first child, Wen, arrived the next year. Zhi held the infant briefly, then passed her to Qin’s sister, an older woman who still lived in the joint household. Wen survived her early fevers and grew into a quiet, observant girl who learned to count bundles and recognize which jar held which grain. Zhi took satisfaction in that. He began bringing Wen to the storehouse doorway, pointing with his chin instead of his finger, as if training her was also training the household to respect his arrangements.

A second daughter, Jia, was born when Zhi was twenty-five. Three years later a third, Biao. Between births, Zhi traveled more. Market exchange expanded; more boats moved along the channels carrying salt, fish, grain, and bundles of cloth. A broker named Zan worked the landing near the market settlement. Zan laughed easily and spoke quickly, and Zhi enjoyed sitting with him at dusk after unloading, eating grilled fish skin and drinking weak ale. Zan made crude jokes about toll collectors and could repeat them in three different voices. Zhi rarely laughed loud, but he kept returning.

At twenty-seven Zhi began to shave small amounts off what the household owed. When he brought grain and dried fish to market, he landed at an informal bank instead of the checkpoint and sold through Zan, letting Zan claim a share of the load as his own. When Zuo, a petty collector, questioned him on another trip, Zhi spoke softly about water loss and spoiled baskets, then offered a small gift of fish. He kept his face calm and his shoulders relaxed, as if he had no interest in winning. He went home with more grain than he should have, and the household ate better that month.

Jia fell ill when Zhi was thirty-two. It began with vomiting and loose stools. Xiu stayed near the child day and night, and Zhi took over tasks that would normally be handled by women: boiling water, pounding grain into thinner porridge, cleaning bedding. He fetched Yao, a healer who carried bundles of bitter leaves and a polished stone used in divination. Yao burned stalks and read cracks, then left instructions for teas and a small offering at the canal bend—two eggs and a pinch of salt. Zhi arranged it precisely and returned to sit by Jia, counting her breaths for a while before stopping himself. She died at eight.

That same winter, when Zhi was thirty-two, theft struck the household. Most men were away at a landing to negotiate a transport job when someone broke into the grain shed. Several baskets of millet and rice were gone, along with a few iron tools. Zhi examined the latch and the footprints in packed earth until lantern light failed. He went to Tao with gifts and a tidy story and heard Tao repeat the village rule: suspicion without proof produced only quarrels. Zhi named Pao, a household head from a neighboring hamlet, as the one who would have benefited. Tao nodded and did nothing.

After that, Zhi ordered new routines. Tools were counted at dusk. Grain jars were sealed twice. Younger men grumbled; he answered in calm tones and offered extra ale at seasonal rites so they could not say he was stingy. Biao died before her second winter, and soon after, two babies—Danu at birth and Kalu at birth—did not live to see a naming day. Zhi’s father’s kin argued with Xiu’s natal kin over whether impurity or neglect had caused it. Zhi ended the talk by paying for a small pig to be offered at the earth altar near the fields and by insisting the household speak one way in public.

Corvée calls came during his middle years. Zhi went with other men to pile earth for embankments and to clear channels, then returned to organize planting as if the disruption were another task to schedule. He disliked new methods suggested by men returning from distant work camps. He planted by the familiar timing and watched the sky, cursing under his breath at any change in wind before a harvest.

Hemu died when Zhi was forty-two. The funeral followed household means: washing, binding, and burial with offerings of grain and a simple jar of ale. Afterward, Zhi and Rong divided duties without a public split. Zhi spoke to Tao first, then to the rest of the household, keeping his tone mild. In private, he kept careful count of Rong’s shares and corrected him on small things that mattered to ownership: boundary markers, which boat belonged to which line, whose ox had pulled whose plow.

Yan died when Zhi was forty-seven after a harsh fever season. Aru had died the year before, and Shao died when Zhi was fifty-three, leaving obligations for nieces and nephews that folded into the joint household. Zhi handled these duties competently. He brought the right gifts, arranged meals for visitors, and spoke conciliatory words that kept ties smooth. He also steered exchanges so that debts owed to his line were remembered and debts he owed were blurred.

Wen grew into adulthood. Without sons, Zhi treated her marriages talks as a form of protection for his standing. He bargained for a match that kept her close to the household network, pressing terms through Tao and through Zan’s market connections.

At fifty-five, after returning from the fields, Zhi sat on a low bench near the courtyard wall and began speaking to Rong about the next planting. His words stopped mid-sentence. He collapsed sideways, one arm folded under him. The household buried him on higher ground beyond the field edge, and they set bowls of grain and strips of dried fish at the grave, calling his name once and then turning back to the work that needed doing.
