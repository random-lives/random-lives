Kʷàna was born at the end of the rainy season in a small farming settlement in the warm dry-forest hills of what is now Morelos. No king ruled the place. Elders from a few lineages settled disputes, organized shared work, and spoke an Oto‑Manguean tongue. People traded stone and pottery along footpaths that linked scattered villages.

His father, Tóku, kept the household’s fields. He cleared brush with a stone blade, planted maize with a digging stick, and stored dried ears in a raised basketed crib near the house. The family had better pots than most and extra gourds for carrying water. His mother, Ñùku, worked close to the hearth. She ground maize on a stone, cooked gruel, twisted fibers into cord, and wove mats that served as bedding and as trade goods. At dawn she placed a pinch of food by the hearth stones and rubbed ash between her fingers before she ate.

Kʷàna was their first child. He spent his days wrapped against Ñùku’s chest or laid on a reed mat in the shade while she worked. When the rains eased, water in the shallow containers warmed quickly. Flies gathered. Kʷàna began passing watery stool. Ñùku tried thinner gruel, then only breastmilk. Tóku brought water from the nearest spring and heated stones to warm it, but the child kept emptying himself.

On the first day of the next month, Kʷàna lay limp on the mat. His mouth stayed dry. By midday he no longer cried.
