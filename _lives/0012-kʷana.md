Kʷàna was born in late summer in a small farming settlement on the warm, dry slopes above the river valleys in what is now Morelos. No king ruled there. Older men and women from the main lineages settled disputes and organized shared work when fields needed many hands. His family spoke an Oto-Manguean tongue and kept a household altar near the cooking hearth, where food and drink were set down before anyone ate.

His father, Tóku, managed the family’s plots. He cleared brush, set maize and beans in the soil with a digging stick, and stored last season’s grain in sealed jars inside their house. The family owned more good land than most nearby households, and they kept extra gourds, cordage, and stone blades for exchange. His mother, Sáma, worked close to home. She ground maize, cooked, carried water, and spun fiber into cord. She wove mats and bags and traded them for salt and dried chile when visitors came along the paths.

Kʷàna stayed on Sáma’s hip, then on a reed mat near the doorway while she worked. When he crawled, she tied a soft band at his waist to keep him from the hearth and the storage jars. Near his first rainy season, his stool turned watery and frequent. Sáma boiled thin maize gruel and gave him sips, then water. The diarrhea continued through the day and into the night. On August 1, 1646 BC, Kʷàna died in the house beside the hearth.
