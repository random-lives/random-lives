María Fernanda “Fer” Salas was born on January 15, 2021, in La Cruz, in the municipality of Frontera, Coahuila. The dry months left dust on the windowsill and heat in the room by noon. On her birth registration, only her mother’s name appeared. Fer grew up without a father in the house and without visits that needed explaining. When she asked, her mother ended the talk and went back to whatever had to get done.

Yadira worked packaging on a maquiladora line. She left before dawn with her hair still wet, a lunch wrapped in foil, and the bus fare counted into her palm. In 2021 the clinic required masks and temperature checks, and the waiting room stayed half empty, chairs blocked off with tape. Fer spent her first months in a rented back room behind a relative’s house, quiet except for the street and the neighbor’s radio.

Alma, her older sister, was four and treated the room like a small yard. She made games out of empty boxes and clothespins and a chipped plastic cup. Fer watched from the floor. She turned objects in her hands and studied the pictures on labels until she wore the edges soft. She lined bottle caps in tight rows by color, then knocked them loose and started again.

A small print of the Virgen de Guadalupe was taped high on the wall above a patch where the paint had not peeled. When the electricity cut out, Yadira lit a candle in a glass and said the same short prayers each time. On Sundays, if Yadira had the strength and the bus money, they went to Mass. If not, they stayed in, washed clothes, and waited for the next shift.

When Fer entered primary school, the classrooms were open again, but the household stayed precarious. She brought home worksheets and kept them clean. She asked why some letters were written but not said. She asked why the moon seemed to follow them along the road. At night she sat near the fan and traced the edge of a book with her fingertip, listening to Alma talk until Yadira told them both to sleep.
