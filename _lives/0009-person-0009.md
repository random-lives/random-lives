María Fernanda Salas García was born on January 15, 2021, in La Cruz, Frontera, in Coahuila. The days were hot most of the year. Dust collected on window ledges and under parked cars.

She was the second daughter. Alma was three years older and learned early to go quiet when adults talked about money.

Their mother, Yadira, raised them alone. Fer had no stable story about her father. There were no photos taped to the wall, no calls that came on a schedule, no visits that turned into a habit. When Fer asked about him once, Yadira answered in a short sentence and moved on. After that, Fer stopped asking.

The household ran on Yadira’s maquiladora shifts and whatever help came from an aunt next door: a bag of rice, a ride to the clinic, watching the girls when Yadira’s bus ran late. Yadira worked standing at a line, packing and sealing until her wrists ached. In 2021 and 2022 the factory still carried the rules that came after COVID—masks on the floor, temperature checks at the door, missed days when someone in the line tested positive. The supervisor counted absences out loud.

Fer grew up with the TV turned low and a phone that was used carefully, data measured day by day. Spanish filled the room: cartoons, scoldings, voice notes to relatives, prayers said without discussion. Religion showed up in the small things Yadira kept in place. An image of the Virgen de Guadalupe was taped above the bed. When the power went out, Yadira lit a candle in a glass and told the girls to stay close. Fer learned the sign of the cross before sleep. They went to Mass on some Sundays, when the week had not broken Yadira down first.

When Fer started primary school, her attention went where it wanted. She pulled at the corners of labels, stared at pictures on packaging, and asked what words meant until the adult answering her got tired. She left her own notebooks half-filled. She lost pencils and forgot permission slips on the table. When the teacher gave steps, Fer watched the window instead.

She did not smooth things over with other children. If someone took her eraser, she grabbed it back without bargaining. When the teacher sent her to stand by the wall, Fer stood there with her jaw set and her eyes dry. She stayed at the edge of games, listening. If the rules changed, she walked off.

By eight, in 2029, she knew how to get across Frontera by recognizing buses and the places they stopped, because she rode with her mother to errands when there was no one else to leave her with. In the evening, while Yadira reheated tortillas on the comal, Fer sat on the tile with one of Alma’s schoolbooks open in front of her, turning pages slowly. She traced the pictures with one finger until Yadira told her to eat.
