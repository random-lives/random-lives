#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: 1378
#     name: Bera
#     narrative_role: Mixed smallholder (herding + grain). Affection expressed through
#       provisioning rather than tenderness; strict and reputation-minded. Likely dies
#       in late 50s/60s during the unstable 1370s, increasing household precarity just
#       before/around Tana’s marriage.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: 1404
#     name: Nisa
#     narrative_role: 'Primary teacher of work routines and prayers; hardworking and
#       anxious about shortages. Relationship: close but demanding—expects endurance.
#       Lives long enough to see Tana’s separation and helps shelter her afterward.'
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: 1369
#     name: Vesna
#     narrative_role: Elder voice in the hearth; leads small protective practices (crossing
#       oneself, charms) and enforces norms. Warmth mixed with criticism; her death
#       marks Tana’s first clear memory of communal mourning.
#     role: paternal grandmother (co-resident elder)
#   - death_year: 1388
#     name: Ansa
#     narrative_role: Extra adult labor in the patrilocal household; sometimes quarrelsome,
#       drinks at feasts, but contributes to herding. Serves as a link to Kipchak-speaking
#       trade/contacts.

#     death_age: 38
#     death_year: 1408
#     name: Roxa
#     narrative_role: Only child to reach adulthood; emotionally important to Tana.
#       As a girl she helps keep the household afloat; as a young woman she is a hope
#       for security, then her death (likely illness/complications) is a defining grief.

#     death_year: 1376
#     name: Suraq
#     narrative_role: Second infant son who dies at/near birth; a further blow that
#       precedes the final deterioration of the marriage.
#     sex: M
#   incident_placements:

#     connection: Begins soon after marriage when shortages and accusations arise; worsens
#       after the first infant son’s death and during her husband’s absences.
#     incident: domestic_violence
#   - age: 26
#     connection: Escalation phase; she seeks temporary refuge at in-laws’ hearth after
#       a beating, foreshadowing final separation.
#     incident: domestic_violence
#   - age: 28
#     connection: After separation (loss of bridewealth protection), herd sickness and
#       seed-grain debt bind her to a patron; overlaps with petty theft pattern.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 27
#     connection: Recurring small grain-taking during lean springs while working threshing
#       for a better-off kinsman; framed as survival and informal wage.
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   - age: 29
#     connection: Triggered by grazing damage dispute and rumors of theft during the
#       economic crisis; reinforces her cautious, inward, vigilant habits.
#     incident: physical_assault
#   - age: 41
#     connection: Fall from/jolt of ox-cart during harvest transport when extended household
#       is labor-stretched; leads to months of incapacity and longer-term aches.
#     incident: serious_accident
#   - age: 45
#     connection: Persistent cough and breathlessness worsen each winter due to smoke

#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6 (1349-1355)
#     key_events:
#     - Raised in a patrilocal extended household; learns prayers, taboos, and fear
#       of infant sickness through stories of dead siblings.
#     - Begins small tasks (carrying water, watching small animals) under older sister
#       Sana’s supervision.
#     - Periodic rumors of disease and tribute collectors passing through the wider
#       district (background anxiety in adults).
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 7-18 (1356-1367)
#     key_events:
#     - 'Work intensifies: field help at planting/harvest, spinning and food processing;
#       bilingual exposure grows through traders/herders (Iranian at home, Kipchak in
#       dealings).'
#     - Household faces intermittent shortages and livestock sickness; she becomes careful
#       with stores and routines.
#     - Marriage arranged in late teens into a nearby household; leaves natal hearth
#       but remains in the same local area.
#     phase: Later childhood & adolescence
#   - age_range: 19-45 (1368-1394)
#     key_events:
#     - 'Marriage to Yanaq: first years include childbirth and heavy labor; domestic
#       violence becomes recurring (ages 19-28).'
#     - Separation/abandonment occurs (around 1377), after infant losses and escalating
#       conflict; she returns to kin and lives precariously.

#     key_events:
#     - Regional turmoil and insecurity intensify in the mid-1390s (news of major campaigns,
#       disrupted markets); household becomes more cautious about travel and storage.
#     - Serious accident during harvest transport leaves her with long recovery (ages
#       41-42 already placed earlier; lingering weakness persists into later years).
#     - Chronic winter cough/breathlessness begins around 45 and continues; she shifts
#       toward lighter but constant work (spinning, food processing).
#     phase: Middle age
#   - age_range: 60-77 (1409-1426)
#     key_events:

#       news and phrases
#   partners:
#   - name: Yanaq
#     narrative_role: Husband from a nearby household. Relationship begins with practical
#       alliance; turns controlling and violent, especially during shortages and accusations
#       over stores. Final rupture is abandonment/separation (he leaves or sends her
#       back) rather than widowhood.

#   - birth_year: 1352
#     death_age: 31
#     death_year: 1383
#     name: Ratag
#     narrative_role: Younger brother; does herding and seasonal work. Protective of
#       Tana in youth but later pulled into adult obligations; his death at 31 reduces
#       the kin safety net during her early middle age.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Heightened vigilance helps prevent some losses (spoilage/theft) but
#       also fuels marital conflict and chronic worry that neighbors read as suspicion.
#     scene: She repeatedly checks stored grain and re-ties sacks, wakes at night to
#       listen for animals and coughing children, and interprets minor symptoms as the
#       start of another deadly fever.
#     timing: adolescence through adult life (ages ~12-40), resurging during winters
#       in old age
#     trait: Neuroticism (77th percentile)
#   - consequence: Makes her valuable in extended households and during crises; can
#       also make her seem rigid and provoke disputes with lazier/resentful relatives.
#     scene: Even when injured or ill, she keeps a strict routine—rekindling the hearth
#       early, portioning food precisely, finishing spinning quotas—and expects the
#       same from younger relatives.
#     timing: all phases, especially after separation (ages ~28+)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (84th percentile)
#   - consequence: Maintains a tolerable reputation despite poverty; earns trust for
#       caregiving and for handling small household stores.
#     scene: She insists on returning labor/gifts after taking grain so she is not seen
#       as a shameless thief; she avoids boastful talk and credits saints/kin rather
#       than herself for survival.
#     timing: adult life (ages ~26-40) and old age
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (86th percentile)
#   - consequence: Contributes to escalation of disputes (including the watering-place
#       assault) and makes reconciliation with her husband’s kin harder.
#     scene: In arguments she is blunt and not easily soothed; she will publicly contradict
#       a neighbor over grazing boundaries and refuses to ‘smile it away.’
#     timing: adult life during crisis years (ages ~27-33)
#     trait: Low Agreeableness (37th percentile)
#   - consequence: Improves practical navigation of mixed-language settings, but some
#       elders view her curiosity as ‘restless’ or improper.
#     scene: She is curious about travelers’ words and adopts a few Kipchak phrases
#       for bargaining; she listens to new saints’ stories and tries small protective
#       practices suggested by outsiders.
#     timing: adolescence and early adulthood (ages ~14-25)
#     trait: Openness (70th percentile) expressed within constraints
#   - consequence: Increases vulnerability to being shortchanged and makes her over-dependent
#       on patrons/kin; also drives her meticulous, repetitive checking behaviors.
#     scene: She struggles with complex bargaining/accounting and is easily confused
#       by multi-step instructions, so she relies on fixed routines, memorized measures,
#       and more capable kin for negotiations.
#     timing: visible in adolescence onward; most consequential during economic crisis
#       (ages ~27-31)
#     trait: Very low Intelligence (6th percentile) as practical limitation
# number_of_children: '3'
# number_of_siblings: '5'
# occupation: Subsistence household worker in a peasant/smallholder farmstead (food
#   processing, childcare, textiles, garden, small livestock; helps in fields at peak
#   seasons)
# religion: Folk Christianity (Orthodox-leaning) with home prayers, saints’ days kept,
#   occasional church rites when available (baptism/marriage), plus protective charms

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During a lean spring she quietly took a small sack of millet/barley from
#     a better-off kinsman’s storehouse after helping with threshing, intending it as
#     ‘payment’ for work and to feed her children; she avoided open accusation by returning
#     labor and small gifts later.
#   reasoning: In chronic poverty, small-scale “everyday” illicit acts (pilfering, taking
#     wood/forage, minor evasion of dues) were fairly common, though her personality
#     profile reduces the likelihood of repeated intentional offending.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: recurring pattern, ages 26–33
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime
# - event: After her husband left and bridewealth support dried up, her household lost
#     animals to disease and then had to pledge a portion of the next harvest to a patron
#     to obtain seed grain, leaving them close to destitution for several seasons.
#   reasoning: She remained an impoverished commoner reliant on kin/patrons and experienced
#     marital breakdown; across a long life this makes at least one episode of destitution/debt/property
#     loss quite likely.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: sustained period, ages 27–31
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: Her husband periodically beat her during disputes over missing grain and
#     his absences, once striking her hard enough that she hid at her in-laws’ hearth
#     for days; the violence escalated before the eventual separation.
#   reasoning: Intimate-partner violence was widespread historically and is especially
#     plausible given that her marriage ended in separation/abandonment rather than
#     widowhood and she remained poor and dependent.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: recurring pattern, ages 19–28
#   type: domestic_violence
# - event: At a watering place/track near the fields, she was knocked down and kicked
#     by a neighbor’s wife and male relative during a quarrel over grazing damage and
#     accusations of theft, leaving her bruised and limping for weeks.
#   reasoning: Non-domestic assault could occur via disputes, inter-household conflicts,
#     or raid-related encounters, but for women it was generally less frequent than
#     domestic violence over the life course.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: single event, age 29
#   type: physical_assault
# - event: While helping with harvest transport, an ox-cart jolted in a rut and she
#     fell awkwardly, badly injuring her ankle/hip; she could not work the fields or
#     walk far for much of the season and had to rely on kin for food.
#   reasoning: Agricultural and livestock work (animals, carts, falls, tools) created
#     real risk of a serious injury with prolonged incapacity, though not inevitable.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: single event with long recovery, ages 41–42
#   type: serious_accident
# - event: From middle age she developed a persistent winter cough and breathlessness
#     that worsened with smoke-filled indoor fires, flaring after colds and limiting
#     heavy work, though she continued lighter tasks like food processing and spinning.
#   reasoning: Smoke exposure, recurring infections, hard labor, and poor nutrition
#     make a long-lived rural woman fairly likely to have had an ongoing condition (chronic
#     cough, joint disease, recurrent fevers).
#   tier: 2
#   timing: sustained chronic condition with flare-ups, ages 45–77
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: She spent months nursing an older female relative in the extended household—washing,
#     feeding gruel, tending sores, and keeping the hearth warm—until the woman either
#     recovered partially or died, while other adults were away with herds or in the
#     fields.
#   reasoning: Extended-extended households commonly relied on women for prolonged nursing
#     of ill/injured relatives; her long lifespan makes at least one sustained caregiving
#     episode quite plausible.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: sustained caregiving period, ages 60–61
#   type: sick_relative
---

Tana was born in early September of 1349 in the open grasslands north of the Caucasus, where Alan villages and camps sat on the edge of the Golden Horde’s reach. Tribute collectors and drovers moved along the tracks; news arrived in Kipchak words as often as in her own Iranian speech. At the hearth her family crossed themselves in the Orthodox way, kept a few saints’ days when a priest appeared, and tied small charms to cradles and doorposts against sickness.

Her earliest world was a crowded yard: her father Bera, her mother Nisa, Bera's mother Vesna, and Bera's unmarried brother Ansa under the same roofline and fence. Sana, the older sister who lived, was already walking and talking when Tana arrived. There had been three tiny graves before Tana's birth—two boys and a girl who did not live past their first years—and the household spoke of those infants in short phrases and then turned back to work. A younger brother, Ratag, was born when Tana was three. Vesna kept a small bag of salt and dried herb by the rafters and insisted it be touched to a baby's swaddling before the child was carried outside.

Tana grew quick in her hands, less so in her understanding. Sana could learn a new knot after being shown once; Tana needed it shown again, then again, until her fingers remembered without her head. She made up for it with routine. She rose when the coals were still dull, shook ash from the hearth, and set the pot before anyone asked. When Nisa sent her for water she went the same path, counted steps in her head, and returned without spilling.

She learned two ways of speaking early. At home the talk stayed in the Alan tongue: short commands, names for relatives, prayers. Ansa helped with the herds and made trips to trade felt and tallow for salt and metal goods. When he came back from the track, his mouth shifted into Kipchak, and Tana listened hard. The trader Toghrul, who came with drovers each warm season, amused himself by teaching her phrases for measuring and bargaining. Sana teased her for repeating them under her breath while she spun. Tana did it anyway.

Bera treated sons and grain as matters of honor. When he spoke, the younger children stopped moving. He carried weight in his shoulders, kept his knife clean, and counted sacks after threshing. His affection arrived as food set down and a new pair of felt wraps in winter. Nisa gave affection through instruction—how much sour milk to add to porridge, how to rub a baby's gums with honey-water, how to keep a spinning whorl steady.

Tana's first clear memory of death came when Vesna died in 1369. The women washed the old body, crossed her hands, and laid her on boards while men dug beyond the yard. Father Giorgi, a priest who traveled between Alan settlements, murmured prayers; Nisa added bread and a small onion to the grave cloth before the earth went in.

By her teens Tana worked like an adult. In spring she bent in the fields and in the afternoons she carried dung cakes to dry, even when her back protested. At night she spun. She had a sharp temper when accused of doing a task wrong. Once, when an aunt laughed at her for miscounting a measure of grain, Tana snapped back loudly enough that Bera came in from outside and ended the quarrel with a hard look.

In 1368, with her father’s consent and a small exchange between households, she married Yanaq from a nearby settlement. She did not travel far; she could still recognize the hills and the bends of the track. The move changed her days. Her husband's yard held fewer people than her father's had, and she felt the empty spaces. Yanaq wanted order and obedience, but he also wanted drink at feasts and time away with men on errands. He counted her work as his due.

The beatings began in her second year of marriage. They started with words about missing grain, about her tongue, about who had visited the yard while he was away. He hit her with his open hand, then with a strap. She learned to keep her face blank and her eyes down, but she also argued when he accused her of theft or laziness. After a blow split her lip she went to his parents’ hearth and stayed three nights, sleeping on a mat by the wall. His mother pressed a cloth to her mouth, then scolded her for provoking him.

Roxa was born in 1370. Tana held the baby close, kept her near the hearth when it was cold, and touched the child’s forehead with a pinch of blessed salt she had saved from a feast day. Roxa grew into a sturdy girl who liked to sit by the doorway and listen to stories. When Toghrul came through again, he showed Roxa a coin with a stamped mark; Roxa laughed and tried to bite it. Tana laughed too, briefly, before she wrapped the child and returned to her work.

Two sons followed. The first, Ardan, lived only hours. The second, Suraq, born three years later, did not survive the night. After each burial Yanaq's anger sharpened. He said she had failed him. He accused her of bringing bad luck from her father's house. In 1377, after a winter of quarrels and another beating that left bruises across her ribs, he pushed her out. No elder intervened. He kept the bridewealth goods her family had given and sent nothing with her. She walked back to her mother's household with Roxa on her hip.

Bera died the following year, in 1378, and his household tightened further. Nisa took Tana in, but there was nothing to spare. That autumn, at a watering place on the track near the fields, a neighbor woman named Zarifa shouted that Tana's animals had grazed her plot and that grain had gone missing. Words turned to hands. Zarifa and a male relative knocked Tana down and kicked her. She crawled home with dirt on her face and pain in her side. Nisa washed her bruises and warned her to keep quiet. Tana did not keep quiet. She snapped at Zarifa the next time their paths crossed, and after that she avoided the track when she could.

The household lost animals to sickness that winter, then faced a spring with little seed. A patron kinsman named Khalmat offered grain on terms that bound them: a share of the next harvest and days of labor. Tana measured the seed into the furrows with careful hands, then went to help thresh in Khalmat's yard. In the lean springs that followed—1380, 1381, and after—she took small amounts of millet and barley from his store, one sack at a time, hiding it under her wrap. Each time she brought something back later—extra days of work, a skein of thread, a small bowl of curds—so that the taking would not become an open accusation. She kept count in knots on a cord because numbers slipped away from her when she tried to hold them in her head.

Ratag, her younger brother, died in 1383 after a sickness that moved through the herdsmen's camp. Ansa, her father's brother, followed in 1388. Those losses meant fewer hands for pasture work and fewer men to argue on her behalf. Still, Roxa grew and took on tasks early. Mother and daughter worked with little talk: milking, stirring porridge, rubbing fat into cracked hands in winter. Roxa teased Tana for her habit of tying the same knot twice. Tana replied with a rare joke, calling Roxa “little priest” when the girl tried to copy prayers with too much solemnity.

In 1390, during harvest transport, Tana fell from an ox-cart. The cart jolted into a rut; she landed badly and screamed. Her ankle swelled and her hip burned with pain. For months she could not walk far. She sat near the hearth, sorting grain, spinning, and directing Roxa in sharp, clipped instructions. Neighbors brought a little help, then stopped when their own work pressed. Tana learned to move with a stick and anger.

Four years later a winter cough settled into her chest. Smoke from the indoor fire made it worse. She wheezed after carrying water and had to stop and spit. In summers she managed, but each cold season the breathlessness returned. She shifted to indoor work and light tasks, keeping to routine with a stubbornness that irritated younger relatives.

Sana died in 1396. She had been the steadiest one, the sister who found Tana work and a place to sleep when the yard felt crowded. Sana's death came during years of louder news: talk of rival khans, collectors arriving with new demands, and the fear that armies moving somewhere far could turn into raiders closer by. When riders came through, Tana listened from behind a fence slat, catching Kipchak phrases and missing the rest. She went back to the stores and checked the sacks again.

Nisa, her mother, died in 1404. She had grown frail and slow, and at the end she lay on a mat near the hearth while Tana brought her water and wiped her face. After the burial Tana felt the absence in small ways: no one to remember the old prayers exactly, no one who had known the yard before all the deaths.

Roxa died in 1408 at thirty-eight. She had been a grown woman with her own place in the extended household, then illness took her quickly. After the burial Tana's work became smaller: keeping children from wandering into the cold, mending, cooking. She moved into a corner of a nephew's house, where a mat and a chest held everything she owned.

The following year an older woman in the extended household fell sick and could not rise. Tana washed her, changed cloths, fed her thin gruel, and kept the hearth warm. She did it day after day while others went to fields and herds. Her own cough rasped as she leaned over the sickbed. When impatience rose, she moved faster and said nothing.

The years after that passed without great change. She rose early, tended children too young to work, spun thread in the light from the doorway, and kept count of stores with her knotted cord. Her chest rattled each winter but cleared enough by spring to let her move. She attended burials—a nephew's wife, a cousin's infant—and murmured the prayers she had learned from Vesna. Younger relatives found her stubborn and sharp-tongued, but they also trusted her to measure grain fairly and to notice when a child ran a fever. She outlived most of the people who remembered her marriage and her separation. By her seventies she was the oldest woman in the yard.

In November of 1426, after a morning of coughing and sorting kindling by the hearth, Tana stood to fetch water and collapsed without warning. The women of the household washed her body, crossed her hands, and buried her beyond the yard with a short prayer, a pinch of salt, and bread set near the head cloth.
