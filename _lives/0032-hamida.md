Hamida was born on June 19, 1889, in a village in al-Minufiyah in the Nile Delta, under the Khedivate of Egypt and the British occupation that controlled the state’s finances and army. Her family were Arabic-speaking Muslim fellahin, tenants on a small plot they worked for a landlord’s share.

Her father, Hassan, rose before daylight to take the canal path to the fields. He argued with the overseer over measures and water turns and came home with mud on his calves. Her mother, Zaynab, carried the baby against her hip while she swept, baked flat bread, and then went out for fieldwork when cotton needed weeding. In the house were seven children besides Hamida, a tight row of bodies at night and constant noise in the day. The older boys, Mahmud and Ali, ran errands and watched the younger ones. Two small graves already lay at the edge of the cemetery for a sister and a brother who had died at three.

Hamida fed in the shade near the door and slept on a mat beside her mother. She was washed from a basin and swaddled against flies. In the winter of 1889, coughing started in the house and moved child to child. Hamida’s cough came in fits that left her rigid and silent between them. Zaynab held her upright and wiped her mouth with the corner of her scarf. On January 17, 1890, Hamida died in the house before midday.
