#     death_age: 67
#     death_year: -4898
#     name: Mina-2
#     narrative_role: Youngest surviving child; too young to remember pre-violence years
#       clearly. Represents Nomi’s late-life drive to secure the garden and household
#       against hunger and rivals.
#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 19
#     connection: Begins soon after/around her long-distance move; insecurity shapes
#       where gardens are planted and how stores are hidden.
#     incident: civilian_war_exposure
#   - age: 20
#     connection: Repeated evacuations normalize sleeping away from the hearth and caching
#       food; fuels hypervigilance.
#     incident: civilian_war_exposure
#   - age: 21
#     connection: A dawn raid intersects with the evacuation period; becomes a vivid
#       memory that triggers panic and checking.
#     incident: witnessed_atrocity
#   - age: 28
#     connection: Starts after cumulative pregnancies and wet-season sickness; reduces
#       stamina and increases reliance on older children.
#     incident: chronic_illness (onset)
#   - age: 24
#     connection: Lean seasons and competition among co-resident women push her to covertly
#       divert food; reinforced after child losses and fear of hunger.
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime (pattern begins)
#   - age: 29
#     connection: While building new plots, she sometimes re-labels others' stores as

#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime (continues)
#   - age: 31
#     connection: Fall on wet slope while carrying harvest; forces household reorganization
#       and increases tensions over food and labor.
#     incident: serious_accident
#   - age: 29
#     connection: Her seed-saving and plot management gains attention as climate variability
#       makes yields unpredictable; hosting/exchange becomes possible.
#     incident: major_achievement (recognition period begins)
#   - age: 35
#     connection: Despite illness and prior injury, her methods allow surplus contributions;
#       boosts her influence in household decisions.
#     incident: major_achievement (peak)
#   - age: 35
#     connection: Repartnering creates a blended household; disputes over allocation
#       and accusations escalate into beatings.
#     incident: domestic_violence (pattern begins)
#   - age: 39
#     connection: Violence intensifies during shortages and after infant deaths; she
#       intermittently flees to nearby kin for protection.
#     incident: domestic_violence (continues)

#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -5004
#     death_age: 36
#     death_year: -4968
#     name: Mina
#     narrative_role: Closest near-age sister; early co-helper in childcare and gathering.

#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -5002
#     death_age: 37
#     death_year: -4965
#     name: Tami
#     narrative_role: Practical, steady sister who often steadies the household during

#       as Nomi, underscoring the era’s harshness.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -5000
#     death_age: 23
#     death_year: -4977
#     name: Rina
#     narrative_role: Younger sister who reaches adolescence as tensions/raiding fears
#       rise. Her early death (likely illness/complication) becomes a reference point
#       for Nomi’s anxiety and rituals for ancestors.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -4998
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: -4998
#     name: Ala
#     narrative_role: Infant sister who dies soon after birth; remembered through household
#       mourning and later ancestor offerings.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -4997
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: -4997
#     name: Kina
#     narrative_role: Second infant loss; the repeated grief shapes Nomi’s sense that
#       danger is always near and fuels protective, controlling behavior.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Hypervigilance improves some practical preparedness but strains relationships,
#       fuels jealousy accusations, and contributes to exhaustion and irritability.
#     scene: She repeatedly checks caches and store-pits at dusk, imagines footsteps
#       on paths, wakes abruptly to scan for smoke/voices; during storms or after rumors
#       of raiders she has shaking breath and cannot eat.
#     timing: Emerges in adolescence (ages 12–17), becomes pronounced during raids and
#       child illnesses (ages 19–41).
#     trait: Neuroticism (very high) / Anxiety disorder
#   - consequence: Gains short-term security and influence but builds mistrust with
#       co-wives/affines, contributing to later domestic conflict.
#     scene: She manipulates allocation meetings by flattering elders, exaggerating
#       her household’s need, and quietly shifting food between pits; when confronted,
#       she calmly blames animals, spoilage, or a rival woman’s carelessness.
#     timing: Visible from late childhood within polygynous household competition (ages
#       8–17) and becomes a survival strategy after migration (ages 24–33).
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (very low)
#   - consequence: Others perceive her as difficult to rely on day-to-day; she compensates
#       by controlling key tasks (seed stores) where she can exert tight control.
#     scene: She is capable and intense in bursts (especially when anxious), but inconsistent
#       with routine tasks—forgetting agreed work rotations, misplacing tools, or letting
#       minor repairs slide until a crisis.
#     timing: Most visible in mid-adulthood when illness begins and workload is heavy
#       (ages 28–41).
#     trait: Conscientiousness (low)
#   - consequence: Helps her maintain moderately high standing despite mistrust; allows
#       her to be consulted while still provoking private resentment.
#     scene: In public she presents as conciliatory—soothing disputes, offering small
#       gifts, speaking gently—while privately bargaining hard and keeping score.
#     timing: Young adulthood onward (ages 18–41), especially during her recognition
#       as a garden manager.
#     trait: Agreeableness (moderately high) coexisting with low Honesty-Humility
# number_of_children: 10+
# number_of_siblings: '5'
# occupation: Horticulture/garden tending (planting, weeding, harvest; often combined
#   with childcare)
# religion: Ancestor-focused practices (caring for the dead, small offerings at burial
#   places/kept remains, invoking ancestors for protection)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: 'Recurring pattern: during lean seasons she quietly diverted garden produce
#     and stored dried roots/maize-like grains from a co-wife’s or affinal kinswoman’s
#     store-pit, and occasionally claimed it had been spoiled or taken by animals when
#     questioned.'
#   reasoning: Opportunistic taking and boundary-violations (stealing food, tools, garden
#     produce) likely happened sometimes; very low honesty-humility increases this risk
#     despite social sanctions.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Ages 24–33 (after migration, while raising several small children)
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime
# - event: 'Sustained period: she became known for managing productive mixed gardens
#     on new, marginal plots near the foothill edge—organizing weeding/harvest labor
#     and seed-saving so reliably that her household could host visitors and contribute
#     to exchanges in years when others were short.'
#   reasoning: In non-literate small communities, “achievement” usually means reputation
#     for horticultural skill, mediation, ritual competence, or alliance-building; her
#     moderately high standing implies some recognized success, but truly notable renown
#     is less common.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Ages 29–38
#   type: major_achievement
# - event: 'Recurring pattern: in her repartnered household, arguments over food allocation
#     and accusations of infidelity escalated into beatings (slaps, strikes with a stick,
#     hair-pulling), sometimes requiring her to stay with nearby kin to heal and calm
#     the dispute.'
#   reasoning: Polygynous and later repartnered households raise jealousy/conflict and
#     male control; with very high neuroticism, repeated partner conflict is plausible,
#     making intimate-partner violence a common subtype.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Ages 35–41
#   type: domestic_violence
# - event: 'Single event: she fell while carrying a heavy load of harvested tubers/wood
#     down a steep, slick path after rain, injuring her hip/leg badly enough that she
#     could not walk normally or work fields for many weeks and had to be fed and helped
#     by kin.'
#   reasoning: Daily horticultural labor (cutting, carrying, fire, steep terrain) makes
#     a nonfatal but serious injury likely over 41 years, and it fits with her ultimate
#     death by accident suggesting a risky environment.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 31–32
#   type: serious_accident
# - event: 'Sustained period: after multiple pregnancies and repeated bouts of fever
#     and diarrhea in the wet seasons, she developed long-lasting weakness with recurring
#     abdominal pain and fatigue consistent with heavy паразitic burden/anemia, limiting
#     how long she could work without resting.'
#   reasoning: Endemic parasites, recurrent infections, anemia, and chronic pain conditions
#     were common; high parity further increases long-term pelvic/back problems and
#     weakness.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Ages 28–41
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: 'Sustained period: her community repeatedly evacuated gardens and sleeping
#     shelters after warning signs of a raid/feud—hiding in forested ravines and returning
#     later to find some stores looted and parts of the settlement burned or cut down.'
#   reasoning: Most “warfare impact” for an adult woman would be raids/feuds causing
#     flight, temporary displacement, loss of kin, or living under threat; her long-distance
#     migration raises this likelihood.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Ages 19–23 (around the time of her long-distance move)
#   type: civilian_war_exposure
# - event: 'Single event: during a surprise dawn attack, she saw attackers kill a fleeing
#     man with clubs/spears at close range and then cut and carry off valuables/food,
#     leaving the body where it fell as her group fled into cover.'
#   reasoning: Raids can involve killings witnessed at close range, but not everyone
#     directly sees deaths; still plausible given exposure and the small-community scale
#     where events are personal.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 21
#   type: witnessed_atrocity
---

Sola was born into a small community of gardens and forest-edge foraging in the foothills east of the high Andes. No chiefs issued orders beyond what kin enforced; decisions came from household heads and elders who could gather followers and settle disputes with gifts, threats, and marriage ties. Her people spoke a local tongue that outsiders could not understand, and they kept close relations with the dead. Graves near old house sites were tended, and small offerings of food and red-stained water were left for named ancestors whose help was asked in sickness and fear.

She arrived first among six daughters. Her mother Wira carried her on her hip while tending hearth and stores; her father Teka moved between hearths, with more than one partner, and his reputation came from arranging exchanges and gathering men for defense. Sira, an elder from Wira’s side, showed Sola how to place a pinch of roasted grain and a smear of fat on a stone beside a grave. When Sira died while Sola was still small, Wira led her to the burial place with a bundle of herbs and a gourd of water, and Sola watched the careful placement of offerings before anyone spoke of other matters.

Two infant sisters died when Sola was still a child. The crying and the quick, tight work of women folding tiny limbs into a wrap stayed with her. After that, she kept counting: gourds, digging sticks, baskets, the days until rain. She began waking before the others, walking out to the store-pits to press her palm to the packed earth lids and listen for movement. If she heard nothing, she still dug at the edge to make sure the covering had not cracked.

Mina, two years behind her, became her shadow. They carried firewood together and shared roasted tubers when Wira’s back was turned. Tami, born after Mina, took tasks without complaint; she waited for instructions and finished them. Rina, the fourth, was a bright child who ran fast and talked too much. When Sola was twelve, smoke from burning grasslands drifted through camp for days, and adults argued about whether to shift sleeping places. Sola did not wait for the decision. She moved a basket of dried roots and a small pouch of seed to a hollow under a fallen tree and covered it with leaves.

By the time she bled for the first time, she knew how to keep a garden alive on thin soil: plant tall stalks where water held, place tubers where shade kept the ground cool, keep seed from the best plants separate. She also learned how adults watched each other’s stores. In her father’s household, Paya, another wife of Teka, guarded her own pits and accused Wira’s children of taking. Sola answered with a soft voice and a steady face, and then took what she wanted when no one watched. She learned which stories worked: a torn lid, a burrowing animal, a child who must have wandered.

At nineteen, threats along the trails stopped being talk. Men came back from hunting with stories of strangers near the streams. Teka met visitors with gifts, then kept watch at night. Sola’s household joined a marriage exchange with a group farther away, and she left the foothill forests for a different stretch of river and garden land. The move took days. She carried a digging stick, a net bag with seed wrapped in leaves, and a child’s blanket Wira had woven from plant fibers.

Her new community built sleeping shelters that could be abandoned quickly. On the first dry season there, word of a raid traveled fast. The settlement emptied before dawn, families dropping into ravines and staying under trees until the sun was high. Sola learned to keep quiet children close and to move in a line without talking. At twenty-one, attackers came at first light. She ran with the others and turned back once, just once, at the sound of shouting. A man stumbled in the open and fell under blows of clubs and a thrusting spear. She saw him stop moving. She did not go near him. She pushed her face into her child’s hair and kept moving until she reached cover.

Her partner Kali stayed close during those years and listened to elders. He was not gentle, but he brought meat and helped rebuild when shelters were cut down. Sola bore her first son, Oka, at twenty. She had Yani two years later, then Kora, then a daughter, Luma. She stored seed in small packets and buried them deeper than others did. When her children slept, she lay awake with her hand on the edge of the hearth, listening for sounds beyond the circle of light.

Rina died back in her birth community when Sola was twenty-three. The news came with visiting kin who brought a small gift of stone flakes. They described the burial place, and Sola asked for details that others did not care about: which side of the path, whether a stone was set at the head, what food had been left. That night she put roasted roots and a strip of dried meat on a flat stone outside her shelter and whispered Rina’s name.

Lean seasons made her sharp. At twenty-four, when stores ran low after uneven rains, she began taking from pits that were not hers. Sani, a kinswoman by marriage in Kali’s household, kept dried roots and grain in a covered hole near her sleeping place. Sola waited until others were away and lifted the lid, sliding a portion into her own bag. When questioned later about missing food, she pointed to the disturbed earth and said she had seen rodent tracks. Her voice stayed calm.

She birthed Ima at twenty-eight. That wet season brought fever and diarrhea through the settlement. Sola survived but never regained her old strength. She rose with a tight, anxious energy and worked hard for a while, then had to sit down and grip her belly until the wave passed. She continued to bear children. A girl, also called Sola by others despite her mother’s reluctance, died the day she was born. Sola did not argue with the naming; she only tightened her jaw and asked Yura, a ritual worker, to pour water mixed with red pigment onto the packed earth by the infant’s burial.

Despite illness, she made gardens thrive where others failed. At twenty-nine she chose a marginal plot near the foothill edge, where fog drifted in some mornings and the soil was thin. She timed planting to the first steady rains and kept weeding strict, pushing children and younger women into lines. She saved seed from plants that withstood dry weeks and kept it wrapped and hung from roof poles to avoid damp. Her household hosted visitors during a good harvest, feeding them stewed tubers and roasted small game. She sat close to the fire, watched who took the biggest portions, and laughed once when Luma teased Yani for dropping a gourd and splashing ash water onto his legs.

At thirty-one, returning from the plot after rain, she carried a heavy load of tubers and wood down a slick path. Her foot slid. She fell hard and struck her hip and leg. For weeks she could not walk without help. Yani brought her food; Luma sat beside her and picked parasites from the children’s hair. The injury healed, but she limped after that, and exhaustion came quicker.

Kali died when Sola was thirty-four. The household did not split neatly; alliances shifted. She endured one more infant death, Ala-2, the same year Kali was buried. Within two years she entered a new union with Tuna. He already had children and an adult sister who watched Sola closely. Sola’s standing remained solid—she had surviving children and a record of full store-pits—but in that blended household every allocation became a fight.

From thirty-five onward, Tuna hit her during disputes. He accused her of favoring her own children, of hiding food, of talking too long with other men. One night, after Sira-2 died at birth, he blamed her and struck her with a stick until her arms and back were striped. She left before dawn and stayed three days with a nearby kin group, tending a small grave with a pinch of roasted grain and a dab of fat, her hands shaking as she pressed the offering into the soil.

She kept working her plots through pain and fatigue. She enjoyed the hour after sunrise when fog still clung to leaves and the paths were quiet. She liked a thick stew made from tubers cooked long, with crushed seeds added at the end. She avoided long arguments with elders; she saved her words for bargaining at the store-pits, where she could point to what was visible and insist.

At forty-one, during the wet season, she went out with a load strapped across her shoulders. The ground was slick again. On a steep bank above a stream, she slipped and fell, striking her head on stone. Her kin wrapped her and carried her back. They placed her in the earth near the settlement’s burial place with a small packet of seed and a gourd of water stained red, set beside her for the ancestors to accept.
