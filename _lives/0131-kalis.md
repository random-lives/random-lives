# narrative_plan:
#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: -367
#     name: Armas
#     narrative_role: Father of the household line; dies when Kalis is about 8, triggering
#       the shift to a grandfather/uncle-headed joint household. Remembered by Kalis
#       as steady and quiet; his absence sets the stage for harsher discipline.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Brenis
#     narrative_role: Primary nurturer and household producer; protective but constrained
#       by the authority of her father-in-law/brother-in-law. Relationship with Kalis
#       is warm but practical; she relies on him for labor as he grows.
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: -357
#     name: Papas
#     narrative_role: Household head after the father's death; stern, traditional, and
#       status-conscious about being 'free smallholders.' Becomes the sick relative
#       Kalis cares for; relationship is demanding but not wholly cruel (approval is
#       rare and powerful).
#     role: paternal grandfather
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Gordas
#     narrative_role: 'Controls day-to-day work assignments and discipline; main source
#       of childhood beatings and later pressures Kalis into temporary work/service.
#       Relationship: fear, resignation, occasional brief pride when Kalis performs
#       reliably.'
#     role: paternal uncle (father's brother) / acting household manager
#   children: []
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 7
#     connection: Begins soon after father’s death when the uncle becomes the day-to-day
#       enforcer; Kalis’s low openness and low reactivity lead him to comply quietly
#       rather than argue, which paradoxically can trigger more 'tests' of obedience.
#     incident: childhood_abuse
#   - age: 8
#     connection: Intensifies during the first full year without his father; punishments
#       tied to herding mistakes, spilled grain, or being perceived as slow.
#     incident: childhood_abuse
#   - age: 9
#     connection: Reinforced by labor pressure and family grief over earlier infant
#       losses; food-withholding used when stores run low.
#     incident: childhood_abuse
#   - age: 10
#     connection: Coincides with rising regional insecurity and adult anxiety; the household
#       becomes stricter about boys staying close and following orders.
#     incident: childhood_abuse
#   - age: 11
#     connection: Tapers as he becomes physically more useful and less 'correctable'
#       as a child; discipline shifts toward work expectations rather than beatings.
#     incident: childhood_abuse
#   - age: 16
#     connection: Grandfather becomes debilitated; Kalis’s role expands to lifting,
#       cleaning, fetching water/fuel, and night watch so other adults can keep fields/animals
#       going.
#     incident: sick_relative
#   - age: 17
#     connection: Caregiving continues through harvest; Kalis misses some peer social
#       life and becomes known as reliable, 'steady-handed' in the village.
#     incident: sick_relative
#   - age: 18
#     connection: On a late-summer market return route, goat theft occurs at a crowded
#       spring stop; it prompts new household rules about tethering and who watches
#       loads.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 20
#     connection: During an away stint (harvest labor/guard duty), a nighttime quarrel
#       leads to a beating; afterward he is more cautious, avoids boasting, and is less
#       willing to sleep far from trusted kin.
#     incident: physical_assault
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6
#     key_events:
#     - Grows up in a patrilocal extended compound with grandfather as a visible authority
#       and mother constantly occupied with food and textiles.
#     - 'Learns early boundaries of acceptable behavior: obedience, silence during adult
#       talk, and ritual participation at the hearth and small outdoor shrines.'
#     - Exposure to periodic in-kind demands (grain/animals) linked to satrapal administration,
#       experienced as 'men arriving to count and take.'
#     phase: Infancy and early childhood
#   - age_range: 7-11
#     key_events:
#     - Father dies around age 8; household leadership consolidates under grandfather/uncle,
#       increasing workload on surviving boys.
#     - Regular herding errands and grain-processing tasks become Kalis’s routine; discipline
#       becomes harsh and punitive.
#     - First awareness of broader instability as travelers bring rumors and the adults
#       talk more about raids and road danger.
#     phase: Later childhood (after father’s death/absence)
#   - age_range: 12-17
#     key_events:
#     - 'Wider political transition reaches the district: news of Macedonian advance
#       and shifting authorities; requisitions and insecurity increase.'
#     - 'Learns adult male tasks: plowing/harvesting scheduling, guarding animals at
#       night, and traveling to market stops with older kin.'
#     - One full year of major caregiving for ill grandfather (winter through harvest),
#       forcing Kalis into a quasi-adult responsibility role.
#     phase: Adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-22
#     key_events:
#     - Begins taking longer trips for periodic market exchange and occasional seasonal
#       labor/service to bring back grain or cash-equivalent goods.
#     - Suffers a property loss (stolen goat) that tightens household margins and increases
#       suspicion and watch duties.
#     - Nighttime assault during an away stint leaves lingering pain and marks him as
#       someone who has 'seen rough men.'
#     - Final year includes heightened armed risk (local disputes/war conditions), culminating
#       in violent death at 22.
#     phase: Young adulthood
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Kydas
#     prominence: Ages 17-20; accompanies trips and provides a contrast (more talkative,
#       more willing to take risks).
#     relationship: Neighboring smallholder and occasional market companion (older than
#       Kalis by several years)
#   - name: Mokas
#     prominence: Ages 18-22; ties Kalis’s temporary service and exposure to violence
#       to wider insecurity.
#     relationship: Local herdsman/guard organizer who recruits young men for seasonal
#       watch/escort work
#   - name: Attis
#     prominence: Intermittent from childhood onward; appears around infant-remembrance
#       rites and during the grandfather’s illness.
#     relationship: Village elder/ritual specialist who leads seasonal offerings and
#       advises households on omens
#   - name: Denas
#     prominence: Age 18 (market/spring stop context); represents the limits of local
#       justice and reliance on kin pressure.
#     relationship: A known troublemaker from a nearby hamlet suspected of petty theft

#     name: Taras
#     narrative_role: Youngest brother; too young to share Kalis's early burdens, but
#       becomes the household's 'future' after Kalis dies; Kalis teaches him basic herding
#       and boundary routes.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: He doesn’t pursue learning Greek or new trades and stays tied to
#       kin-directed labor; this reduces mobility options and keeps him embedded in
#       local obligations and risks.
#     scene: He avoids unfamiliar rituals, foreign speech, and new farming tricks; when
#       others discuss Macedonian/Greek ways or new measures at market, he sticks to
#       the old routes, old weights, and what the elders say is proper.
#     timing: Most visible from adolescence into young adulthood (ages 12-22)
#     trait: Very low Openness (2nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Adults trust him with night watch and caregiving; peers sometimes
#       misread him as cold or unfeeling, which can isolate him socially.
#     scene: In tense moments—storms, raids rumors, a sick elder—he appears unusually
#       calm, speaks little, and continues tasks methodically, even when others panic
#       or complain.
#     timing: Especially during caregiving and later violence exposure (ages 16-22)
#     trait: Very low Neuroticism (2nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Elders assign him sensitive tasks (counting animals, carrying goods),
#       yet his unwillingness to retaliate or cheat can make him a target for bolder
#       men.
#     scene: He refuses to skim from shared stores, returns found items after market
#       days, and does not exaggerate his suffering after beatings or assault; he accepts
#       blame rather than shifting it onto younger children.
#     timing: Childhood through adulthood, but clearest after he gains responsibility
#       (ages 14-22)
#     trait: High Honesty-Humility (92nd percentile)
# number_of_children: '0'
# number_of_siblings: '9'
# occupation: General mixed farmer (grain + livestock) within the family holding (tree
#   crops secondary)
# religion: 'Household-and-village polytheism: hearth/ancestor offerings, small animal/food
#   libations, seasonal agricultural rites; occasional local sanctuary visits'

# structured_incidents:
# - event: While returning from a periodic market day with a small load of grain and
#     a goat, he found the goat stolen from its tether during a crowded stop near a
#     roadside spring; the household treated it as a known local thief’s work but had
#     little recourse beyond kin pressure.
#   reasoning: Smallholders faced persistent risk of livestock theft, crop pilfering,
#     and occasional robbery during travel to markets or while away on service, though
#     not everyone experienced a clear one-time ‘crime’ event.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 18 (late summer)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: In the years after his father became absent/died and the household was under
#     his grandfather/uncle, he was frequently beaten with a stick for perceived laziness
#     or mistakes in herding and food-processing chores, and sometimes went to bed without
#     a portion as punishment.
#   reasoning: In high-stress agrarian households with many births and high child mortality,
#     harsh physical discipline and neglect were not rare, but an extended kin household
#     also provided buffering and oversight.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 7–11
#   type: childhood_abuse
# - event: During a short stint away from home with other young men for harvest work/guard
#     duty, he was set upon in a nighttime quarrel—struck with a cudgel and kicked—leaving
#     him with a badly bruised rib and a cut scalp that took weeks to heal.
#   reasoning: His death was due to violence/war and he had temporary work/service travel,
#     making non-domestic physical attack or serious fighting highly likely at least
#     once.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 20 (early autumn)
#   type: physical_assault
# - event: He spent months helping care for an older male relative in the household—likely
#     his grandfather—after a debilitating illness left him weak and sometimes febrile,
#     carrying water and fuel, minding animals, and helping him to sit and relieve himself
#     while other adults worked the fields.
#   reasoning: A joint household headed by grandfather/uncle makes it plausible an elder
#     or adult kin was chronically ill/injured, and an able-bodied young man would be
#     heavily used for daily care and labor substitution.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 16–17 (one full year spanning winter through harvest season)
#   type: sick_relative
---

Kalis was born into an Anatolian-speaking farming household in the uplands south of the Sea of Marmara, where villages sat among oak and pine and the fields depended on winter rain. When he was small the district answered to the Persian king through satraps and local officials; men arrived with tablets and escorts to take grain and count animals. His family poured wine at the hearth for their dead and for the powers of the place, and they burned fat and barley on small stones set near the edge of the yard.

He entered a crowded compound. His oldest sister, Sata, was already a young woman who could carry a jar on her hip and keep younger children away from the cooking fire. There were empty places in the family’s talk: Nana and Dada, two baby girls who had not lived past their first days, and Kotas, a boy who died the same way. Those names surfaced at the hearth when his mother, Brenis, set out a pinch of flour or a sip of milk, pressed between her fingers and dropped onto the coals. Kalis grew up listening more than speaking. He watched his father, Armas, walk the boundary lines in spring and check the vines and trees his own father had planted. Two years after Kalis, Brenis bore Manis, a boy who lived. But the deaths continued: Batas in Kalis's fourth year, Tatis in his sixth, Zanis in his eighth. Each time the small bundle was carried out past the gardens, and Brenis added another name to her offerings at the coals. The youngest, Taras, was born when Kalis was ten, and he survived.

His father's death came in Kalis's eighth year. Armas went out with other men to look for a missing animal and did not come back. They brought his body on a door plank, face covered with a cloth. The funeral was quick and local: washing, oil on the skin, a wrapped bundle carried to the family plot beyond the last gardens, and food set down beside the mound. After that, the household tightened. Papas, Kalis’s paternal grandfather, sat at the center and spoke more, and Gordas, the father’s brother, took charge of the boys’ work.

From seven to eleven Kalis learned the shape of punishment. Gordas struck him with a stick for letting goats stray into a neighbor’s plot, for spilling grain during grinding, for standing too long at the water jar. Sometimes the punishment ended with a smaller portion at supper. Kalis did not shout back. He took the blows, wiped his face, and returned to the task. Sata sometimes stepped between them when the strike came too fast; she would say the boy had already learned and would do better tomorrow. Brenis kept her voice low and tried to smooth it over with extra work—baking more flatbread, mending a cloak, taking on a neighbor’s weaving to keep favors.

In his tenth year strangers' news reached even the uplands. Carters talked at the spring about satraps quarreling with the Great King and soldiers gathering in the lowland cities. Kalis listened without asking questions. When he carried grain to be measured he stared at the weights, tried to memorize them, and then handed them back without comment. He avoided the men who liked to test him with new words from the coast. At home he stayed close to the familiar: the same path to the pasture, the same corner of the yard where he sharpened a sickle, the same place near the hearth where he ate.

By twelve he worked as a young man. He could guide the oxen in a straight line, though he did not have the quick eye for stones and roots that older men had. He was better with animals than with counting. He could tell which ewe had gone light in the flank, which goat had a sore hoof, and he remembered faces. When Brenis sent him with milk or a loaf to a neighbor he returned with the bowl intact. When he found a lost knife in a furrow he carried it back and laid it in Gordas’s palm without trying to keep it.

The unrest did not arrive as a proclamation. It came as soldiers. When Kalis was eleven and then twelve, armed men passed through the district more often—royal troops, garrison contingents, bands whose allegiance changed with the season. The village had to provide fodder, bread, and guidance on the tracks. Papas grumbled about the demands, which came regardless of who held power in the lowland cities. The roads grew less safe. Young men took turns watching the herds at night, sitting with a sling and stones in a pouch, listening for dogs.

At sixteen Papas fell ill in winter. He shivered by the hearth even when the fire was strong, then lay for days with a dull stare and a weakness that did not lift. That winter and the following seasons, Kalis took on the tasks that could be done close to the house so Brenis and Gordas could keep the fields going. He hauled water in a skin, split kindling, and carried dung to the garden beds. He helped the old man sit up and drink thin barley broth. When Papas had to relieve himself, Kalis held him under the arms and steadied him so he would not fall, then cleaned the mat and rinsed rags at the edge of the stream. At night he slept light, waking when the old man called out. He did not complain. He spoke to Papas in short answers and waited for instructions that rarely came. Once, during the spring sowing, Papas gripped his wrist and nodded at the straight rows outside, and Kalis kept that as approval. Papas died in Kalis's eighteenth year, still feeble, unable to sit up at the end.

Sata married when Kalis was seventeen and moved to another village. She brought bread and dried fruit on her last visit, teasing him that he ate too quickly and did not leave the best pieces for the elders. Kalis smiled once and went back to cutting fodder. After she left, the compound felt louder and harsher. Manis was now old enough to argue with Gordas, and their quarrels filled the yard. Kalis stayed out of them, taking the goats up the slope where the shrubs were thick and the ground smelled of resin in the heat.

Late in the summer when he was eighteen, Kalis went to a periodic market with a small sack of grain and a goat. On the return he stopped at a roadside spring where other travelers watered animals and filled jars. He tethered the goat and set down the grain. When he turned back, the tether lay on the ground and the goat was gone. He looked through the crowd, then along the track, scanning faces, not calling out. Kydas, an older neighbor traveling with him, swore and pushed between men, but the animal did not reappear. Back home, Gordas called it carelessness. Kalis accepted the rebuke and then spent extra nights watching the remaining animals, sitting with his sling and a small knife, eyes open, mouth shut.

At twenty Kalis left the village for early autumn work, joining other young men hired to help bring in a larger harvest and to stand watch on the road where theft had grown common. Mokas, who organized escorts and guards, put them in a rough shelter with reed mats and a small fire pit. One night after drinking thin wine, a quarrel broke out over a ration and an insult. Kalis did not throw the first words. He tried to move away, but a man struck him with a cudgel. Boots hit his ribs when he fell. He returned home days later with a cut scalp crusted with dried blood and a bruise that made him breathe shallow for weeks. Brenis washed the wound with warm water and salt and set a cloth on it. Gordas asked no questions beyond whether the work was finished.

The last years were marked by more armed men on the tracks and more talk of satrapal disputes and unpaid garrisons turning to plunder. Kalis kept to his routine: early rising, a mouthful of bread, then animals or field. He took satisfaction in small things—fresh cheese still warm from pressing, the quiet of midday under a tree when the goats chewed and stopped moving, the sound of grain pouring into a jar without stones mixed in. He laughed rarely, but he laughed once when Taras, the youngest brother, tried to imitate a man’s deep voice and cracked into a high squeal; Kalis covered his mouth with his hand and looked away so Gordas would not see.

He died at twenty-two in late autumn. He had gone with a few men to escort animals and a load of produce along a track where raiders had been reported. Near a narrow place between scrub and stones, armed men rushed them. Kalis took a blow and went down. The survivors carried what they could back toward the village, leaving the rest scattered on the path.

His family recovered his body before night. They washed him at the edge of the yard, wrapped him, and laid him in the family ground with a cup of wine poured onto the earth and a small piece of bread set by his head.

CHANGELOG:
- Fixed major anachronism: The original narrative referenced Macedonians and Alexander the Great's invasion, but Kalis lived 376-354 BC while Alexander invaded Anatolia in 334 BC (20 years after Kalis died). Replaced all Macedonian references with period-appropriate Persian/Achaemenid context:
  - "Macedonians across the water and Greek cities shifting sides" → "satraps quarreling with the Great King and soldiers gathering in the lowland cities"
  - "The change of rulers did not arrive as a proclamation" → "The unrest did not arrive as a proclamation" with reference to "royal troops, garrison contingents, bands whose allegiance changed with the season"
  - "more talk of who controlled which town" → "more talk of satrapal disputes and unpaid garrisons turning to plunder"
- No other issues found: household structure clear, all siblings accounted for, all incidents covered, trait manifestations visible, no AI-slop phrases
