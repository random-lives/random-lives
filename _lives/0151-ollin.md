#       while also recalling his hunger years.
#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 5
#     connection: After repeated seizures and clumsy task failures, the overburdened
#       caretaking adults (especially aunt/uncle) escalate beatings and neglect; coincides
#       with grief from infant sibling deaths and household stress.
#     incident: childhood_abuse
#   - age: 8
#     connection: During a year with poor harvest/frost damage, food is rationed; adults
#       prioritize stronger children and punish him for wasting maize or working slowly.
#     incident: childhood_abuse
#   - age: 37
#     connection: As shortages tighten and market exchange worsens, he begins crossing
#       into a neighboring community’s claimed woodland for extra fuelwood, justifying
#       it as necessity while knowing it risks dispute.
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   - age: 39
#     connection: 'Pattern continues: repeated illicit cutting/charcoal burning to trade
#       for maize; tied directly to the household’s failing stores and his reduced bargaining
#       power after separation.'
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   - age: 38
#     connection: Crop failure and depleted stores force him to trade away cloth/tools

#     death_year: 1198
#     name: Tochtli
#     narrative_role: Youngest sibling (brother); his loss closes his mother’s childbearing
#       years and leaves Ollin without age-peers at home, pushing him toward adult work
#       early.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Limits mobility and adaptation during shortages; makes him dependable
#       but constrains his ability to pivot occupations or negotiate complex deals.
#     scene: He resists new methods (different charcoal pit design, unfamiliar crops,
#       new trading arrangements) and repeats what he was taught, insisting 'the old
#       way' is safest.
#     timing: Most visible in adolescence and adulthood (ages ~12-40)
#     trait: Very low openness (5th percentile)
#   - consequence: Builds a reputation as a trusted wood/charcoal trader; also makes
#       it psychologically hard for him when he later trespasses for wood during famine.
#     scene: In market exchanges he measures fairly, returns an overpayment, and refuses
#       to claim more maize than he carried; he is embarrassed by praise and avoids
#       boasting.
#     timing: Young and mature adulthood (ages ~18-37)
#     trait: Very high honesty-humility (100th percentile)
#   - consequence: Increases vulnerability to exploitation and harsh discipline; contributes
#       to marital strain and to dependence on kin for decisions during crisis.
#     scene: He struggles with multi-step planning (keeping track of debts, timing market
#       days, calculating exchanges), needs simple repeated instructions, and is easily
#       confused by disputes or fast speech.
#     timing: Childhood onward; emphasized during adulthood negotiations (ages ~7-40)
#     trait: Very low intelligence / Borderline intellectual functioning
#   - consequence: Triggers childhood punishment/neglect, constrains travel and warfare
#       participation, and contributes to separation and later reliance on kin households.
#     scene: Unpredictable seizures occur during chores (dropping loads, collapsing
#       near fires); afterward he is exhausted and treated with a mix of fear, ritual
#       caution, and irritation.
#     timing: Across life; especially disruptive in childhood and working years (ages
#       ~3-40)
#     trait: Congenital epilepsy
#   - consequence: Reduces social buffer during marital conflict and makes reconciliation
#       harder; contributes to separation even though he is not habitually cruel.
#     scene: He speaks little in group settings, avoids joking, and can be blunt or
#       stubborn when pressed, leading to simmering conflicts rather than open social
#       bonding.
#     timing: Most visible in marriage years and post-separation disputes (ages ~20-35)
#     trait: Low extraversion (28th percentile) and low agreeableness (31st percentile)
# number_of_children: '2'
# number_of_siblings: '3'
# occupation: Mixed farmer + woodland resource work (fuelwood/charcoal/timber gathering)
#   as major component
# religion: Household altar offerings (copal incense, food, drink), prayers to common
#   Nahua deities/forces; participation in village calendrical festivals at local shrine/temple

# - 0
# - 0
# sibling_sexes:
# - F
# - F
# - M
# structured_incidents:
# - event: During a period of shortage he repeatedly cut and carried fuelwood from a
#     neighboring community’s claimed woodland without permission, selling part of it
#     as charcoal and keeping the rest for cooking, despite knowing it violated local
#     norms and could trigger a dispute.
#   reasoning: Opportunistic petty theft/illicit taking of resources (especially wood)
#     could occur, but his reputation as a respected, reliable commoner and extremely
#     high honesty-humility push this down.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Ages 37–39 (late 1220s to early 1230s); recurring pattern
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime
# - event: After poor rains and crop shortfalls, his household’s stored maize ran out;
#     he pawned or traded away tools and cloth, relied heavily on kin in the extended-family
#     compound, and spent much of the year doing extra woodcutting/charcoal work just
#     to obtain food, with episodes of hunger and weight loss.
#   reasoning: He died in a food-shortage/famine context, and as a separated man living
#     in an extended-kin household (not head), he was at real risk of becoming dependent
#     or losing access to adequate resources.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Ages 38–40 (circa 1230–1232); sustained period
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: As a small child he was frequently beaten and harshly disciplined by an overburdened
#     caregiver in his mother’s kin household—especially after seizure episodes or when
#     he failed at tasks—along with periods of severe neglect when food was scarce and
#     adults prioritized other children.
#   reasoning: He was raised in a single-mother, kin-supported household; severe abuse
#     is not implied, but physical punishment and harsh treatment were common, and his
#     epilepsy/low cognitive functioning could increase caregiver frustration and neglect
#     risk.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Ages 5–10 (circa 1197–1202); recurring pattern
#   type: childhood_abuse

Ollin was born on February 3, 1192, in the upland forests and fields north of the great lakes of the Basin of Mexico. The place answered to shifting city-states, each with its own rulers and demands; village life turned on tribute, labor service, and the calendar of rites. His people spoke Nahuatl in the household and used Otomí with neighbors and traders who passed through the wooded ridges. At dawn his mother, Chalchiuh, burned a pinch of copal on a clay brazier and set out a small bit of tortilla and beans for the household powers and for Tlaloc, because the harvest depended on the rains.

His father, Yaotl, was already dead. Chalchiuh lived in her mother’s compound, where her brother Coatl held the tools and made decisions about fields and woodlots. Ollin learned early what it meant to be watched by relatives. When the women ground maize on the metate, he carried water from a spring and brought kindling from the edge of the pines.

The seizures began before he could remember them as separate from the days. He would be sorting beans or holding a bundle of sticks, then drop and jerk and bite his tongue. Afterward he sat dull-eyed, ashamed, and did what he was told to do. Some adults treated the fits as something dangerous that could spread; others treated them as a nuisance that wasted food and time. When he was two, a sister was born—Xochitl—and died before she took a full season of breath. Another baby girl, Citlalli, lived only long enough to be wrapped and carried away. In 1198 a brother, Tochtli, came and went the same way. Each death weighed on the compound. Adults spoke less gently. The household had fewer hands and more fear.

At five, Ollin could carry small loads and should have been able to keep track of simple tasks. He did not. He forgot where he set down a stone adze. He mixed up the jars of beans and amaranth. He stared when spoken to quickly, especially in Otomí, and answered late, which irritated Coatl. The beatings started as quick slaps, then turned into blows with a flat stick or the edge of a woven strap. Mazatl, an aunt who managed the cooking and chores, hit him when he spilled water or dropped a pot, and she left him without food when he was slow. After a seizure, when he woke sore and confused, she made him stand in the yard while others ate. He learned to keep his face blank and his hands close.

Coatl took him once to Mixtli, a curer who read day-signs and listened to the way a child breathed. Mixtli burned copal and passed smoke over Ollin’s head and chest, then rubbed him with herbs and spoke over a bowl of water. The fits returned anyway. The ritual did not end the punishments. It only gave the adults a reason to say the child needed strictness.

In 1207, his grandmother Iztac died. She had been the one who held food for him when the others passed him over, who spoke to him slowly and repeated herself without anger. After her death, no one in the compound spoke to him gently. Coatl's authority became more direct.

He grew tall. By fifteen his shoulders were broad enough for heavier burdens, and his work steadied when tasks were simple and repeated. Acatl, an older cousin skilled in woodland work, taught him to stack fuelwood so it dried clean and to dig the shallow pit for charcoal, then cover the burning wood with earth and watch the smoke. Ollin copied exactly what he was shown. When someone suggested a different venting pattern or a faster way to bundle sticks, he refused. He repeated the old method even when it cost time. Acatl called him “stone-headed” once, not kindly, but he also handed him food when the others forgot.

Ollin avoided the drinking feasts that drew young men into boasting and fights. He did not sing loudly. He sat near the edge of gatherings and watched the dancers’ feet, not their faces. He liked the first heat of morning and the taste of roasted squash seeds when there were some to spare. He kept a small habit: before leaving for the woods, he touched the corner of the household hearth and muttered a short prayer to the fire, careful and quiet.

In 1212 he entered a recognized union with a young woman also named Xochitl, from a nearby settlement. Her relatives spoke Nahuatl and enough Otomí to bargain without confusion. They built their sleeping space within the larger compound. Xochitl expected a husband who could plan, count, and argue for better terms at exchange. Ollin brought wood and worked without complaint, but he could not follow quick bargaining. When a trader offered him salt and obsidian blades for charcoal, Ollin accepted the first offer and returned home with less than he should have. He did not lie about it. He laid everything out on a mat and said what happened. Xochitl scolded him until he went rigid and silent.

Their son, Cuauhtli, was born in 1214. A daughter, Xochitl, followed in 1217. Ollin handled infants awkwardly at first, holding them too stiffly, but he learned the routines. He carried the children on his back when Xochitl worked the grinding stone. He cut small toys from wood scraps, simple shapes, the same ones each time. When the children were older, he taught them to pick up fallen sticks and sort them by thickness, and he praised them for doing it the right way.

Conflict grew as the years tightened. Seizures came without warning. Once, after a fit near the cooking fire, he knocked over a pot and wasted broth. Xochitl struck him with a spoon and then with her open hand. He grabbed her wrist and shoved her away too hard. That winter she moved to her family's side of the compound for several weeks, returning only when Coatl pushed for order. The dispute never cleared. Ollin’s bluntness made arguments worse; he did not soften his words or explain himself well. He also refused to take new work farther away, even when Xochitl said they needed the exchange.

Chalchiuh died in 1220. Her loss changed the compound’s balance. Ollin still did his share, but without his mother’s presence he had less say in where his labor went. Coatl became sharper in his demands, and Mazatl controlled the food stores more strictly. In 1224, after another quarrel over exchange goods and after Ollin failed to show up on the day Xochitl's family expected him to help with planting, Xochitl ended the union and kept the children close to her relatives. Ollin did not fight for them with words or gifts he did not have. He returned to the maternal compound and slept near the tools, where Coatl could see him.

Through his thirties, he earned a steady place by doing what others avoided: long days in the pine-oak slopes, carrying heavy bundles, tending slow charcoal burns through the night. He kept his measures fair at exchange. Once, Tecpatl, a middleman at a periodic market, overpaid him in maize for a sack of charcoal. Ollin counted out kernels with his fingers, frowned, and pushed a portion back. Tecpatl laughed and called him a fool. Ollin did not smile, but he did not take the extra.

Coatl died in 1228. Ollin carried wood for the funeral fire and stood silent while his uncle's body was wrapped and burned with offerings. Without Coatl, decisions about the fields and woodlots passed to Mazatl and a younger man in the compound.

The rains failed badly in 1229 and again the next year. Frost came early on the higher plots. By 1230 the maize jars sat low. Prices at exchange shifted. Tecpatl demanded more charcoal for the same amount of grain. The household began trading away cloth, then tools. Everyone ate less. Ollin spent longer days cutting and hauling. He stopped sharing roasted seeds with children in the compound. He ate quickly and looked away while others scraped bowls.

In 1229 he began crossing into a neighboring community’s claimed woodland to cut straighter, thicker trees. He knew the boundary markers. He passed them anyway, moving fast and keeping his eyes down. He did it again and again through 1231, burning charcoal in hidden pits and carrying it back at dawn. Chimal, an elder who watched the boundary, confronted him once on a path. Ollin answered in Otomí to show he understood the claim, then said, flatly, that his household had no maize. Chimal raised a stick and threatened to call men. Ollin did not fight. He backed away with his bundle and returned the next day by a different route.

By 1232 Ollin’s cheeks were hollow and his hands trembled from hunger when he tied bundles. On December 5 he collapsed in the compound after bringing in a small load, too weak to stand again.
