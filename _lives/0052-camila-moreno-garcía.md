Camila Moreno García was born on January 15, 2021, in Frontera, Coahuila. Karina Moreno signed the hospital papers alone. No one wrote a father’s name in front of her. When Camila asked later, Karina answered, “No está,” and did not explain.

They lived in a small apartment near a busy street. Trucks and buses passed early and late, and the heat pushed into the rooms for months at a time. Karina worked at a maquiladora, on her feet at a packing line with a hairnet and gloves. In 2021 and 2022 the factory added rules, then changed them again—masks, temperature checks at the entrance, workers sent home without pay when they tested positive. Karina went anyway. If she missed a shift, the pantry went thin.

Camila spent long days with a neighbor who watched several kids at once. When Alma, her older sister, came home from primary school, she took over. Alma did homework at the table and kept one eye on Camila, who pulled at drawers and cabinet doors until something gave.

Camila stayed quiet but acted on what she wanted. She dragged a chair across the floor to reach the top shelf. She took apart pens, snapped cheap plastic clips in half, and lined the pieces up to see how they matched. A plastic bottle became a shaker. A torn magazine became something she turned page by page, studying pictures until the paper softened at the corners.

She also left messes and walked away from them. Shoes disappeared under the bed and stayed there for days. Worksheets came home folded into tight squares, then ended up in the wrong notebook or in the trash by mistake. When Karina asked her to put things back, Camila stared past her and kept doing what she was doing. When Alma tried to correct her, Camila yanked her arm free and shut a door hard enough to rattle the frame.

Karina’s patience ran out after night shifts. She found half-finished drawings shoved behind the mattress and spilled bottle caps scattered in the corner and snapped at Camila in a flat, cutting voice. Camila didn’t cry. She waited until Karina left the room and went back to whatever she had been sorting.

Religion sat in the apartment like another rule. An image of the Virgen de Guadalupe was taped above a shelf. Karina lit a candle on payday and when a fever wouldn’t break. They went to Mass on Christmas Eve when Karina’s aunt insisted. Afterward they ate tamales from a foam container on the walk home.

By 2029 Camila walked to school with Alma, gripping one backpack strap and letting Alma steer her through traffic. At home she sat on the floor and sorted bottle caps by color, then by size, then by the dents on their edges. Karina reheated beans, listened for the gate outside, and checked the time because the next shift decided what the week would feel like.
