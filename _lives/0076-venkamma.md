#     name: Chenna
#     narrative_role: Youngest brother who died in infancy; contributes to Venkamma’s
#       sense that mothers and babies can be lost without warning.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Earns a reputation as 'dependable hands' so she gets hired more often,
#       but she overworks even when feverish, worsening exhaustion and illness.
#     scene: She rises before dawn to sweep the yard, pack gruel, and arrive early to
#       be chosen for day-work; she keeps careful mental track of grain measures and
#       repays small debts promptly when able.
#     timing: visible from ages 7-31; especially after widowhood (26-31)
#     trait: Very high conscientiousness (94th percentile)
#   - consequence: Smaller support network; less ability to negotiate wages or seek
#       distant opportunities, increasing vulnerability after widowhood.
#     scene: At festivals she stays near the women she knows, speaks little, and avoids
#       public disputes; she prefers solitary tasks like winnowing or weeding rows rather
#       than bargaining in the market.
#     timing: adolescence onward (10-31)
#     trait: Low extraversion (22nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Chronic worry compounds fatigue; increases likelihood of depressive
#       spirals during illness or scarcity.
#     scene: During the rains she becomes vigilant and fearful—listening for coughs,
#       checking children’s foreheads, interpreting small symptoms as omens; sleepless
#       nights follow.
#     timing: ages 16-31; peaks after child deaths and husband’s death
#     trait: High neuroticism (73rd percentile)
#   - consequence: More easily exploited in wage terms or debt arrangements; reinforces
#       dependence on kin/neighbors and her own rigid routines.
#     scene: She struggles with unfamiliar counting beyond simple measures and is easily
#       confused by messenger-talk about dues or changing officials; she relies on others
#       for anything involving records or complex bargaining.
#     timing: notable in adolescence and adulthood (12-31)
#     trait: Low intelligence (15th percentile)
#   - consequence: Creates tension with a field overseer and a neighbor, but not a major
#       scandal; it shows survival pragmatism rather than criminality.
#     scene: When grain runs short, she is willing to take a little extra gleaning at
#       the field edge or conceal a handful of husked rice before measures are checked,
#       justifying it as survival for children.
#     timing: mostly after widowhood (26-31)
#     trait: Moderately low honesty-humility (35th percentile)
#   - consequence: Reduced ability to seek help and to maintain household resilience;
#       contributes to vulnerability during the final respiratory illness.
#     scene: After the death of her small daughter and later after widowhood, she has
#       stretches of days with slowed movement, neglect of self-care, frequent tears,
#       and a sense of heaviness; she still works when forced, but with diminished speech
#       and appetite.
#     timing: first clear episode ages 25-26; recurrent/worsening ages 28-31
#     trait: Depressive disorder (must be visible)
#   - consequence: Limits earning options and increases social vulnerability; reinforces
#       her quiet, compliant public posture.
#     scene: In the fields she is assigned lower-paid tasks like weeding and gathering
#       rather than heavy lifting; people comment on her size in marriage negotiations
#       and later treat her as easier to push aside in hiring lines.
#     timing: adolescence through adulthood (12-31)
#     trait: Very short stature (5th percentile)
# number_of_children: '5'
# number_of_siblings: '5'
# occupation: Wage day-laborer in agriculture (working others’ fields more than own
#   household’s land), especially after widowhood
# religion: Household pūjā + village goddess (grama devata) worship + participation
#   in local temple festivals

# structured_incidents:
# - event: While doing harvest day-labor, she slipped on wet field bunds and cut her
#     lower leg badly with a sickle; the wound became inflamed and she could not walk
#     to the fields or carry water for several weeks, relying on neighbors/kin for help.
#   reasoning: Agricultural day-labor involved sickles, carrying water/fuel, working
#     with animals, and walking long distances; serious sprains/fractures or deep cuts
#     were plausible, but less frequent than disease-driven morbidity.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 23–24 (one acute event with weeks-long incapacity)
#   type: serious_accident
# - event: She suffered recurring bouts of fever and chills that left her weak for days
#     at a time—especially after the rains—making it hard to keep up with transplanting/weed
#     work and forcing her to take fewer days of wages in bad months.
#   reasoning: In this ecology and class, recurrent malaria/fever syndromes, chronic
#     respiratory problems, anemia/weakness after repeated pregnancies, or TB-like chronicity
#     could cause long-term limitation before age 31.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 19–31 (recurring pattern over many years)
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: After a close kinswoman in her husband’s village died in childbirth, she
#     took in the surviving infant/toddler as a foster-child alongside her own children,
#     feeding and watching the child while still going out for agricultural day-work
#     when she could.
#   reasoning: Raising non-biological orphans happened (kin fostering after parental
#     deaths), but a poor widow with five children had limited capacity to take in additional
#     dependents.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 27–31 (sustained caregiving period)

Venkamma was born on October 28, 1156, in the flat, hot country near Pedavegi, where Telugu was spoken in every lane and field. Local headmen collected revenue for whichever dynasty held the upper hand that season, and officials changed when larger powers pushed across Andhra. For her household it meant grain dues, occasional labor demands on tanks and bunds, and visits from messengers who spoke in clipped phrases. At home the year was counted by rains, transplanting, harvest, and the festivals when women carried offerings to the village goddess.

Her mother, Ankalamma, died after the birth. Her father Kondayya had already raised four children. Bhairava, the eldest at nine, laughed loudly and lifted Venkamma onto his hip. He brought her mango pieces in season and teased her about her short legs, making her chase him to get the last slice. Ranga, seven, spoke less; he listened to adults, repeated what they said, and corrected Venkamma when she miscounted handfuls of paddy for the chickens. Between them had been Sattamma, who died as an infant. Mallamma, three years older than Venkamma, took on the daily work of carrying and feeding her. She had help from a neighbor with milk and from Kondayya's sister Narsamma.

Venkamma grew up with the smell of wet rice husk and smoke from the cooking fire. She was very small even as a toddler; when she carried a pot she used both hands and walked slowly. Her father did not linger in the yard. Kondayya farmed what he could and took seasonal wage work when harvests demanded more hands than one family could supply. He came home with mud on his calves, ate quickly, and lay down. He remarried, and two years after Venkamma's birth, his new wife bore a son. The baby brother Chenna died within months. The stepmother died the following year. The women tied a length of neem leaves over the doorway and took a small plate with turmeric, ash, and a pinch of rice to the grama devata shrine. Mallamma held Venkamma's wrist to keep her from stepping into the wet paste smeared before the stone. Venkamma learned rules early: where to step, when to wash, how to keep the cooking area clean.

When Venkamma was ten, she began going to the fields with other women to pull weeds and carry bundles of seedlings. She kept her eyes down when men passed on the path. At dusk she liked the moment after the cooking was done, when she could sit on the threshold and eat rice with thin tamarind broth while the air cooled. She preferred that quiet to festival crowds. Mallamma sometimes hummed while grinding millet, and Venkamma joined in under her breath; she never sang loudly.

A year of heavy rain damaged some houses and flattened banana plants. Men were called for bund repair and tank clearing, and Kondayya’s seasonal work lasted longer. When he returned he spoke of officials and dues, but he could not explain them clearly. Venkamma listened and nodded without understanding the terms. She remembered only what mattered: how much rice to set aside and how quickly it would run out.

Her marriage was arranged in 1169, when she was twelve. The groom, Gopayya, came from a nearby village and worked a small plot but also hired himself out in peak seasons. On the day she left, Mallamma pressed a small ball of jaggery into her palm and told her to eat it later, when she was alone. Venkamma walked to her new village with a small bundle, keeping close to the women. She did not look back until she could no longer see the stand of trees near her father’s house.

The early years in Gopayya’s household were crowded with tasks. She rose before dawn, swept the yard, drew water, and set rice to boil. She placed a little lamp and flowers before a small household image and then went to the fields. When there was extra time, she ground spices carefully, keeping the stones clean. She disliked idle talk; it slowed the hands. Gopayya accepted that. He wanted food ready, clothes washed, and his children kept quiet. He did not beat her in anger, but when she failed to have the gruel on time he slapped the back of her shoulder once and called her slow. After that she woke earlier.

Her first son, Narayana, was born in 1171. A few months later news came that Bhairava had died at twenty-five. The message reached the village through travelers; no one from her natal home came. Venkamma sat with her baby in her lap and pressed her thumb hard into his heel while she listened. When her father Kondayya died in 1171, Ranga sent word through the same routes. Venkamma cried in short bursts while cooking, then washed her face and served food.

Kesava, her second son, was born in 1173. After that, fevers began to return each rainy season. They came with chills and aching limbs. She still went to transplant rice when the overseer called for women, but on some mornings she could not stand without gripping the door frame. She chewed ginger with salt and swallowed it with water before leaving. Her pay depended on being chosen at the field edge with the others.

A daughter, Peddamma, was born in 1176 and died within days. Pochamma the midwife washed the baby and placed a small amount of rice at the goddess stone. Venkamma did not speak while this was done. She folded and refolded a cloth until it sat in a neat square.

Sītamma was born in 1178. Venkamma liked the child's small hands and the way she stared at the fire without blinking. The following year, during harvest work, Venkamma slipped on a wet bund. The sickle caught her lower leg. Blood soaked her cloth before she could tie it. The wound swelled and oozed. For weeks she could not walk to the fields or carry water. Suri, a neighbor woman, brought rice gruel and helped clean the cut with boiled water and turmeric. Venkamma lay on a mat and listened to the sounds of other women leaving for work. When she could stand again, she returned too soon and the leg hurt for months.

During a season of sickness after the rains, Sītamma's belly swelled and she could not keep food down. Venkamma stayed up to wipe her mouth, then went to the fields anyway because she needed the wage. Sītamma died in 1181, at three years old. After the cremation Venkamma moved slowly for weeks. She forgot to eat until the afternoon. She sat staring at the yard while the children played, then suddenly cried and could not stop. Gopayya told her to keep her head and get on with it. She did not answer.

Her youngest daughter, Rudramma, was born in 1180. Two years later, in 1182, Gopayya died after a short illness. The village spoke of what a widow should do and where she should sit at rituals. Venkamma cut her spending down to bare food. She took day-work whenever it was offered. Erranna, the overseer, put her with the women who weeded and gathered stray sheaves. Her height kept her from the heaviest loads, and her pay stayed low.

She ran her household with tight routines. She measured rice by handfuls and tied knots in a cord to remember small debts. When Komati Subbayya advanced grain during a lean month, she did not understand his terms and had to ask Suri to repeat them. Once, when the children were hungry, she hid a small handful of husked rice before the day’s measure was checked. The next week Erranna watched her more closely, and she kept her hands visible.

In 1184 Rukmini, a kinswoman by marriage, died in childbirth. The infant lived. Venkamma took the child into her house in 1185 and nursed it with thin gruel, rocking it with her foot while she pounded grain. She carried the toddler to the field edge and left it with Suri during the hottest hours. Her own sons grew old enough to fetch water and watch Rudramma for short stretches. Narayana learned to sit still beside the grain pile to keep birds away. Kesava fought with other boys and came home bruised.

The fevers kept returning. Some seasons she missed days of work and lost wages. At times she stopped speaking except to issue short instructions. She lay down during daylight even when there was rice to grind. When Mallamma visited from the natal village once, Venkamma did not greet her at the threshold; she sat inside until Mallamma came in and touched her shoulder.

In May 1188 a cough spread through the village. Venkamma began coughing and could not keep up with field labor. She stayed on her mat, drank hot water when it was brought, and tried to rise to sweep but sat down again. She died on the twenty-fourth, at thirty-one. Her family cremated her outside the village, then placed rice and flowers at the household shrine and at the village goddess stone.
