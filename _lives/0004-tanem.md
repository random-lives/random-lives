Tanem was born in early summer in 6552 BC, where flat ground met marsh and tidal water. The camp sat back from the estuary among pines and hardwoods on slightly higher soil. The air smelled of resin and mud. Her mother rose before dawn, pounding nuts and heating greens, saving her strength. Her father brought in deer when he could and spent long stretches reshaping points and shafts until the edges were right.

She was the fifth child. Before she could walk, a brother died at birth. Another lasted two winters. The women wrapped the small bodies tight and carried them out without talk. Her mother’s hands kept moving. The older children learned to do what was needed without being told. Tanem grew in the middle of them, good at taking direction and finishing what someone started. She could sit for a long time picking burrs from cordage or sorting usable fibers from rotten ones, and she did not drift off when others did.

Their band shifted camp through the year. Late summer meant fish runs in the brackish creeks and shellfish in the shallows. Autumn meant nuts and deer farther inland. In winter they tucked shelters against a rise and watched what was stored. In spring they returned to the same edges—fresh shoots, bird eggs, fish trapped in narrow water. Tanem learned places by foot and smell. She held sequences in her head and followed them: how to tie a load so it did not slip, how to keep a coal alive under ash, how to dry a hide without letting it stiffen and crack. When she missed a step, it showed.

As a girl she talked easily. She moved between hearths, carried messages without twisting them, and laughed at the same story twice if it kept the peace. She did not push into disputes. When two sisters snapped at each other over a scraper, Tanem put her hand on the tool and waited until the shouting burned out.

At a seasonal camp near the estuary, when she had just begun to bleed, she went out at dusk to fetch water and cut reeds for mats. She carried a woven basket and a skin bag, following a path worn through low brush. The men were still at the main fire. An older man came after her into the darker edge of trees where the ground stayed soft and the insects rose in clouds. He clamped a hand over her mouth and forced her down. She fought until her strength broke, then went still because it did not stop.

She walked back with the skin bag half full, water slopping onto her legs. She did not speak. That night she slept with her back pressed to the shelter wall. In the morning she washed in cold water until her skin burned. She told no one. After that she watched where he stood and where the women sat, and she learned which paths were safe only in daylight.

In her late teens she became useful at births. She had steady hands and did what older women told her without arguing or trying to take credit. When she married, she moved to her spouse’s people, a couple of days along the same waterways. The jokes were different and the kin ties ran in patterns she had to learn fast—who took offense, who settled things, who kept score.

Her husband hunted deer and smaller game. He was strong and he liked being seen as the one who brought meat in. He could be generous when others were watching and sharp when they were not. Tanem learned to keep meals from turning into quarrels. She handed a portion to a hungry household before he made a show of it, and she spoke well of him in a way that kept him from turning it into boasting.

She carried one pregnancy to term later than most women. The child was a girl, loud and hungry. Tanem kept her against her body while she worked. She learned the baby’s cries the way she learned wind shifts. The child died before her third winter, hot with fever and then quiet. Tanem did not wail. She sat through the night with the small body on her lap, rocking without rhythm, jaw tight. At dawn she walked with the older women to place the body where the soil stayed dry. Her hands shook only when she tied the final binding.

She did not conceive again. The pairing held, but it changed. Without a living child, her place in the household rested on work and on her husband’s kin. In a lean season, when smoked meat hung thin and the creek yielded less, his relatives pressed for more of what Tanem had dried and set aside. Her husband wanted to look openhanded in front of them. Tanem refused. She named what they needed for the days ahead and would not soften it.

He struck her and kicked her hard in the hip as she tried to rise. She tasted blood from her lip. The bruise spread down her thigh. She limped around camp with her face set and did not let anyone see her cry. She did not leave him. She stopped shielding him. When he wanted to hold meat back for praise and trading words, she made him ask for it in front of everyone.

As she aged, people came to her for the things that scared them. A child would not stop coughing. A cut grew hot and wet. A woman’s labor stalled and her eyes went flat. Tanem did not claim new powers. She used what she had been taught and remembered it without slipping. She kept the steps in order: which bark to chew for pain, which plant to drink to empty the stomach, how to rinse a wound with hot water and scrape away dead flesh, how to pack it clean and keep flies off. She spoke in short instructions and made others do their part. When someone tried to skip a step, she stared until they stopped.

In her late thirties a winter sickness ran through the camps along the waterways. It started as cough and throat rawness and then tightened the chest until breath came hard. Adults lay wrapped in hides, eyes watering, ribs lifting too fast. The old died quickly. Tanem moved from hearth to hearth with heated stones wrapped in hide, with bitter teas and warmed water. She kept fires going. She made the young haul water even when they complained and tried to hide in the dark.

When spring brought the scattered groups together again, the older men and women who settled disputes and chose where to camp asked Tanem to stand with them at the water’s edge. They wanted her to speak the thanks and the cleansing words, to mark the end of the sickness. She nodded once and went to gather what she needed—clean water, smoke from certain plants, a strip of hide to bind an offering.

That season she showed younger women what she did with her hands: how to support a laboring body so the woman did not tear, how to rinse and keep cloth and hands free of blood and dirt, how to watch for bleeding that did not slow. She did not make it gentle. She corrected mistakes as they happened and made them repeat the steps until they held.

Age made her smaller and harder to brush aside. Men who would have talked over a younger woman listened when she told them to keep away from a fevered shelter or to stop crowding a laboring woman. She lived in her husband’s kin household, surrounded by people who measured her worth against theirs. Some resented her authority. Others relied on it. She met the friction by working and letting the results stand. In quiet hours she sat with children who were not hers and taught them to twist fibers into a strong line. If a child lied to her face, she corrected them without warmth and set them back to the task until it was done right.

By her seventies her joints swelled and her appetite thinned. Short walks left her breathing hard. Her husband still lived, slower now, hands stiff when he tried to reshape a point. Tanem stopped going far with gathering parties and stayed near camp, sorting dried plants, checking smoking racks, rubbing fat into cracked skin. The winter before she died she began to waste. Food went in and came back up. She shivered even close to the fire. Her voice grew quiet, but her instructions stayed exact.

On February 9, 6477 BC, deep in winter, she lay on hides inside the shelter, smoke trapped low in the cold air. Her husband’s sister fed her warm broth in small sips from a skin cup. Tanem swallowed twice and turned her face toward the wall. Her breathing grew shallow and then stopped. Outside, someone split kindling. The crack of wood carried through the frozen air.
