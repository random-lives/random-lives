Ayyadurai was born on May 18, 1637, in Karaipadi in the dry interior of Tamil country, where village life ran through rain-fed fields and small tanks. The area answered to local Nayaka-era power and poligars, and taxes and demands moved downward through village headmen and patrons. He grew up speaking Tamil, lighting a lamp at home, bringing flowers or a coconut to the local shrine, and walking with the crowd when the village festival drums started.

He entered a household already thinned by deaths. Before he was born, his mother had buried babies and toddlers: a boy who lived to four, two girls who died small, another girl who died at one, and two baby boys lost at birth. The survivors were older and already tied to the village’s work. His oldest living brother, a man born in 1621, carried the family’s heaviest loads and took work where he could find it. Ayyadurai’s father was absent from his earliest memory, and the house ran on whatever his mother’s kin could spare—handfuls of grain, a place to sleep during hard weeks, a promise put in with a landholder for a day of work.

His oldest sister still alive, born in 1631, did the work of an adult while she was still a girl. She hauled water, scraped pots, and kept the smallest children quiet when neighbors came through. In 1646, when Ayyadurai was nine, she died. The death left more than grief; it left chores that still had to be done. His mother leaned on the next sister, Sellayi, born in 1635, and on Vellaiyan, the brother born in 1633. Ayyadurai became the one sent on errands because he was quick on his feet and easy to command. He carried a sickle to cut fodder, gathered thorny brush for fuel, and brought small measures of grain back from a kin household with his eyes down.

Ayyadurai never learned letters. He learned faces, paths, and whose field boundaries could not be crossed without a shout. He learned when the village would tolerate a boy pulling at a fallen branch and when someone would beat him for it. He liked the hour after sunset when the heat dropped and the cooking fires lit up the lanes. He sat then near the edge of the street with other boys and listened to men talk. He laughed at the same crude jokes every season and remembered them, repeating them badly at home until Sellayi told him to stop.

In 1654 his brother born in 1621 died at thirty-three. Ayyadurai was seventeen. That year the household stopped pretending it had a protector within it. Vellaiyan and Sellayi kept the family connected to kin, but Ayyadurai had to feed himself. He moved for work the way poor men did: short distances, from one village to the next, sleeping in verandas or under eaves, taking weeding work in one place and harvest work in another. In a year of poor rain, when grain prices rose and wages came late, he learned to accept broken measures and clipped promises. He also learned to press when he could. If a man owed him a day’s grain, he came back twice and waited where everyone could see him.

In 1657, when he was twenty, he married Ponni from a nearby hamlet. The marriage joined two poor households that needed each other. Ponni cooked thin gruel when there was no rice, carried water without complaint, and spoke sharply when Ayyadurai came home with nothing. Their first son was born in 1658 and died the same year. A second son was born in 1660 and died the same year. They spent money they did not have on small offerings and on a healer’s powders, and then went back to work. Ayyadurai went out for day labor when the fields called; Ponni took whatever tasks a poor woman could take without a patron’s protection.

A son born in 1662 lived. They named him Kannan. With a child alive in the house, Ayyadurai acted as if he owned the lane he walked on. He carried the boy on his hip to the temple festival, pushed through the crowd to see the cart, and bought a palm-sugar sweet once a year, sucking the last bits from his teeth long after it was gone. He did not drink much, but he gambled on dice when he had spare copper, losing fast and accusing others of cheating. He argued over little things and then begged a favor the next morning as if nothing had happened.

Another son was born in 1665 and died in 1666. In 1667 a son lived, later called Muthu, and in 1670 a daughter, Meenakshi. Ponni kept the children fed by stretching grain and by sending them out to pick up fallen heads of millet after the threshing. Ayyadurai worked where Vellaiyan could place him, and Vellaiyan did it because kin were expected to do it, and because Ayyadurai did not understand what was safe to say to a landholder and what brought trouble.

In 1670, when he was thirty-three, Ayyadurai fought a man over wages. The harvest had ended, and the landholder’s agent tried to pay laborers in grain with a short measure. Ayyadurai shouted, the other laborer shouted back, and Ayyadurai swung a stick he kept for dogs. The blow landed on the man’s shoulder and split the skin. Men dragged Ayyadurai away, and the agent docked him the rest of his pay. For months after, he found doors closed when he asked for work. Vellaiyan cursed him for it, then quietly brought him to a different village where the story was thinner.

In 1673 a daughter was born and died in 1675. By then the household counted deaths the way it counted sacks of grain: with bitterness and tiredness. Ayyadurai’s mornings started with a quick wash, a lamp lit at the corner of the room, and a muttered promise to bring something to the shrine if the day went well. He walked out before sunrise in the cool hour, liked the smell of damp earth when the northeast monsoon rains came, and hated the days after cyclonic storms when roads turned to mud and grain movement stopped. When rain failed, he watched the market with narrowed eyes, hearing numbers but not grasping how quickly they would ruin him.

In 1677, at forty, a son was born, the last child, and he lived. That year Ayyadurai spent long stretches away from home for seasonal work, moving between villages with other laborers. During irrigation and weeding, he began meeting a married woman from a neighboring hamlet at the edge of the fields. They spoke little. They used the cover of work and the paths between bunds. It continued until gossip reached Ponni’s ears and reached the woman’s household too. The meetings stopped. Ayyadurai did not apologize. He argued, then went silent for days, eating without taste and sitting outside at dusk with his back against a wall.

In the late 1670s, news traveled with merchants and with frightened men: Maratha forces pushing south, raids and war pressures in the Kaveri–Thanjavur region, levies rising, grain moving under guard. Even in the interior, village demands grew. Headmen wanted more labor, more fees, more compliance. For a man in Ayyadurai’s position, it meant fewer choices and more punishment when he spoke out.

In 1682 Ponni died. Ayyadurai was forty-five. Her illness dragged on, and he depended on Sellayi’s help and on Meenakshi’s hands to keep the household running. After Ponni’s death he kept a small nuclear household: Kannan already a grown worker, Muthu and Meenakshi still at home, and the youngest boy still small. He worked when he could, but he also stayed near the children more than he had before, watching for fevers and for the petty cruelties of neighbors. He took pride in small order: a swept patch of floor, a pot filled before night, a child washed before the festival.

In October 1688, fever swept through the area after the rains. Ayyadurai fell sick on October 20, 1688, and died that day in Karaipadi, at fifty-one. His household had no surplus, no land to pass down, and no written mark of his name. The people who knew him remembered a man who fought over grain and still carried his children when the drums started.
