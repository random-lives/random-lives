Ayyadurai was born in May 1637 in a small Tamil-speaking village in the dry interior between the Kaveri country and the scrubland further west. The place answered to local headmen and revenue men under Nayaka rule, and soldiers and tax collectors came through when larger powers fought over the region. In the village lanes people spoke Tamil, kept oil lamps in the evenings, and carried offerings to the small shrines and the main temple on festival days.

He was the last child in a house already crowded with children. Ten older siblings had been born before him. By the time he could remember faces, some were already gone. Two sisters died as infants. Another died at three. A brother lived into his thirties and then disappeared from the village talk in a single season. The family counted the living and the dead without ceremony. His father was not in the house when Ayyadurai was small. Nobody spoke of him in a way a child could understand, and nobody brought him back.

His mother, Meenakshi, stayed in the house and stayed sick. Her kin fed the household more than her hands did. Women from the same street brought a pot of gruel, a handful of millet, or a little tamarind. When Meenakshi could stand, she washed vessels and swept, then lay down again. Ayyadurai learned early that food came from other people’s fields and other people’s stores.

He did not go to any school. No palm-leaf writing ever lay open in front of him. He learned the names of tools and the calls used with bullocks. He learned which man would lend a sickle and which one would demand it back before sunset. When he was old enough to carry weight, he carried bundles of firewood, then sheaves, then baskets of earth for bund repairs. When harvest came he worked from dawn until the light failed, and slept where the other hired hands slept, under a cart or in a corner of a shed.

Monsoon years set the tone of his childhood. When rains came on time, work spread out: hoeing, weeding, watching birds from the edges of the fields, and cutting fodder. When the rains failed, wages were argued down and measured in smaller heaps. Grain merchants raised prices. Small households stretched rice with thin gruel. Once, after a bad season, men walked to nearby villages looking for any work at all, and returned with nothing but a blistered heel and a story about another place doing no better.

As a young man he moved between hamlets within a day’s walk, following work and the word of a patron. He slept in verandas, in cattle sheds, under a neem tree near a tank. He took whatever tasks came: cutting thorn scrub for fencing, digging channels, carrying pots of water for transplanting when the soil was still wet enough. He was quick to agree to instructions and slow to understand the reasons for them. When an older man told him the bund needed to be higher on one side, he did the lifting and tamping where the man pointed, then forgot and had to be corrected again.

He married while still young. His wife was called Ponnammal. She came from another low household in the same cluster of villages. The marriage brought a few cooking pots, a mat, and help for his mother, who lay more and more often. Ponnammal cooked thin rice and greens, carried water, and kept the small space in order. Ayyadurai had little to offer beyond his arms and his wages.

Children came quickly. Eight were born. Two boys died as newborns before they were fully folded into the household’s routine. Another boy lived long enough to crawl, then died during a season of sickness moving through the lanes. A girl died at two. The children who lived learned to eat with little fuss. Ayyadurai’s older surviving son, Raman, grew into a man before his father died. Another son, Kannan, reached adulthood too. Two daughters, Lakshmi and Valli, lived; they helped their mother, carried water, and went with her to temple festivals when there was enough grain left after dues and debts.

When Ayyadurai was in his early thirties, he worked a harvest in a village east of his birth place. The headman’s men measured out wages in grain. The pile set aside for the hired hands was short. Ayyadurai argued with another laborer, a man named Muthu, about whether to take the small share or refuse it and risk being turned away. The argument spread from words to shoving. Ayyadurai grabbed a stick used for turning sheaves and struck Muthu across the shoulder and back. Muthu fell and curled, and the men around them pulled Ayyadurai away. The grain was taken anyway. The bruise on Muthu’s back lasted longer than the anger.

His household did not stay steady. Meenakshi died while the children were still small, and her kin stopped bringing food once her body had been burned and the days of ritual feeding were done. Ponnammal’s work filled the gap for a time. Then she fell ill in a bad year when the northeast rains came hard and late, breaking field edges and washing silt into channels. Water stood where it should have drained, and mosquitoes bred in the wet ditches. Fever moved through the village street. Ponnammal did not recover. After she died, Ayyadurai kept the smallest children close and sent the older ones to fetch food and water. He depended on his wife’s relatives for help, and on his older son to earn.

Widowhood changed his movements. He still went out for seasonal work, but he returned more often and watched the house more closely. He lost track of small debts and the dates they were due. He promised labor to two men in the same week and tried to satisfy both, running from one field to another and earning anger instead of grain.

In his late thirties and early forties he took work in a neighboring hamlet during irrigation and weeding seasons. There he began meeting a married woman named Alamelu at the edge of the fields where the path dipped behind a grove. They met when her husband was away and when other women were busy at the tank. He came back again and again, drawn by the private attention and the small gifts of food she could spare. It ended when talk started among the women who drew water together. Alamelu’s husband confronted her family, and Ayyadurai stopped taking work in that hamlet.

By the late 1670s, new pressures reached even the inland villages. Men spoke of Maratha horsemen farther east and south, of raids and demands. Local revenue men became harsher. More grain was taken at threshing floors. When markets shook, wages did not rise with prices. Ayyadurai’s household ate less, and his older son bargained harder for work and for advances.

In 1688, after the rains, Ayyadurai caught an acute fever. He lay on a mat in the small house with his younger children still sleeping near him. The family tried cooling water, thin gruel, and a village healer’s herbs. He sweated through his cloth and could not stand without support. On October 20, 1688, the fever took him, and the men of his street carried his body to be burned outside the settlement.
