Ayyadurai was born on May 18, 1637, in a small village in the dry interior of Tamil country, where local headmen and poligars answered to Nayaka rulers and their revenue agents. He spoke Tamil, kept a small lamp burning for household puja, and carried offerings to the local shrine on festival days. News came from the Kaveri towns and the coast in scraps, through grain buyers, temple servants, and men returning from seasonal work.

He arrived as the last child in a house already crowded with children and grief. Ten older siblings had been born before him. Three had died before they could speak in full sentences, and others carried the marks of fevers and hunger years. His father was gone from the house before Ayyadurai learned to place a name to him. The household held together with kin help and whatever his mother could pull from neighbors and relatives. She kept him close, sat him near the threshold while she bargained for a handful of grain, and sent him to carry water when his legs were steady.

His childhood memory held the feel of dust on the tongue and the sound of women pounding grain. In years when the rains failed, he watched the pots grow lighter and the talk grow sharper. In years when the northeast monsoon came hard and wrong, water stood in low places, millet rotted, and people argued over what could be salvaged. He learned to do tasks by copying. He learned prayers by hearing them. Letters never entered his hands. When someone showed him a palm-leaf account, he stared at the scratches and then looked away.

As a boy he followed older men to the fields to pick stones and pull weeds for a measure of grain. He trailed behind carts on market days to help push through sand. Once, when a traveling storyteller stopped at the edge of the village for a festival crowd, Ayyadurai sat as close as he could, laughing at the loud voices and the mock fights. He liked the salted porridge served in a leaf bowl after temple processions, and he watched the drummers’ hands until the rhythm settled in his body. He also learned how people watched him back. His household’s place in village life kept him at the margins of courtyards and councils. The rules were never spoken plainly, but they were enforced.

By his late teens he moved for work, not far, shifting between villages within a day’s walk. He cut fodder, carried bundles, repaired bunds, and joined harvest gangs. He slept under verandas or in sheds when someone needed hands for a week. He took his morning bath at the tank when there was water, then rubbed a little ash on his forehead, folded his hands briefly, and ate whatever he had: cold gruel, a piece of ragi bread, sometimes a pinch of tamarind and salt if someone shared. He liked sitting with other laborers at the edge of the fields at midday, trading rude jokes and listening for which landlord was paying in grain and which tried to delay.

He married while still young. Her name was Meenakshi. She came from a nearby place and understood the same boundaries he had grown up with. Their household stayed nuclear, separate from married brothers and large joint arrangements, because there was no land to bind them together and no security to make a big house stable. They lived in a small structure that needed patching after heavy rains, and they moved when work pulled them. Meenakshi carried water, cooked thin gruel, and brought their children into the world one after another.

Eight children were born. Two died the same season they were born, and another died before his second year. Ayyadurai carried a small bundle to the cremation ground and came back to work the next morning. He did not speak much about it. When sickness came through the hamlets, he went to the shrine with camphor and a coconut if he could afford it, and when he could not, he stood with the others while someone else paid. He grew used to counting losses and still counting mouths to feed.

In his early thirties, during a harvest in a village not his own, he fought openly. A landlord’s agent withheld grain wages, claiming the sheaves were light and the work careless. Ayyadurai argued, then another laborer mocked him and shoved him. Ayyadurai grabbed a stick used for propping bundles and struck the man across the shoulder and back. The man went down in the stubble, shouting. Others pulled Ayyadurai away. That night he kept to the edge of the shed, alert for retaliation. The next day he left before sunrise and did not return to that village for a long time.

He worked best when a stronger man set the pace and told him what to do first. When left to plan work on his own, he started tasks in the wrong order, forgot tools, and lost track of small obligations that mattered to landlords. He also took what he could when he thought he could get away with it—an extra handful of grain when measuring, a bundle of firewood from land he did not own. He did it quickly and without apology. With people he liked, he was easy company. He laughed at simple teasing. He shared tobacco when he had it and took it when someone offered. His closest friend in his moving years was a laborer named Karuppan, who could bargain with agents without raising his voice. Ayyadurai followed Karuppan’s lead when wages were being set.

In his late thirties, during irrigation and weeding seasons away from home, he began meeting a married woman from a neighboring hamlet. Her name was Ponnammal. They met where the field paths narrowed, near a clump of scrub and a shallow channel. It started with talk and small touches while others worked nearby, then became a secret pattern. He brought her a little salt fish once, wrapped in leaf, and she laughed at how proud he looked carrying it. The meetings continued through parts of three seasons until gossip hardened into accusation. Someone’s aunt confronted Ponnammal at a water place, and Ayyadurai heard from Karuppan that the husband had begun asking questions. Ayyadurai stopped going near that hamlet.

Meenakshi died before Ayyadurai reached old age. After her death he kept the household with the youngest children. By then one son was grown enough to work, another was nearing manhood, and two daughters survived into adulthood, but their lives were tied to other households and arrangements. Ayyadurai’s home at the end held only him and a small number of unmarried children. He cooked when he had to, stirring gruel with a stick and burning it often, and relied on neighbors to trade him a bit of tamarind or greens. When a child fell sick, he sat close through the night, warming water and pressing cloths, then went out at dawn to find work anyway. He took pride in getting a son placed in a harvest gang without having to beg loudly for it.

The wider world pressed harder as he aged. Grain prices jumped in bad years when the rains failed, and laborers fought for work. In years when storms damaged crops and washed out paths, he walked farther to find employment. In the late 1670s and into the 1680s, talk of Maratha forces and war pressure reached even inland villages. Revenue demands rose. Agents came through more often, and villages argued over what could be paid. Markets became jumpy; buyers offered less and demanded more. Ayyadurai kept his head down, moved when a place turned hostile, and returned to familiar tanks and shrines when he needed kin help.

In October 1688, after the rains, fever took him. It began with chills and a pounding headache. He stopped going out for work and lay on a mat while one of the older children fetched water. Sweat soaked his cloth. On October 20, 1688, the fever ended his life in his house. The body was carried out the same day, and the household turned back to finding grain for the next meal.
