Tongzhou on the north bank of the Yangtze sat under the Ming magistrate's yamen, with taxes assessed in grain and cloth. The household in Liuqiao spoke the local Jiangnan speech with Wu turns of phrase and kept an ancestor tablet in the main room, with incense lit on festival days and offerings set at the Earth God shrine by the lane. That year Manchu armies had crossed the Wall; the news came south slowly, carried by traders and refugees who spoke of burning cities and soldiers in strange armor.

The father, Shen Mingde, ran a small pressing shop beside the fields. He bought seed from neighbors, boiled and steamed it, then worked the beam press with two apprentices and an ox, selling oil and cake at the market. Three years earlier his first son, Shen Dayou, arrived. Mingde's first wife died soon after, and he took a second wife, Li Shi, to manage the kitchen, accounts, and cloth work. She spun and wove at home, kept thread in a basket by the door, and watched the boy while the men worked the press.

On the last day of the twelfth month, Li Shi went into hard labor before dawn. A midwife came from the next hamlet, heated water, and tied her sleeves back. The child emerged with bruising from the birth and never cried strongly. They wiped him, rubbed his back, and tried to clear his mouth. The father stood at the threshold, calling for another kettle and sending an apprentice for ginger. The infant died before nightfall on the day he was born. They wrapped the body in a scrap of cloth and buried it outside the village without ceremony. No tablet was made; he had not lived long enough for a name.
