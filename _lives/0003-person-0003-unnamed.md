On December 30, 1643, in a farming village near Tongzhou in Jiangsu, under the Ming dynasty’s county yamen and tax registers, a boy was delivered in the household of Zhang Shunyi. The family spoke the local river-plain speech shaped by Wu sounds from across the Yangtze. Incense smoke from the family altar clung to the main room, and the Earth God shrine by the lane held fresh ash from morning offerings.

Shunyi ran a small processing workshop beside the house. Apprentices slept on mats in a side room and rose before daylight to turn stone rollers and tend the fire. Bales of fiber and finished cloth moved through the courtyard, and his wife, Li shi, kept the household stores, boiled meals for workers, and spun thread when the children slept. Shunyi kept a concubine, Wang shi, in an inner room. She carried water, watched the children, and answered to Li shi in the women’s quarters.

Their first child, a son, had been born in 1640. He was three that winter and still alive when the second boy came. The birth on December 30 went badly. The child was born limp, and the midwife rubbed him hard and pried his mouth open with a fingernail. Li shi bled and shook on the bed while Wang shi held a lamp close to the infant’s face.

The boy never cried. Before nightfall on the same day, he was dead.
