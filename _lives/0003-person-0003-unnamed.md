In 1643, the Tongzhou countryside by the canals north of the Yangtze still answered to the Ming county yamen, even as armies and taxes pressed the region. The family in Liuqiao spoke the local Sinitic speech with Wu turns of phrase heard from boatmen and traders coming from across the river. They kept an ancestral tablet in the main room and burned incense to local gods at festival times.

The father, Shen Yao, ran a small processing shop near the market path, taking in seed and turning it to oil with a press and a stone mill. Apprentices slept on mats behind the work area. He kept a second woman in the household after his first wife died; the stepmother, Madam Wang, managed the cooking, washing, and the endless spinning and mending that kept cloth on growing children.

Their first son, Shen Da, had been born in 1640. In winter of 1643, with Da still a small child underfoot, Madam Wang went into labor again. A midwife came from a nearby hamlet. The baby boy arrived near the end of the day on December 30, 1643. The delivery turned hard and long. When he emerged, he did not cry and did not draw breath. The midwife rubbed him, cleared his mouth, and tried again. Shen Yao waited outside the room, then stepped in when the midwife told him the child was dead.
