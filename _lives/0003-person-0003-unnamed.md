In December 1643, the Ming dynasty still claimed Jiangsu, but soldiers and tax collectors moved through the lower Yangtze as the state broke apart. In Liuqiao outside Tongzhou near the river routes to the sea, a Han household spoke the local Sinitic speech with Wu sounds from across the water and kept an altar for ancestors, lighting incense and setting out bowls at festival times.

The father, Shen Wenxing, ran a small processing shop beside the family house, with a workroom that smelled of pressed oil and damp fiber. Apprentices slept on mats near the tools. He kept accounts on a board and sent his older boy, Shen Dalang, out to carry messages to suppliers and to fetch water from the well. Wenxing had buried his first wife and taken Li Shiniang into the household; she managed the hearth, the store jars, and the spinning basket, turning cotton into thread between cooking and mending.

Dalang was three when Li Shiniang’s labor began, late in the day on December 30. The midwife came from a nearby lane. Women boiled water and set a brazier close to the bed. The delivery dragged. The child came out limp, with bruising at the head and a cord wound tight. The midwife rubbed him hard with cloth and blew air into his mouth. Li Shiniang held him once. Before night, the newborn was dead.
