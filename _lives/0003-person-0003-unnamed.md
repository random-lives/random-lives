Late in the Ming, Tongzhou county on the flat land near the Yangtze’s mouths was governed through the magistrate’s yamen and village elders. The people in Liuqiao spoke the local Wu-tinged Sinitic speech and kept household altars for ancestors, Tudigong, and the Kitchen God.

The child who never received a recorded name was born on December 30, 1643, the second of seven. His father, Shen Yulang, ran a small processing workshop behind the house, with a stone mill and wooden vats where apprentices helped press oil and grind seed and grain for neighbors who paid in cash or in kind. Yulang kept a secondary woman in the household after his first wife died; the woman managing the inner rooms that winter was his wife Li Wen, who spun cotton thread at a wheel between feeding the stove and watching the children.

Their eldest, Shen Da, was three and already climbed onto the millstone to watch the apprentices. When labor started, an older midwife from a nearby hamlet boiled water, laid out clean cloth, and burned incense at the ancestor tablets. The birth went hard and long. The boy came out bruised and quiet, and he never drew a strong breath.

Before dusk Li Wen washed him, wrapped him in a strip of cotton, and laid him on a board. Yulang lit three sticks of incense, bowed toward the household altar, and placed a small dish of rice and a cup of tea before the tablets. The body was buried in a shallow grave at the edge of the family plot, with paper money burned beside it.
