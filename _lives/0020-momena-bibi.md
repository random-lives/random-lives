# ethnicity: Bengali (Bangali) agrarian society of north Bengal (Bengali-speaking)
# father_occupation: Cultivator (smallholder and/or sharecropper/tenant farmer; primary
#   identity as farmer)
# historical_context:
# - event: Recurring monsoon floods and riverbank erosion in the Brahmaputra–Teesta

#     relocation within the district.
#   timing: throughout life; especially ages 20–50 (c. 1901–1931)
# - event: Malaria endemicity and periodic severe malaria seasons in Bengal, affecting
#     labor availability and household health (fever waves, quinine use when available).
#   timing: throughout life; peaks often in monsoon/post-monsoon (c. 1880s–1930s)

#   timing: age 33–37 (1914–1918)
# - event: The Great Depression’s impact on agrarian Bengal—falling crop prices and
#     tightened rural credit—making it harder for smallholders/sharecroppers to service

#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-7
#     key_events:
#     - Raised in an extended patrilineal homestead with strong elders’ authority and
#       folk-syncretic protective rites because of repeated infant deaths in the family.
#     - Limited exposure to schooling; learns by imitation and repetitive chores rather
#       than instruction-heavy tasks.
#     - Early encounters with seasonal floods/fevers shape a cautious, routine-bound
#       temperament.
#     phase: Early childhood in natal joint household (Kurigram area)
#   - age_range: 8-17
#     key_events:
#     - 'Increasing workload: rice husking, water/fuel collection, minding younger children
#       of the joint household; becomes known as dependable but quiet.'
#     - Marriage arrangements begin; she is evaluated more for obedience and work capacity
#       than for education.
#     - 'Shows adaptive limitations: difficulty with counting, remembering complex instructions,
#       or navigating unfamiliar places alone.'
#     phase: Later childhood and adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-30
#     key_events:
#     - Marriage into husband’s joint household; heavy expectations in cooking and field-help
#       roles.
#     - Multiple pregnancies and infant/child losses; household turns to vows, amulets,
#       and shrine/pir visits as practical protection.
#     - Consolidates identity as an agricultural helper—transplanting, weeding, harvesting—paired
#       with strict household routines.
#     phase: Young married life and early motherhood (patrilocal joint household)
#   - age_range: 31-45
#     key_events:
#     - Household experiences local relocation within north Bengal due to flood/erosion
#       and tenancy pressures, without leaving the region.
#     - Harvest and market volatility (WWI period into 1920s) affects grain prices and
#       debt relations with mahajans.
#     - Momena’s role becomes more managerial in daily labor allocation (who cooks,
#       who weeds, who fetches water), though still under male/elder authority.
#     phase: 'Midlife: cultivation work, local relocation, and economic stress'
#   - age_range: 46-53
#     key_events:
#     - Husband dies; she becomes a widowed elder residing in a stem-family arrangement,
#       dependent on adult children/affines.
#     - Takes on intensive caregiving for frail parents-in-law while continuing lighter

#     narrative_role: Final infant loss; motivates protective folk practices at the
#       household shrine/pir and shapes Momena’s mother’s worldview.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Few close friendships outside kin; relies on one or two familiar
#       women for information, making her slower to adapt during relocation or new household
#       demands.
#     scene: At weddings/market days she stays behind the women’s line, speaks only
#       when addressed, and prefers repetitive tasks (sorting paddy, cleaning utensils)
#       over gossip or group singing.
#     timing: adolescence through adulthood (ages 12-53)
#     trait: Extraversion (very low)
#   - consequence: Valued for reliability, but becomes overburdened; family assumes
#       she will absorb extra work, especially during crises and elder-care.
#     scene: She rises before dawn, keeps the hearth area swept, re-ties paddy bundles
#       the same way every time, and is the person elders trust to guard seed grain
#       and maintain routine during busy seasons.
#     timing: young married life onward (ages 18-53)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (very high)
#   - consequence: Creates friction with co-wives/sisters-in-law; contributes to being
#       targeted in household conflicts, including the early domestic violence episode.
#     scene: When criticized, she becomes blunt and stubborn—refusing to redo tasks
#       she believes were done correctly, and speaking sharply to younger in-laws about
#       wasted grain or laziness.
#     timing: mostly midlife (ages 30-50)
#     trait: Agreeableness (low)
#   - consequence: Slower uptake of new practices (e.g., market-oriented changes, unfamiliar
#       medicines), sometimes increasing dependence on elders’ decisions.
#     scene: She distrusts new farming advice or novel remedies, preferring inherited
#       routines and familiar shrine practices; she resists changes in food preparation
#       or childcare methods suggested by others.
#     timing: adulthood (ages 18-53)
#     trait: Openness (low)
#   - consequence: Builds a reputation for trustworthiness, but can leave the household
#       less opportunistic in navigating patronage or bargaining.
#     scene: Even during scarcity she refuses to take grain from a neighbor’s threshing
#       floor and insists borrowed rice be measured and returned; she avoids village
#       intrigue and does not flatter officials/land agents.
#     timing: adulthood (ages 25-53)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (high)
#   - consequence: No schooling/literacy; limited bargaining power with traders/mahajans;
#       higher vulnerability to being blamed for mistakes and to exploitation during
#       debt negotiations.
#     scene: She struggles with counting and money (mixes coin values, cannot track
#       debt terms), gets lost if sent beyond familiar paths, and needs tasks broken
#       into simple steps; she learns best by rote and repetition.
#     timing: visible from childhood (ages 6-53)
#     trait: Intelligence (very low) / Mild intellectual disability
#   - consequence: Short bursts of anxiety reinforce reliance on ritual protection and
#       strict routines; occasional irritability worsens household conflicts.
#     scene: During children’s fevers or flood seasons she becomes tense, sleepless,
#       and watchful, repeatedly checking the baby’s breathing or the stored grain,
#       but returns to routine once the danger passes.
#     timing: young motherhood and crisis periods (ages 19-45)
#     trait: Neuroticism (moderate)
# number_of_children: '7'
# number_of_siblings: '3'
# occupation: Agricultural helper in family cultivation (regular field work alongside
#   domestic tasks; unpaid family labor)
# religion: Mixed/folk-syncretic practice centered on local shrines/pirs/deities alongside

# - event: During the paddy-harvest season, someone cut and carried off several sheaves
#     from her family’s field-edge plot overnight, and the household also lost a chicken
#     from the homestead yard.
#   reasoning: Petty theft of grain/livestock and disputes over crops/tools were common
#     in densely settled agrarian areas, but poor households also had fewer valuables
#     worth stealing.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: late 20s to early 30s (c. 1910–1914)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: After a major monsoon flood and riverbank erosion damaged their dwelling
#     and ruined the aman crop, the family had to take grain loans from a mahajan and
#     temporarily mortgage/pledge their small tenancy rights to get through the hungry
#     season.
#   reasoning: Flood/river erosion risk in Kurigram-Rangpur, tenancy insecurity, medical
#     costs, and widowhood make at least one episode of acute hardship or debt crisis
#     fairly likely even for 'poor-to-middling' peasants.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: early 40s (c. 1922–1925)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: In her husband’s joint household, she was beaten with hands and a thin stick
#     during a dispute over cooking and field-work expectations, leaving bruising and
#     forcing her to stay with nearby kin for several days.
#   reasoning: Physical discipline/assault by husbands or senior household members occurred
#     at nontrivial rates in joint rural households; widowhood implies she was married
#     long enough for at least one episode to be plausible.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late teens to early 20s (c. 1899–1903)
#   type: domestic_violence
# - event: As her parents-in-law became frail, she became the main caregiver—cooking
#     soft rice, bathing them, and managing their medicines and toileting while still
#     helping with transplanting and weeding in the fields.
#   reasoning: As a married woman in a patrilocal system, caregiving most often focused
#     on parents-in-law; if she remained in a stem household, tending an aging mother-in-law/father-in-law
#     is quite plausible.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: late 40s to early 50s (c. 1929–1934)

Momena Bibi was born on July 31, 1881 in a village of Kurigram, in the northern districts of Bengal under British rule. The land belonged to the floodplains of the Brahmaputra and Teesta, thick with rice fields, low trees, ponds, and muddy lanes. Her family spoke the Rangpur dialect of Bengali at home and dealt with landlords and rent collectors in the same speech, with the weight of colonial land revenue behind every demand.

Her mother had already buried two baby girls. The first had been born in 1877 and died before she finished her first day. The second came in 1879 and died as quickly. In Momena’s infancy, old women in the homestead tied black threads at her wrist and hung small charms near where she slept. The household went to a local shrine when sickness passed through the village. They offered sweets when they could, and a little oil when they could not. In 1883 her mother gave birth again. That younger sister died the same year, and the adults spoke in short sentences for days after, careful in the way they washed bowls and swept the yard.

Momena grew into a quiet child who learned best when someone showed her, hands on the task. Words alone did not settle into her head. She could not keep numbers straight. When her aunt sent her to buy salt, she returned with the wrong measure and the wrong coin. After that, they stopped sending her beyond the lanes she knew. She carried water from the pond, fed chickens, and husked paddy with a steady rhythm. She woke before sunrise without needing to be called, and she became strict about how things were placed—pots stacked the same way, rice spread thin on the mat, firewood arranged by thickness.

As a teenager she spoke little with girls her age. When women sat to talk and laugh after the evening meal, she stayed near the edge, rubbing rice from the mortar or combing chaff from a basket. She trusted one person outside family: a neighbor named Amina, a woman with a quick tongue who teased her for counting the same bundles twice. Amina did not mind her silence. They sat together during transplanting, feet sunk in mud, passing seedlings down the line.

In 1898, at seventeen, Momena married Jalal Miah and moved to his family’s compound. It was a joint household, with Jalal’s parents, a brother, and the brother’s wife sharing the yard and the work. The women’s days began in the dark. Momena swept the cooking area, scraped yesterday’s ash from the clay stove, and set rice to boil. She worked in the fields when the household needed hands—pulling weeds, scattering manure, carrying sheaves at harvest.

In 1901, when she was twenty, a quarrel broke out in the kitchen. She had salted the lentils the way her mother taught her, and her mother-in-law, Shirin Bibi, demanded it be redone. Momena answered sharply, then went back to the pot without moving. Jalal heard the shouting and came in angry from the yard. He struck her with his hands and then with a thin stick used for herding. Bruises rose across her arms and back. She left the compound that afternoon and walked to Amina’s courtyard, where she stayed for several days, washing her own clothes and sleeping on a rolled mat. Jalal came for her, speaking in a low voice, and she returned without a public scene.

Children came quickly and died quickly. A daughter was born in 1900 and died in 1901, small and feverish. A son was born in 1902 and died the same day. Another daughter came in 1903 and did not live long enough to be carried outside. In 1905 she bore a son who lived long enough to walk unsteadily through the yard. In 1907, after days of diarrhea and vomiting, he died, and Momena spent that week washing cloths and boiling water until there was no more strength in her arms.

After each death she went with older women to the shrine by the path, where people left offerings for a pir whose name was spoken with respect. She did not argue about it or describe what she believed. She performed the actions she was told: a vow, a small gift, a visit at a fixed day. When she felt afraid she did not talk. She checked the baby’s chest again and again with the back of her fingers.

In 1908 she gave birth to a daughter, Anjuman, who lived. Momena carried her on her hip while she weeded the jute patch, and she laughed once when Amina called the child “little magistrate” for her serious stare. In 1912 another daughter, Jamuna, was born and lived. Momena’s small pleasures settled into routine: hot rice with mashed mustard greens, the first mangoes of early summer, and sitting on the packed earth by the granary at dusk, separating seed grain from broken kernels.

In 1911, during the aman harvest, someone cut several sheaves from the field-edge plot overnight. The bundles lay uneven where they had been lifted, and the stubble showed the sickle marks. The same night a chicken disappeared from the homestead yard. Momena noticed the missing sheaves first because she had counted the bundles as they were stacked and tied. She confronted the field watchman’s wife in the lane, voice flat and accusing. The woman shouted back, and older men had to step between them. The household did not recover the grain. That year the stores ran low before the next harvest.

During the war years, prices jumped in the markets and salt cost more. Jalal complained about rent demands and the landlord’s men who came to count and record. Momena could not follow the talk about prices or debt calculations. She watched what mattered to her: how much rice remained in the bin, how often oil was used, whether the children’s clothes had patches.

In 1916 she bore another daughter who died the day she was born. After that, there were no more children. Anjuman grew into a working girl, helping with husking and carrying water. Jamuna followed her, smaller, quick with her hands.

In 1923 the monsoon came hard. The river rose and ate the edge of the settlement. The mud walls of their dwelling softened and cracked. Water stood in the fields and ruined the aman crop. The household moved within the region to higher ground tied to a new tenancy, carrying pots, mats, and seed grain in bundles. To get through the hungry season, Jalal went to Hafiz Uddin, a mahajan, for grain loans. The terms were spoken fast. Momena could not track the measures, and she watched Jalal press his thumb to the paper. They pledged their small tenancy rights until the loan was paid. In the months after, Momena stretched meals with watery rice and wild greens, and she insisted on measuring every handful the same way.

Jalal’s health broke in the mid-1920s. He coughed through nights and stopped taking full turns in the field. In 1927 he died, leaving Momena a widow in her forties. She stayed in a stem-family household, attached to the line of her husband’s kin and the labor of the younger adults. Anjuman married out to another village, visiting when she could. Jamuna married nearer and came often with small gifts of dried fish or a handful of lentils.

By 1929, Shirin Bibi and Kader Miah, her parents-in-law, became frail. Momena took over their care. She cooked soft rice and thin gruel, bathed them with warmed water, and cleaned their bedding. She carried their spittle cloths to the pond and washed them separate from the children’s clothes. She still went to the fields for transplanting and weeding, her sari hem muddy by midmorning, then returned to feed the elders before the rest of the household ate.

In the early 1930s, with crop prices falling and credit tightening, the household watched every purchase. Momena argued over waste. She snapped at a young in-law for spilling rice. She refused to flatter the landlord’s agent and handed over rent in exact measures, no more.

By 1934 she carried a hard pain low in her body and began to bleed at odd times. She kept working, slower, stopping to sit on the ground with her back against a post. In January 1935 the pain became constant. On January 19, 1935, Momena Bibi died in the rural household where she had spent her widowhood, with her daughters and in-laws in the compound and the winter air cool outside.
