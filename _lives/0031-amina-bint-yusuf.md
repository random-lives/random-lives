Amina bint Yusuf was born on November 16, 1282, in a small Mudéjar hamlet among the low hills of Camp de Túria, in the Kingdom of Valencia under the Crown of Aragon. Christian officials ruled the district from nearby towns, but her family prayed in Arabic at home and took their disputes and taxes to Christian courts when they had to.

Her father, Yusuf, worked rented strips of dry farmland and kept goats and a few sheep. At dawn he took the animals out with a crook and a small bag of feed, then walked his boundary lines and checked the grain. In the yard her mother milked, strained, and salted. She set curds to drain in cloth and kept a pot for whey near the hearth. The house held more than the couple and their child. Yusuf’s widowed sister, Zaynab, lived with them and did the grinding when her hands allowed it, and watched the baby when the mother carried milk or water.

Amina had no older siblings. She slept in a cradle near the women’s work. They spoke Andalusi Arabic to her. Yusuf used short phrases of the local Romance in the market and when a steward came for dues.

In May 1285, after a day of heat and dust, Amina began passing watery stool. Her mother gave her water and thin porridge. The child vomited it back. By the second day her mouth stayed dry and her skin cooled. She died on May 21, 1285. Her family washed her, wrapped her, and buried her outside the village.
