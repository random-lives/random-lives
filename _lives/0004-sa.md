# Debug information (not displayed on page):
# Age at death: 40
# Agreeableness (% rank): 71
# Birth date: June 24, 65012 BC
# Birth year: 65012 BC
# Climate now: Today the Mopti–Djenné Inland Niger Delta is a Sahelian environment with
#   a short rainy season and a long dry season. It remains a major seasonal floodplain,
#   but rainfall is low and variable and the system is sensitive to droughts, upstream
#   water use, and warming.
# Climate then: Around 65,000 BC the region was within the late Pleistocene and likely
#   experienced generally drier conditions than the later African Humid Period, with
#   stronger aridity pulses associated with glacial-stage climate variability. Even
#   so, the Niger’s headwaters in wetter highlands would still have driven seasonal
#   flooding, creating a dependable ribbon of wetlands and resources amid otherwise
#   more open, dry savanna-steppe landscapes.
# Conscientiousness (% rank): 72
# Cultural tradition: undifferentiated
# Death date: January 12, 64971 BC
# Environment: 'A vast seasonal wetland centered on the Niger and Bani rivers: broad
#   floodplains, shallow lakes, marshes, and river channels that expand in the annual
#   flood and shrink to pools and mudflats in the dry season. Vegetation would be a
#   mosaic of grasses, sedges, riparian woodland, and open savanna, supporting abundant
#   fish, waterbirds, and large grazing and browsing mammals along the floodplain margins.'

# narrative_plan:
#   children: []
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 15
#     connection: Occurs during a flood-season aggregation; reinforces her later preference
#       for same-sex partnership and informs how discreetly she navigates group expectations
#       (low openness + conscientiousness).
#     incident: premarital_sex
#   - age: 29
#     connection: Resource shortfall (late flood, weak fish run) creates a coordination
#       problem; Sa’s reliability and fairness let her organize labor-sharing without
#       provoking conflict, directly leading to her 'respected/influential' standing.
#     incident: major_achievement
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6
#     key_events:
#     - Grows up in a small floodplain camp; learns routines of carrying water, watching
#       younger kin, and staying near safe channels during the flood season.
#     - Family story of the infant sister’s death is retold as a warning about sickness
#       and bad water; Sa is taught careful, rule-based habits early.
#     - Begins helping with simple processing tasks (sorting shellfish, turning strips
#       of drying fish) under her mother and eldest sister’s supervision.
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 7-17
#     key_events:
#     - 'Becomes known as steady and reliable: arrives on time for group moves, keeps
#       tools bundled, and finishes tedious work without complaint.'
#     - Attends seasonal flood aggregations where multiple camps meet; learns etiquette
#       and dispute-avoidance from older women.
#     - Experiences first romantic/sexual attachment to another girl during an aggregation,
#       keeping it discreet but not secretive.
#     phase: Later childhood / adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-27
#     key_events:
#     - Takes on more logistical tasks in camp moves (packing, checking stores, coordinating
#       who carries what), building a reputation for competence.
#     - Forms an increasingly stable partnership with Kali, sharing daily work and sleeping
#       area; receives mixed reactions but overall tolerance due to her helpfulness.
#     - Develops influence through calm, practical advice rather than charisma—often
#       asked to weigh in when others argue over where to camp or when to move.
#     phase: Young adulthood
#   - age_range: 28-36
#     key_events:
#     - During a late-flood year, coordinates a rotation between drying fish at shrinking
#       pools and digging edible wetland tubers; several households avoid hunger.
#     - 'Her standing rises: people seek her judgment in resource-sharing disputes,
#       and she speaks more in group decisions without dominating.'
#     - Continues a childless household with Kali, investing time in nieces/nephews
#       and in helping her aging parents.
#     phase: Prime adulthood
#   - age_range: 37-40
#     key_events:
#     - Endures repeated bouts of fever in a bad season; still pushes herself to contribute
#       small tasks (mending, sorting, keeping fires).
#     - A severe infectious illness spreads through camp; she deteriorates over days
#       and dies during the dry-season period when water sources are most constrained.
#     - Her eldest sister and partner manage mourning rites and redistribute her tools/containers
#       to close kin.

#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: -65013
#     narrative_role: Infant sister who dies shortly after birth; her death shapes family
#       caution around water/illness and strengthens reliance on the eldest sister and
#       extended kin.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: She is seen as cautious and practical; sometimes slows risky innovation,
#       but reduces avoidable losses and builds trust in her judgment.
#     scene: When others propose experimenting with a distant, unfamiliar channel, Sa
#       argues for the proven seasonal route and insists on known camps with reliable
#       reeds, fuelwood, and safe crossings.
#     timing: Young adulthood (18-27), repeated into prime adulthood
#     trait: Low Openness (12th percentile)
#   - consequence: Becomes a go-to organizer during stressful shortages; contributes
#       to her later major achievement and respected status.
#     scene: Before a move, she re-checks that drying racks are emptied, embers are
#       safely buried, and each household has packed core tools; she notices missing
#       awls/points and prevents losses.
#     timing: Adolescence into adulthood (12-36)
#     trait: High Conscientiousness (72nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Increases social cohesion; others invite her into conflict resolution,
#       reinforcing her influence.
#     scene: In a tense dispute over who gets first access to a productive pool, she
#       proposes a turn-taking rule and frames it as protecting children and elders,
#       calming tempers.
#     timing: Prime adulthood (28-36)
#     trait: High Agreeableness (71st percentile)
#   - consequence: Others rely on her steadiness during crises; she may underplay her
#       own symptoms, contributing to late rest and vulnerability during her terminal
#       infection.
#     scene: During fever seasons and tense encounters with neighboring groups, she
#       stays outwardly calm, speaks slowly, and focuses on immediate tasks rather than
#       spiraling into panic.
#     timing: Across adulthood; highlighted in final years (37-40)
#     trait: Low Neuroticism (23rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Her influence comes from diligence and fairness rather than clever
#       innovation; she pairs well with more inventive allies while maintaining credibility.
#     scene: She excels at routine, learned procedures but struggles with novel problem-solving
#       (e.g., quickly reading complex social maneuvering or inventing new gear), often
#       deferring to a sharper peer for tricky planning details.
#     timing: Adolescence and young adulthood (13-27)
#     trait: Lower-than-average Intelligence (34th percentile)
# number_of_children: '0'

# - 76
# - 0
# sibling_sexes:
# - F
# - F
# social_standing: respected/influential
# special_skills: generalist
# structured_incidents:
# - event: During a year when the flood came late and fish runs were thin, she organized
#     a small group to rotate between drying fish at shrinking pools and collecting
#     edible wetland tubers, helping several households avoid hunger and earning a reputation
#     as someone people listened to in camp decisions.
#   reasoning: Being described as respected/influential suggests some recognized social
#     success (trusted mediator, organizer, or valued contributor), though most recognition
#     in bands is informal rather than exceptional.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 28–30 (late dry season into the first floods)
#   type: major_achievement
# - event: As a teenager she had a brief, consensual sexual relationship with an older
#     girl from a neighboring camp during seasonal gatherings on the floodplain before
#     either of them entered a publicly acknowledged partnership.
#   reasoning: In many hunter-gatherer contexts, adolescent/young-adult sexual activity
#     can occur prior to any socially recognized long-term pair-bond; her same-sex orientation/partnership
#     makes early, less-formal relationships plausible.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 15–16 (during the annual flood-season aggregation)
#   type: premarital_sex

Sa was born in 65011 BC on a strip of higher ground above the Inland Niger Delta floodplain, where the Niger and Bani spread into shallow lakes and reed beds before shrinking back into channels. No wider authority governed the camps that used this place. Decisions came from talk beside the fires, from kin ties, and from the pull of dependable water when the dry season tightened.

Her parents stayed together through her childhood and moved with the same cluster of relatives and affines year after year, cutting across the edge of marsh and open savanna. Sa arrived as the third child. Her oldest sister, Noma, already walked and carried small bundles. The middle sister was born two years before Sa and died the same day she was born. Sa grew up with that loss treated as a rule: keep infants shaded, don’t drink from the first scummed pools after the waters pulled back, don’t linger where the air hung thick with biting insects at dusk.

Sa’s earliest memories stayed close to the hearth. She watched fish split along the belly and opened flat, watched strips set over racks and turned. She learned to keep twine dry and sinew wrapped, and to put stone points where feet would not find them in the dark. When she was small she followed Noma, who took charge of her in the mornings while their mother worked. Noma liked a quick pace and made Sa keep up. If Sa dragged, Noma flicked her shoulder and told her to look at the ground in front of her, not at the birds.

By age seven, Sa carried water in a skin bag and kept it from sloshing out. She avoided the deeper channels and walked the same path each time, even when others cut across soft mud to save steps. She liked doing tasks that ended cleanly: a finished bundle, a tied knot, a neat pile of fuelwood. When the camp prepared to move, she counted the digging sticks and the baskets and checked them again. Other children ran down to the edge to watch hippos and crocs in the distance. Sa stayed where she could see the adults and hear what they said.

Each year, when the flood spread wide and fish moved through new channels, scattered camps met on the higher levees. There were exchanges of shell beads and dried meat and news about who had quarreled and who had died. In 64996 BC, when Sa was fifteen, she joined the adolescent girls who slept at the edge of the gathering camp, away from the older people’s talk. A girl named Tiri came with a neighboring camp from a different reach of the floodplain. Tiri was older by a few years, already strong in the arms from hauling baskets of wet sedge roots. Sa followed her to the far end of the reed line one afternoon and they lay together on dry grass under the trees. After that they found each other at dusk for several nights until the camps broke apart and each group returned to its own channels. Sa did not speak about it to her parents. Noma saw enough to understand and said nothing. She only warned Sa not to start fights over it.

As Sa grew into her twenties, she did more of the unglamorous work that kept a camp working: packing and unpacking, keeping tools dry, checking embers before leaving a fire spot. She had a habit of sitting just outside the sleeping area before dawn, picking grit out of the edge of a basket weave and listening for what people were saying. When someone planned a move to a distant channel, she pushed for the familiar routes. She had no patience for new shortcuts through unknown brush. Once, a young man insisted on cutting straight across a marshy corner to reach a pool first. Sa refused to go. He sank thigh-deep and lost a stone point in the mud. She collected his other gear and handed it back without comment.

Sa liked roasted fish skin crisped on hot stones. She took pride in making it evenly browned, not scorched. When children begged for scraps, she cut them narrow strips and made them wait until the adults had eaten. It annoyed her when people chewed plant fibers and left the spittle wads near the sleeping places. She walked them to the edge and flicked them into the wet with a stick, scolding in a flat voice.

In 64986 BC, when Sa was twenty-five, she drew close to Kali, a woman from her own camp cluster who laughed easily and made other women roll their eyes with her teasing. Kali liked to sit where she could watch the path into camp and call out greetings before anyone else noticed arrivals. Sa found that useful. Kali asked questions that Sa did not think of asking. Sa remembered the answers and acted on them. They began sleeping together, then sharing a cooking place, then working as a pair without needing to say so aloud. Kali’s joking made it easier when someone made a remark about two women keeping a hearth together. Sa did not argue. She just kept bringing in food and finishing tasks.

In 64982 BC, Sa’s father cut his foot on a sharp flake while shaping wood. The wound swelled, and he could not walk far. Sa took on more hauling and more careful packing, then sat beside him in the evenings picking apart the scabbed edges and washing it with warmed water and crushed leaves. She stayed calm and direct, and she expected him to do what she told him. When he tried to stand too soon, she pushed him back down by the shoulder.

The late flood year came in 64982 BC. The rains in the upstream highlands did not send water on time. Channels narrowed early, and the fish runs were weak. People argued about where to camp and who should get the first catch from a shrinking pool. Sa stopped the shouting by setting a simple schedule. Each morning she sent one small group to tend drying racks and watch the last fish trapped in the shallows. Another group went with digging sticks to the wettest pockets for tubers and sedge roots. At midday the groups switched. Sa kept track with notches on a stick and made sure elders and children ate first. Kali backed her up, using humor when tempers flared and sharp words were ready. By the time the first real floodwater arrived, several households had stored enough dried fish and roots to avoid scattering into desperate foraging. After that season, people waited for Sa to speak before making final choices about moves.

In the years that followed, Sa and Kali stayed childless and tied themselves more tightly to kin. Noma had children and Sa carried the smallest on her hip during moves, keeping their heads shaded with a scrap of hide. She taught older nieces how to clean fish without nicking their hands and how to stack firewood so it stayed dry through a night wind. She did not tell long stories, but she listened well, and when disputes started—over a lost basket, over who owed meat to whom—she made the talk return to facts and to a workable rule.

By 64974 BC, Sa began having bouts of fever that left her sweating and unsteady for a day or two, then back on her feet. She still checked bundles before moves. She still insisted on the known routes. Kali complained that Sa treated her own body the way she treated tools, as if pushing it harder would keep it from breaking.

In early 64971 BC, at the height of the dry season, several people in the camp fell ill after drinking from a shallow pool that had turned green at the edges. Sa’s sickness came fast. She vomited, could not keep down water, and stopped rising from her sleeping place. Kali and Noma tried to get liquid into her with a reed, drop by drop, and wiped her skin with cool wet grass. Sa died on January 12, 64971 BC. Kali and Noma carried her to firm ground above the floodplain and covered her with reeds and packed earth, then returned to camp before night.
