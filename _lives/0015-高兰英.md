高兰英 was born on August 15, 1758, in Zhouzhuang on the level farmland of the North China plain. Her family were Han villagers under the Qing, tenants on a landlord’s fields. Her father rose before dawn to yoke the animal and work the rented strips, then went to the landlord’s agent to settle rent and seed. He came home tight-lipped and kept his accounts close.

Her mother ran the courtyard and the stove. She cooked millet and wheat cakes, hauled water, fed chickens, and spun thread in the gaps between tasks. When fieldwork pressed, she went out to weed and carry bundles, then returned to wash and mend by lamplight.

The household was parents and children in two crowded rooms. Four siblings moved around the kang and the workbench. The oldest girl took orders, quick to scold and quicker to grab what she wanted. Lan’ying cried easily and was quieted with a finger of warm gruel or a strip of cloth to suck.

At new year and on festival days her mother set a small bowl of food at the household altar and burned incense, speaking the ancestors’ names in a low voice. When the village went to the temple fair, her mother carried Lan’ying on her hip through the press of people, lifted the child’s hand to touch the incense once, then wiped the ash off on her own sleeve and moved on.

Lan’ying was weaned early when her mother’s belly began to swell again and the family needed grain for those who could work. In late winter of 1760, with cold wind pushing through the door cracks, she began to pass watery stool again and again. Her mother boiled water, thinned rice into gruel, and gave her bitter herbs from the market. Lan’ying drank and emptied out.

By the first days of March she had no strength to sit. Her skin went cool and her mouth dried. On March 4, 1760, she stopped crying and lay still on the kang while her mother kept a hand on her abdomen, then called for her husband when the child did not breathe back.
