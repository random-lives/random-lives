#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds a wide network of reciprocal favors; this helps after bad
#       seasons, but also makes her more exposed to camp politics and disputes.
#     scene: At seasonal encampments she moves easily between tents, trading gossip
#       and practical help; she volunteers to coordinate shared milking times and to
#       host visiting ritual specialists with tea/butter offerings.
#     timing: Later childhood through adulthood (ages 8-21)
#     trait: Extraversion (66th percentile)
#   - consequence: Others rely on her in crises; she may appear emotionally cool, which
#       occasionally causes friction with more visibly grieving relatives.
#     scene: During severe winter strain and later her mother’s death, she shows steady
#       focus—keeps butter stores organized, continues offerings, and does not panic
#       during storms, even when others do.
#     timing: Adolescence (15-16) and young adulthood (18)
#     trait: Low Neuroticism (15th percentile)
#   - consequence: Creates intermittent household tension; however, it also helps her
#       resist being pushed into unfair labor expectations.
#     scene: She is quick to snap back when criticized and will challenge older women’s
#       judgments about her work pace; with her husband she argues directly about camp
#       placement and animal allocation instead of yielding.
#     timing: Adolescence into adulthood (14-21)
#     trait: Lower Agreeableness (37th percentile)
#   - consequence: Earns teasing/scolding from Yangchen; she learns practical coping
#       (pairing tasks with companions, doing work socially) to stay on track.
#     scene: She sometimes cuts corners—leaves wool sorting until later or takes an
#       extra rest when she thinks no one is watching—then works hard in bursts to catch
#       up.
#     timing: Later childhood and adolescence (10-16)
#     trait: Lower Conscientiousness (40th percentile)
#   - consequence: Occasional disputes, but within normal bounds; her social skill often
#       smooths over minor resentments.
#     scene: In barter situations she pushes for better terms and is not above small
#       self-serving choices (keeping the better hide strip, claiming she did more of
#       a shared task) unless directly confronted.
#     timing: Adolescence and adulthood (13-21)
#     trait: Lower Honesty-Humility (38th percentile)
#   - consequence: Competent daily worker; not positioned for roles requiring literacy
#       or formal religious expertise.
#     scene: Learns routines by repetition rather than abstraction; strong at hands-on
#       skills (butter texture, judging weather signs) yet less confident with complex
#       negotiations, so she leans on Palden in disputes.
#     timing: Childhood through adulthood
#     trait: Intelligence (44th percentile) / average practical reasoning
# number_of_children: '0'

# occupation: Pastoral household worker (dairy processing, cooking/fuel-water collection,

Peldzom was born on May 16, 1034, in a black-tent encampment on the high alpine steppe of the central Tibetan Plateau, where families moved between grazing grounds with yak, sheep, and goats. The area lay under local rulers and monastic networks rather than a distant court, and people spoke a Tibetic vernacular and kept household practice that mixed old land-spirit duties with simple Buddhist devotions. Her family made smoke offerings on a low stone hearth outside the tent, feeding juniper and dried dung to the fire so the smoke carried butter and flour scents up toward the mountain and pasture spirits. When a monk or ritual specialist came through, her grandmother added a few recited lines and a muttered mani under her breath.

She was the sixth child in a long sequence of births. The oldest girl, Drolma, died at eight in the same year Peldzom arrived; adults spoke of that loss with the flat tone used for things that could not be argued with. A brother named Tashi had lived only long enough to be wrapped once; Sonam died at three before Peldzom formed memories. What remained to her as she grew were the living ones: Palden, an older brother who could keep a herd together in wind and thin light; and Yangchen, the sister just older than her, quick with a joke and quicker with criticism.

The household was crowded. Her father Norbu and her mother Sangmo held authority in different ways. Norbu decided when to move camp and how to split animals between pastures. Sangmo ran the inside of the tent: the hanging bags of dried cheese, the wooden churn, the careful separation of clean and dirty vessels, the patching of felt and hide. Peldzom learned early that talk mattered. A complaint in the wrong ear turned into extra work. A shared laugh made someone carry a load that had been meant for you.

By the time she could walk steadily on uneven ground, she followed Yangchen outside in the cold mornings to bring dung fuel to the hearth. Yangchen liked to make Peldzom guess which pile had frozen hard enough to lift without crumbling. If she guessed wrong, Yangchen tapped her shoulder with the collecting stick and laughed. Peldzom laughed back and then argued about the rules of the game until Yangchen told her to stop talking and pick up the dung.

In the winter of 1038, her baby sister Lhamo was born and died within days. The adults hung an extra strip of cloth and a knotted cord near the sleeping place after that. Late the next year, Dechen lived long enough for Peldzom to hold her while Sangmo worked the churn. Dechen’s death in 1039 stayed with Peldzom in details: the way the tent felt too warm with extra bodies inside, the sour smell of old butter used for lamplight, and her grandmother Ani Deki’s hands rubbing a little butter into Dechen’s forehead before wrapping her.

In 1041 another brother, Yeshe, was born and died within a day. Sangmo barely spoke of it, but Peldzom saw how she held her hands together in her lap the morning after and would not look at the place where the tiny wrapped bundle had lain.

At six, Peldzom already had chores that mattered. She watched the smaller animals that grazed close to camp and learned to recognize which goats would bolt at a sudden noise. Norbu sometimes let her carry a short rope and showed her how to turn a straying animal with a sharp step and a louder voice. She enjoyed the parts of the day when neighbors’ tents were near and there were errands between households—returning a wooden bowl, asking for a coal, bringing news that a herd had crossed a stream safely. She talked too much for Yangchen’s patience and kept talking anyway, smiling when she was told to shut up.

Apo Dorje, her paternal grandfather, sat near the entrance and enforced small rules. He made children greet elders properly and scolded Peldzom when she barged in with wet boots. She resisted him in small ways—rolling her eyes when she thought he wouldn’t see, taking the better piece of dried meat when serving herself. He saw. He scolded. She did it again when she thought she could get away with it. In 1046 he died after a short illness, and the household’s center of gravity shifted. Palden took on more weight in decisions, and Norbu listened to him without the old man’s interruptions.

In 1047 a sickness moved through the sheep and goats. Animals coughed, stood with heads lowered, and some went off their feed. Norbu and Palden changed where they grazed and kept the weakest animals closer to camp so they could be watched. An itinerant ritual specialist named Lobsang arrived with a few other men, accepted butter tea, and conducted a protection rite with offerings laid out on a felt cloth—barley flour, butter, and a small bowl of beer. Peldzom helped by fetching water and holding restless animals while Sangmo and Yangchen cleaned vessels and made extra cheese when milk began to return. Peldzom talked to Lobsang when she could, asking questions about what he carried in his pouch and why he tied certain knots. Yangchen yanked her sleeve and told her not to bother him.

The winter of 1049 came hard, and by midwinter in 1050 Ani Deki could not rise easily. Peldzom learned how her grandmother kept the household’s small shrine: a neat corner with a lamp, a few images, and a place for offerings. Peldzom replaced the wick, pressed butter into a small bowl, and set out a pinch of flour. She did it with steady hands. When Ani Deki died in 1050, Peldzom argued with Yangchen about how much butter could be spared for offerings in a lean season. Yangchen called her selfish; Peldzom said Yangchen liked to play the saint. Sangmo stopped the fight by assigning them each a task and saying nothing else.

Marriage negotiations came in 1051. Palden spoke to a nearby encampment, and a young man named Jampa became Peldzom’s husband. She moved into a separate nuclear unit—still close enough to family that visits were ordinary, but with her own pot, her own churn, and the daily need to manage without Sangmo’s constant direction. Jampa worked herds alongside other men and expected Peldzom to keep his household efficient. She liked the control of her own space and disliked being corrected by her mother-in-law, Tsering Kyid, when they camped near Jampa's family. Peldzom answered back too quickly. Tsering Kyid responded by giving her the heavier buckets and watching to see whether she complained.

Sangmo died in 1052 after an illness that left her unable to keep food down. Peldzom returned to her natal camp during that time, brought warm water and thin butter tea, and slept near the entrance so she could move quickly when called. After Sangmo’s death, Peldzom took on more than the duties of a young wife. She brought cheese to Yangchen when stores ran low and helped Palden’s household during peak milking. She did not cry in front of others; she worked, spoke plainly, and snapped when someone offered advice she had not asked for.

In 1053, during a seasonal move between grazing areas, thieves took several sheep from the edge of Peldzom and Jampa’s encampment. Morning counting revealed the missing animals, and the men searched tracks until the wind erased them. Palden pushed for compensation through a mediator, Pema Dorje, and the discussions hardened relations with a neighboring camp. At night Peldzom slept lightly, listening for animal bells, and cursed when Jampa suggested they camp farther from her family for safety. She wanted the protection of numbers and the comfort of familiar voices. Jampa wanted distance and less obligation. They argued, then worked side by side again, because animals still needed milking and wool still needed cleaning.

Peldzom took pleasure in small routines. She liked butter tea when it was strong and salty, not watered down for guests. She enjoyed the loud parts of the day when women gathered, hands busy with wool, talk bouncing between tents. Chodron from a neighbor camp made her laugh by imitating a pompous headman’s voice; Peldzom laughed loudly and then repeated the imitation once more when she knew someone important could hear. It brought her a scolding later, and she accepted it with a shrug.

In late summer 1055, after a move across open pasture, Peldzom developed a deep cough and chest pain that made milking hard. Jampa's relatives brought hot drinks and placed warmed stones near her bedding. Lobsang passed through again and performed a short rite with smoke and barley flour, and Jampa gave him butter and a strip of dried meat. The cough worsened over days. On September 7, 1055, Peldzom died in the tent, with her husband and nearby relatives present.

Her body was wrapped and carried out onto the open ground. A brief rite was performed with smoke offering and a small butter lamp, and her remains were left for a sky burial, with a few pinches of barley flour scattered and a murmured mani from the women who had worked beside her.
