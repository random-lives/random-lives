# ethnicity: Aramaean/Aramaic-speaking West Semitic (local rural communities of the
#   Upper Euphrates)
# father_occupation: Substantial farmer (rainfed cereal/olive/vine/legumes) with mixed
#   household production
# historical_context:
# - event: Neo-Assyrian consolidation and tighter provincial administration in the Upper
#     Euphrates (tributary extraction, standardized levies, requisitioning for garrisons
#     and campaigns)
#   timing: ages 0–35 (749–714 BC), intensifying into midlife
# - event: Sargon II’s western campaigns and the 717 BC fall/annexation of Carchemish,
#     likely increasing direct imperial oversight and altering local elite networks
#     and obligations
#   timing: age 32 (717 BC) and the following decade
# - event: Rainfall variability in a low-precipitation rainfed zone (periodic drought
#     years leading to poor cereal yields, higher grain prices, and heightened debt/tenancy
#     risk)
#   timing: recurring across life; especially impactful in adulthood (ages 20–70)
# - event: Euphrates and tributary flood/erosion episodes affecting fields, storage,
#     and transport (less frequent than drought but locally damaging when it occurs)
#   timing: intermittent; any decade, with highest impact during active farming years
#     (ages 20–60)
# - event: Regional livestock disease or crop pest episodes (e.g., herd illness, locust-like
#     infestations) causing short-term food and labor stress in agrarian households
#   timing: sporadic; most consequential during peak household production years (ages
#     25–60)

#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: -707
#     name: Bar-Hadad
#     narrative_role: Substantial rainfed farmer and household head in a polygynous
#       arrangement; demanding but not cruel. He expects obedience and work, and he
#       channels dealings with officials; Ben-Hadad learns to be silent and meticulous.
#       Dies when Ben-Hadad is ~41, forcing a shift in authority among brothers.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: -701
#     name: Hannatu
#     narrative_role: Primary early caregiver for Ben-Hadad; steady household manager
#       (grain grinding, baking, water/fuel). Affection is shown through provision rather
#       than words; she praises reliability and punishes waste. Dies when he is ~47.
#     role: mother (one of two wives)
#   - death_year: -690
#     name: Sillaya
#     narrative_role: Co-wife in the compound; relationship is cautious but workable.
#       She reinforces hierarchy and house rules; Ben-Hadad is not emotionally close
#       but respects her competence.
#     role: father's second wife (co-wife/stepmother figure)
#   - death_year: -742
#     name: Raqi-El
#     narrative_role: If alive at Ben-Hadad’s birth, an elder in the compound whose
#       authority sets the tone of deference; dies when Ben-Hadad is ~6, remembered
#       mainly through sayings about land and boundaries.
#     role: paternal grandfather (possible early-life presence)
#   children:
#   - birth_year: -727
#     death_age: 3
#     death_year: -724
#     name: Hadad-nuri
#     narrative_role: First child; survives toddler years then dies, likely in a fever
#       season. His death deepens Ben-Hadad’s emotional guardedness and intensifies
#       household rituals and vows.

#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: -725
#     name: El-zer

#       wife and the women of the house, while he turns to work.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: -723
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: -723
#     name: Šamaš-zer
#     narrative_role: Another neonatal loss, coinciding with years of levies and troop
#       movement; contributes to the later uxorilocal end-of-life arrangement because
#       no surviving sons remain.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: -721
#     death_age: 25
#     death_year: -696
#     name: Atar-ʿatti
#     narrative_role: Only child to reach adulthood; close bond with Ben-Hadad (she
#       is quiet, observant). She marries and has children; her death at 25 forces Ben-Hadad
#       and Yapaʿ to rely on their son-in-law and grandchildren for household continuity.
#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 21
#     connection: Begins soon after marriage; levy obligations tie the household to
#       Assyrian administration and increase stress on farm labor allocation.
#     incident: military_service
#   - age: 25
#     connection: Later levy rotation coincides with neonatal/infant losses, deepening
#       the sense that outside demands steal time from household protection and ritual.
#     incident: military_service
#   - age: 30
#     connection: Boundary/ditch dispute escalates during harvest years when manpower
#       is tight; links to his later reputation for knowing boundaries and mediating
#       (he learns the cost of confrontation).
#     incident: physical_assault
#   - age: 33
#     connection: Occurs amid campaigns around Carchemish; household hides grain/animals,
#       shaping his later insistence on conservative storage and quiet compliance with
#       levies.
#     incident: civilian_war_exposure
#   - age: 55
#     connection: Breathlessness begins after decades of dust exposure (threshing floors,
#       grain chaff) and winter smoke; drives transition from laborer to supervisor/elder.
#     incident: chronic_illness
#   - age: 67
#     connection: Night vision failure and hearing loss accelerate; makes him more dependent
#       on wife and daughter’s household, reinforcing the late-life uxorilocal arrangement.
#     incident: acquired_disability
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-7
#     key_events:
#     - Born as the 7th child into a well-off farming household near the Upper Euphrates;
#       learns early to stay out of adult conflict between co-wives and older siblings.
#     - Brother Ahi-ram dies when Ben-Hadad is ~4, imprinting a sense of fragility and
#       making him cling to routine.
#     - 'Begins small tasks: watching threshing floor edges, carrying water, and guarding
#       stored fodder under older siblings’ direction.'
#     phase: Early childhood in a polygynous compound
#   - age_range: 8-19
#     key_events:
#     - Takes on field tasks (weeding, bird-scaring, gleaning, herding small stock);
#       learns boundaries and landmarks by memory from father/grandfather sayings.
#     - Older sister El-ramat marries out; later dies at 23 when Ben-Hadad is ~13, reinforcing
#       a reserved, inward grief style.
#     - 'Increasing encounters with Assyrian demands: deliveries of grain/animals, road
#       labor, and the presence of officials and soldiers moving through the district.'
#     phase: Later childhood and adolescence under tightening Assyrian control
#   - age_range: 20-34
#     key_events:
#     - Marriage to Yapaʿ around age 19/20; household expands and responsibilities concentrate
#       as he proves reliable rather than sociable.
#     - 'Military levy years: rotates through guard/escort duties tied to imperial campaigns
#       (without becoming a career soldier).'
#     - First children are born; repeated infant loss shapes the couple’s routines (vows,
#       offerings, protective practices) and Ben-Hadad’s emotional restraint.
#     phase: 'Young adulthood: marriage, levies, and early fatherhood'
#   - age_range: 35-55
#     key_events:
#     - Brother Paqaḥ dies at 35 (when Ben-Hadad is ~33), narrowing the adult male kin
#       circle and increasing Ben-Hadad’s role in managing land and storage.
#     - After father’s death (~age 41), division/management of holdings among surviving
#       brothers; Ben-Hadad becomes known for remembering boundaries and keeping calm
#       under pressure.
#     - His adult daughter’s marriage links him to a competent son-in-law; he begins
#       to be consulted more often in disputes (proto-elder role).
#     phase: 'Midlife: inheritance, disputes, and rising local standing'
#   - age_range: 56-70
#     key_events:
#     - Develops chronic winter cough and breathlessness; shifts from heavy field work
#       to supervision of threshing/storage and adjudicating small disputes.
#     - Economic/environmental swings (dry years, pests) make storage and redistribution
#       decisions more important; his reputation grows as a cautious steward.
#     - Daughter dies at 25 (when he is ~52), reorienting the household toward supporting
#       grandchildren and maintaining the son-in-law link.
#     phase: 'Later adulthood: chronic illness, reduced labor, elder role'
#   - age_range: 71-80
#     key_events:
#     - Progressive vision/hearing loss; relies on wife and later grandchildren/son-in-law
#       to speak in meetings and markets; he still gives quiet, conservative judgments.
#     - 'Household becomes uxorilocal/mixed: he and Yapaʿ are supported by daughter’s
#       widower and grandchildren (or by the married couple formed from that line) in
#       the same compound.'
#     - Dies suddenly of a stroke at 80 after an evening meal during a hot season.
#     phase: 'Old age: sensory decline, dependence, and death by stroke'

#   - birth_year: -746
#     death_age: 3
#     death_year: -743
#     name: Hamat-šalim
#     narrative_role: Younger sister who dies in toddlerhood; another early household
#       loss that makes him wary and emotionally restrained.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: He is overlooked for flashy opportunities but trusted for quiet reliability;
#       others take the lead in negotiations, while he becomes the 'memory of boundaries'
#       and a behind-the-scenes decision maker.
#     scene: At village gatherings he stands at the edge, speaks only when asked, and
#       prefers communicating through a brother or later through his wife/son-in-law;
#       he avoids drinking circles and public boasting.
#     timing: most visible from adolescence through midlife (ages 12-55)
#     trait: Extraversion (1st percentile) very low
#   - consequence: Stability and fewer catastrophic gambles, but slower adaptation in
#       drought/pest years; younger kin sometimes push changes around him.
#     scene: He resists experimenting with new sowing times or unfamiliar crop mixes
#       even after officials and travelers mention alternatives; he sticks to inherited
#       practices and omens/seasonal routines.
#     timing: adulthood, especially after inheritance (ages 40-70)
#     trait: Openness (2nd percentile) very low
#   - consequence: Dependence on trusted intermediaries; increases the importance of
#       kin trust and his reputation for honesty in managing communal stores.
#     scene: When Aramaic administrative habits spread (seals, written tallies), he
#       keeps accounts by memory and physical measures (sealed jars, counted sheaves)
#       rather than learning marks, relying on others for any written dealings.
#     timing: midlife onward (ages 35-70)
#     trait: Low openness + low extraversion combined (social and cognitive conservatism)
# number_of_children: '4'
# number_of_siblings: '7'
# occupation: Rainfed cereal farmer (barley/wheat) with some legumes; household-based
#   cultivation as primary identity

#     during harvest season.'
#   reasoning: Rural disputes, robbery, raids, and fights (including during wartime)
#     make at least one non-domestic assault the most plausible way he experienced violence.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 28–35 (c. 721–714 BC)
#   type: physical_assault
# - event: 'Sustained period: from late middle age he developed a chronic cough and
#     breathlessness that flared in winter, limiting heavy field labor and shifting
#     him toward supervision and storage/accounting-by-memory rather than daily plowing.'
#   reasoning: Surviving to 80 in this setting strongly implies periods of chronic limitation
#     (joint degeneration, recurrent infection, cardiopulmonary weakness) before the
#     terminal stroke.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 52–70 (c. 697–679 BC)
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: 'Sustained period: he gradually lost vision (especially at dusk) and some
#     hearing, making it hard to recognize faces at distance and to follow group discussions,
#     so family members often spoke for him in markets and village meetings.'
#   reasoning: Age-related vision/hearing loss or mobility impairment from injury/arthritis
#     was common among elders; living to 80 makes some lasting disability fairly likely.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 65–80 (c. 684–668 BC)
#   type: acquired_disability
# - event: 'Sustained period: as a landholding adult man he was levied for local militia
#     duty attached to Assyrian campaigns and garrison needs—guarding grain stores and
#     roads, escorting officials, and mustering with other villagers when troops moved
#     through the Carchemish district.'
#   reasoning: Men could be levied for militia duty or corvée-connected military tasks;
#     as a local notable he may have organized or joined defense, though low extraversion
#     slightly lowers the chance.
#   tier: 2

#   type: military_service
# - event: 'Single event: an imperial campaign and counter-raids swept the Upper Euphrates

#     and keep children indoors for days.'
#   reasoning: Northern Syria in this era experienced campaigns, garrisons, requisitioning,
#     and occasional raids; even without migrating he could experience occupation/requisition
#     events as a civilian.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 33–34 (c. 716–715 BC)
#   type: civilian_war_exposure
---

Ben-Hadad was born into an Aramaic-speaking farming compound on the Upper Euphrates, where Assyrian power set the terms of taxes, labor, and security. His household prayed and offered food at home, calling on Hadad for rain and El for protection, and went to local shrines at festival times when the roads felt safe.

His father, Bar-Hadad, held rainfed fields that rose away from the river and a few small orchards near reliable moisture. Two wives kept the compound running. Ben-Hadad’s mother, Hannatu, ran the milling and baking in a steady routine: grind at dawn, bake when the hearth was hot, carry water before the sun climbed. A co-wife, Sillaya, managed her own children and stores. The women’s voices carried across the courtyard in the mornings, instructions and corrections more than affection. Ben-Hadad learned early to do what he was told and to move quietly.

He was the seventh child. The firstborn brother, Hadad-ram, and a sister, Tob-il, died at birth. Another brother, Ahi-ram, lived long enough to run beside him and throw clods into the ditch water; Ahi-ram died when Ben-Hadad was four. The household did not speak much over the small body. A younger sister, Hamat-šalim, was born when Ben-Hadad was two and died at three—old enough that he remembered her face but not her voice. Hannatu’s work did not stop. She laid bread and a cup of beer near the household place of offering and pressed ash onto the threshold. Ben-Hadad watched without questions.

An older sister, El-ramat, mattered most in his early memory. She lifted him onto her hip when Hannatu’s hands were full of dough, and she taught him how to keep chickens out of the stored barley by throwing pebbles, not chasing. When El-ramat married out, she visited once with a baby on her shoulder. Soon after, news came that she died at twenty-three. Bar-Hadad received the message and went back to measuring seed.

Ben-Hadad grew tall early and moved with a careful gait. He took chores that kept him away from noisy groups. He liked guarding the threshing floor edge where the wind took the chaff, and he liked the evening meal most when it was thick lentil stew with onions and a little sour beer. When other boys began to show off with slings, he practiced alone behind the grain bins and stopped when someone approached.

Assyrian demands sharpened as he entered adolescence. Officials and armed escorts came down the track, and the village provided fodder, bread, and men for road work. Bar-Hadad did the talking. Ben-Hadad watched his father’s face and learned when to keep his eyes down. He carried sacks when told, counted sheaves when told, and did not join in the disputes at the edge of meetings.

At nineteen he married Yapaʿ, a woman from a neighboring family, in a match set by their fathers. She brought her own grinding stone and a small chest of cloth. Their marriage stayed quiet. They argued over stores the way other couples argued over insults: whether to open a sealed jar in spring, how much barley to set aside for seed. In the evenings he enjoyed sitting near the doorway where he could feel the shift of air and listen to the courtyard without stepping into it.

At twenty-one the levy reached him. He left the fields in rotation with other men and took up militia duty tied to Assyrian campaigns and garrison needs. He guarded grain stores, stood watch at road points, and walked with a small group escorting officials who came to assess livestock and collect grain. He followed orders and did not volunteer for talk. In camp he ate when told and slept when told. The older men teased him for using few words; he answered with a brief nod that did not invite more.

Children came fast and died fast. Hadad-nuri lived three years, long enough to toddle into the courtyard and tug at Ben-Hadad’s belt. A fever took the boy in his third year, and Ben-Hadad marked the doorway with ash again and poured beer at the household offering place. The next son, El-zer, died at birth. Two years later Šamaš-zer died the same way, a brief cry and then silence. Yapaʿ grew thinner after each loss; she returned to grinding and baking with her jaw tight and her eyes fixed on the grain. Ben-Hadad carried water more often.

At twenty-seven their daughter Atar-ʿatti was born and survived. Ben-Hadad watched her with an attention he did not show the infants. He taught her where to step on the threshing floor so the packed earth would not break, and he let her sit beside him while he checked jar seals. She learned to speak softly, and he preferred that.

At thirty a dispute over field boundaries and ditch rights turned into a beating. It happened at harvest when tempers rose and men counted what each plot would yield. A man from a neighboring hamlet, Karanu, came with others, insisting a ditch line belonged to them. Ben-Hadad answered with short phrases. When he refused to move a boundary marker, fists came. Someone struck him from the side. He fell, took kicks, and stood again. He returned home with bruises and a cracked rib that hurt whenever he breathed deep. He did not pursue a blood feud. He went back to the same fields with a staff in hand and placed stones where his father said they belonged.

War reached their doorstep in his thirty-third year. An imperial campaign and counter-raids swept the corridor. Smoke rose beyond the river bends. Men ran through the village with news that animals were being taken and grain stores searched. Ben-Hadad and Bar-Hadad hid jars and sacks under chaff and moved goats into a covered pen inside the compound. For days the children stayed close and quiet. When soldiers passed, they requisitioned barley and took two animals without bargaining. Afterward Ben-Hadad sealed jars with extra care and insisted that grain be spread across more storage pits instead of kept in one place.

His brother Paqaḥ died at thirty-five, in the same season when people watched the roads more than the sky. The loss tightened the household’s adult labor. When Bar-Hadad died a few years later, Ben-Hadad was forty-one and already managing much of the storage and field pacing. His oldest surviving brother, Zakkur, did the bargaining and spoke to the levy collectors. Ben-Hadad kept the measures straight and remembered the old boundary stones. He sat through meetings without interrupting, then spoke once at the end, a few sentences that settled what needed settling.

An older village elder, Ṣillaya son of Mati-El, had watched him during those meetings. Ṣillaya handled disputes the same way: wait, listen, speak last. He showed Ben-Hadad how to keep offerings when a field changed hands and how to mark a boundary with witnesses who would remember. Ben-Hadad never sought him out for talk, but he paid attention when the old man was present.

Hannatu died when Ben-Hadad was forty-seven. She had grown slower in her final years, rising later each morning. The household offerings continued without her; Yapaʿ took over the dawn grinding.

Atar-ʿatti married Yamlik, a competent man who worked steadily and did not waste words. Ben-Hadad accepted him. He and Yamlik could sit a long time over a jar of beer without turning it into a contest. Yamlik made one joke that Ben-Hadad repeated twice over the next year: that a man should argue with weeds, not with neighbors. Ben-Hadad gave a brief laugh each time, more through his nose than his mouth.

Zakkur died at fifty-five, when Ben-Hadad was fifty-one. The brother who had done the talking and bargaining was gone. Ben-Hadad did not take over that role; Yamlik stepped into it, while Ben-Hadad continued keeping the boundaries straight.

That same year a traveler who had passed through Carchemish mentioned that farmers down the corridor were sowing earlier and trying a different mix of barley and emmer. Yamlik brought the idea to Ben-Hadad. He listened, then shook his head. His father had sown at the same time his grandfather had. He saw no reason to change.

The next year Atar-ʿatti died at twenty-five. Her children remained, and Ben-Hadad and Yapaʿ fed them and set them to small tasks. Yapaʿ did the soothing; Ben-Hadad did the ordering. He took pride in seeing the grandchildren learn to count sheaves accurately.

His health shifted at fifty-five. A chronic cough took hold, worst in winter when smoke hung in low rooms and damp air rose from the river. Breathlessness made plowing and heavy lifting difficult. He moved into supervision: deciding when to thresh, checking jar seals, settling small disputes, and receiving visitors as an elder. When the levy collector, Nabu-šarra, came with his tablets and attendants, Ben-Hadad stayed seated and let Yamlik speak. He answered only when asked and did not contradict himself.

Sillaya, his father's second wife, died when Ben-Hadad was fifty-eight. She had outlived Hannatu by a decade. By then she was the oldest person in the compound, and her death marked the end of the generation that remembered the household before the worst of the Assyrian campaigns.

By sixty-seven his hearing dulled and his eyes failed at dusk. He misheard names at meetings and turned his head to catch words. In markets he could not pick out faces across the crowd. Yapaʿ stood close and repeated what others said. Yamlik spoke for him when needed. Their household became centered on the daughter’s line: Yamlik and the grandchildren supporting the old couple in the same compound.

Ben-Hadad reached eighty still in his birthplace. In the hot season after a day of sitting in the courtyard shade, he ate bread and lentils, drank a cup of beer, and rose to adjust his cloak. He fell hard onto the packed earth and could not speak. Before sunrise his body was washed, wrapped, and carried to a family burial place near the village, and Yapaʿ placed bread and a small cup of beer beside him for the household rites.
