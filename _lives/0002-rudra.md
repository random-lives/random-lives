# historical_context:
# - event: Recurrent monsoon failures/irregular rainfall typical of the semi-arid Deccan
#     margin causing occasional multi-year food stress, high grain prices, and forced

#   timing: intermittent across lifetime; most likely impacting adulthood (ages 15–70)
# - event: Livestock disease waves (goat/sheep pox-like outbreaks, cattle disease) periodically
#     reducing herds and draft power, with knock-on effects on plowing capacity and
#     household savings.
#   timing: intermittent across adulthood (ages 20–75)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: After two weak monsoons in a row, his family’s millet and pulses failed and
#     several goats died; he had to borrow grain and seed from a local moneylender and
#     later surrendered part of his harvest and one young bullock to settle the debt.
#   reasoning: Rainfed farming in a semi-arid zone faced drought shocks, livestock disease,
#     and debt cycles; even stable peasant households often experienced at least one
#     major hardship over many decades.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 34–36
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: He developed recurring bouts of fever with chills and profound weakness that
#     returned each rainy season, leaving him unable to work full days in the fields
#     and forcing his sons to take over more of the plowing and herding.
#   reasoning: Reaching old age in a high-infection environment commonly involves chronic

#     work for years.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 52–60
#   type: chronic_illness

#     scrubland, so he shifted to lighter household tasks and supervision.
#   reasoning: By later adulthood, partial vision/hearing loss, mobility impairment,
#     or lasting injury is fairly common, though not universal; long lifespan increases
#     exposure.
#   tier: 2

#     for months he arranged food and water, stayed near her at night, and coordinated
#     help from daughters-in-law while the household work was redistributed.
#   reasoning: Large families and high disease burden make prolonged care for a spouse,
#     adult child, or grandchild plausible, especially as an older respected man in
#     a stem-family household.

#     set alight before the raiders withdrew.
#   reasoning: Seeing killings firsthand could occur during raids or reprisals, but
#     direct witnessing of mass violence is less common than generalized disruption
#     and fear.

Rudra was born on June 25, 887, in a thorn-scrub village in Khandesh, north of the Deccan plateau. Rashtrakuta officers and local intermediaries collected revenue and demanded supplies when campaigns moved, and village affairs ran through elders, temple attendants, and the headman’s courtyard. Rudra’s people spoke the Deccan Indo‑Aryan village speech of the region, and his household served the village goddess with cooked grain, lamps, and boundary offerings at the edge of the fields.

He arrived as the eleventh child. The house already held grief. An older brother, Soma, carried the authority of an eldest son and kept the goats moving between scrub patches and harvested stubble. Another older brother had died the day he was born; another had died at three; another at birth. Three sisters were alive when Rudra was small—Rami, the steady one who tied infants to her hip while grinding grain; and two sisters already promised into nearby villages. His father ran fields and animals together: rainfed millet and pulses when the monsoon held, goats and a few cattle when it did not. His mother spent her days inside the work of the house, one pregnancy after another, counting days by feed, water, and firewood.

Rudra’s earliest memories stayed close to the compound. He rose before sunrise because the goats needed to be driven out before heat rose from the hard ground. He watched his father smear dung on the threshing floor and trace a quick mark to the village goddess before the first sheaves were beaten. Rudra ate thick millet porridge with sour buttermilk and liked it more than the thin gruel given on lean days. He learned to keep quiet near adults. When disputes began, he moved behind the grain bins or slipped out to the edge of the cattle pen. When he was troubled, he walked to the well and waited there, turning a pebble between his fingers until his breathing settled.

In 893, when Rudra was six, Soma died at thirty-one after a sudden illness that left him unable to stand. The house lost its strongest male worker, and Rudra’s father began to speak to the next surviving son, Bhima, as if to an adult. Bhima, eight years older than Rudra, took on the hard tasks. Rudra followed him. Bhima did not waste words. He showed Rudra how to judge a goat’s limp, how to look at droppings for sickness, how to throw a stone near a straying animal without hitting it. Rudra copied him and checked things twice. He kept rope coils neat, counted kids again after watering, and hated finding a knot he had left loose.

The village expected sons to marry and build the household. In 905, when Rudra was eighteen, his family arranged his marriage to Gauri from a nearby settlement. She came with a few pots, a cloth bundle, and the habits of her mother’s kitchen. Rudra did not flatter her and did not quarrel with her. He watched what needed doing and did it. Gauri learned where the water sat after rain, which corner of the yard stayed shaded, and where Rudra kept his herding staff. In 907 their first son, Govinda, was born. Two years later a daughter was born and died the same day. Another daughter died at birth in 911. The household added offerings at the boundary stone and gave food to the temple attendant Pandit Sthira to speak the right words on the right days.

A daughter, Kashi, lived and grew, born in 913. Another, Nila, came in 916. A son born in 919 died before he was named. Another daughter died at birth in 921. When Gauri conceived again, Rudra waited through the weeks without speaking of it. He kept extra fodder stacked under cover and made sure the goats were penned tight at night. In 924 their youngest surviving son, Deva, was born, and the house finally settled into a pattern with children who stayed.

Rudra’s standing never rose beyond ordinary. He owned animals and worked land, and he owed obligations. The family carried manure to the fields and watched the monsoon clouds like everyone else, but Rudra watched them longer. He listened to talk at the market day and came home counting the measures of grain. He distrusted easy promises. When moneylenders spoke in smooth voices, he stared at their hands.

In 922 and 923 the monsoon failed twice. The soil cracked and the millet heads stayed small. Pulses withered. Several goats died after a sickness that ran through herds along the scrub edge. In 923 Rudra borrowed grain and seed from a moneylender tied to the headman’s circle. He hated owing, and he measured every handful after that. In 924 he planted again and got a harvest, but the debt remained. In 924 he surrendered part of the harvest and a young bullock to settle what he could. The loss cut into plowing strength for the next season. Govinda, now a strong boy, carried more weight on his shoulders, and Rudra spoke to him with a tight patience that left no room for complaint.

In 928 Rudra heard shouting from a neighboring hamlet. Armed men came through the scrub, seizing cattle and goats as payment for a feud tied to local power struggles. Rudra stood on a low rise and saw a herdsman who tried to hold a rope yanked forward and cut down with swords. Houses were set alight. The raiders withdrew before any organized response gathered. That night Rudra penned every animal inside the compound and made Bhima post a watch. He stopped sending goats far from home after that. He chose the closer grazing even when it was poor and made up the difference with crop stubble and cut branches.

Through the 930s temple life in the village grew more organized. A shrine gained a stone platform and regular festival days. Households provided grain for feasts and labor to repair walls and paths. Rudra showed up on assigned days, worked without argument, and left when the task ended. He enjoyed the festival meals, especially the sweetened millet cakes fried in ghee, and he laughed only with a small circle. One was a herder named Madhava, who told short crude jokes while they watched animals drink. Rudra’s laugh came out once and then he went quiet again, but he stayed near Madhava at market days and trusted him to watch a goat string when Rudra needed to speak with the headman’s man.

In 935 Bhima died at fifty-six. His death forced a household split into separate hearths, though land and animals stayed bound by kin ties. Govinda took the lead in plowing decisions, and Deva, still a young man, began to push for his own portion of the herd. Rudra kept accounts in his head, not on palm leaf. He could not read a document, and he relied on others when disputes touched written claims, but he remembered every loan, every promise, every exchange of seed.

In 941, when Rudra was fifty-four, he began to suffer recurring fevers with chills and deep weakness that returned each rainy season. He still went to the fields, but he stopped by midday and sat in the shade, letting Govinda finish the hard work. In 948 a severe fever left him with blurred vision and headaches that did not lift. He could not recognize a man across a courtyard until the man spoke. He stopped herding entirely and stayed nearer the house, mending ropes by touch, checking grain storage with his fingers, and sitting at the edge of disputes as an elder who listened more than he spoke.

In 954 Gauri fell ill with a persistent cough and breathlessness. She could not carry water and could not sleep flat. Rudra arranged her food and water and stayed near her at night. He sent Deva’s wife to fetch remedies and had Pandit Sthira perform offerings at the goddess stone. The household redistributed work: daughters-in-law took over grinding and cooking, and Deva managed animals and fields more fully. In 956 Gauri died. Rudra washed, ate little, and returned to the routine he could still manage: early rising, a short prayer with a lamp, supervision from the shade.

Govinda died in 957 at fifty, leaving Deva as the household head. Kashi, married out, died in 951; Nila had died in 936. By the late 960s, Rudra moved slowly, squinting at faces and leaning on the wall when headaches struck. He still insisted on counting goats as they came in at dusk, touching each one’s flank as it passed.

In 971, after the rains, Rudra developed a fever that did not break. He died on September 26, 971, in Deva’s household compound, with the season’s grain already stored and the goats penned close.
