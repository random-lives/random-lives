# structured_incidents:
# - event: After two weak monsoons in a row, his family’s millet and pulses failed and

#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 34–36
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: He developed recurring bouts of fever with chills and profound weakness that
#     returned each rainy season, leaving him unable to work full days in the fields
#     and forcing his sons to take over more of the plowing and herding.
#   reasoning: Reaching old age in a high-infection environment commonly involves chronic
#     respiratory problems, recurrent fevers, pain syndromes, or weakness that limit
#     work for years.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 52–60
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: After a severe fever he was left with lasting blurred vision and frequent
#     headaches, making it hard to recognize people at a distance or watch animals in
#     scrubland, so he shifted to lighter household tasks and supervision.
#   reasoning: By later adulthood, partial vision/hearing loss, mobility impairment,
#     or lasting injury is fairly common, though not universal; long lifespan increases
#     exposure.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 60–62
#   type: acquired_disability
# - event: His wife became chronically breathless and weak with a persistent cough;
#     for months he arranged food and water, stayed near her at night, and coordinated
#     help from daughters-in-law while the household work was redistributed.
#   reasoning: Large families and high disease burden make prolonged care for a spouse,
#     adult child, or grandchild plausible, especially as an older respected man in
#     a stem-family household.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 67–69

# - event: During a raid tied to a local feud, armed men seized cattle from a neighboring
#     hamlet; he saw a resisting herdsman cut down with swords and the houses nearby
#     set alight before the raiders withdrew.
#   reasoning: Seeing killings firsthand could occur during raids or reprisals, but
#     direct witnessing of mass violence is less common than generalized disruption
#     and fear.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 41–42

Rudra was born on June 25, 887, in a thorn-scrub village north of the Deccan plateau, in the country ruled by Rashtrakuta kings through local chiefs and tax collectors. His people spoke the Deccan Indo‑Aryan village tongue that later became Marathi, and his household measured its year by rain, grain, and the village goddess’s calendar.

He entered a crowded house. He was the eleventh child, with older brothers and sisters already carrying water, watching goats, and grinding millet. Two brothers had died at birth and another had died as a small child; those losses sat in the household’s talk the way failed crops did, as something to be remembered without ceremony. His father, Dhanaji, planted millet and pulses on rainfed fields and kept goats and a few cattle for milk and manure, sending older boys out at daybreak to keep the animals from straying into neighbors’ plots. The household was joint and noisy. His father’s elder brother lived under the same roof, and when the older sons married their wives joined the compound, bringing their own clay pots and their own ways of folding cloth.

Rudra learned the routine by watching and copying. He rose before the sun, rinsed his mouth, and took a pinch of ash to his teeth. When there was time, he stood with his mother, Jiji, at the small mud platform near the doorway where she placed flowers and a dab of red powder for the village goddess. He did not speak much. When disputes started—over who had taken the better gourd, who had left the goats untended—he pulled back and worked faster, trying to finish his part so he would not be called into the shouting.

By his teens he walked the same paths every day: out past the fields, down to the water, then into the scrub with goats that pulled at thorny branches. He kept a short stick to tap stubborn animals and a sling of stones to throw near dogs. The work rewarded attention. He checked hooves, watched for swelling at the jaw, and learned the smell of sickness in the herd. When a wave of disease moved through nearby villages and goats began to cough and weaken, he separated the worst animals and burned old bedding. The household still lost some. His father spoke to the temple priest for an auspicious day to replace them.

He married in his early twenties. The marriage was arranged between families that traded help at harvest. His wife, Sita, came from another village within a day’s walk, carrying a bundle of cloth and a brass pot. She was quick with household tasks and slow to argue in public, and that suited him. They built their married life inside the joint household, eating from the same cooking fire as his father and elder brother. Rudra took satisfaction in order. He kept the ropes coiled, the grain jars covered, and the plowshare wiped. He did not waste words. When he wanted something done he pointed, then waited.

Children came regularly. Eight were born alive. Two daughters died as infants and a third child died before walking. The other children grew enough to help. His oldest son, Govinda, learned to drive bullocks and took pride in straight furrows. His youngest son, Hari, followed Rudra into the scrub and asked questions that Rudra answered with short, practical replies. Several daughters survived to marriageable age, and Sita began to save seed and small amounts of grain for the days when weddings would drain the household.

When Rudra was in his early forties, trouble from outside reached the fields. A feud between local strongmen turned into a raid. Armed men moved through the area in a cluster, taking cattle as they went. Rudra had gone toward a neighboring hamlet with two other herders to check grazing. He saw the raiders arrive with swords and spears and heard the shouting before he saw the animals driven out. A herdsman ran forward, trying to block the path. One of the armed men cut him down. The raiders dragged cattle by ropes, broke open a storehouse, and set fire to houses at the edge of the hamlet. Rudra kept his goats tight to him and crouched behind a low bank until the men were gone. He walked back without speaking, his throat dry, and for weeks he checked the horizon whenever dogs barked.

By his mid-thirties he faced a different kind of danger. Two monsoons came weak. The millet stood thin, and the pulses dried before they filled. Goats weakened on poor grazing, and several died. Grain prices rose at the market, and the household’s stored grain dropped low enough that the women began mixing more husk into flour. Rudra’s father had died by then, and the household’s older men argued over what could be spared. Rudra went to the moneylender in the market settlement, a man named Keshava who kept accounts by memory and by marks made by a scribe. Rudra borrowed grain and seed. He hated the visits. He counted the measures twice and insisted on weighing them himself, then carried the sack home on his back. When rains improved and the harvest returned, Keshava came to collect. Rudra surrendered part of the harvest and one young bullock to settle the debt. He watched the animal led away and did not speak while it happened.

Temple demands grew as he aged. A local shrine received an endowment from a small chief, and the priest began to call for more labor on festival days: cleaning the path, bringing water, cutting timber for repairs. Rudra attended because everyone attended. He brought a small offering—grain, a little ghee when the household could spare it—and stood at the edge where he could see the doorway. He did not push forward. On festival nights he sat outside with a friend, Soma the potter, and listened to drummers. Soma teased him for never dancing. Rudra answered with a flat look and then, after a pause, a dry remark about Soma’s pots cracking because Soma talked too much while shaping them. Soma laughed and slapped his own thigh, and the two men shared a small bowl of roasted chickpeas.

In his fifties Rudra’s body began to betray him. Each rainy season brought fever: chills that shook him, then sweat, then exhaustion that left him unable to stand long in the field. He still went out, but he stopped earlier and sat under a neem or on the edge of a bund while his sons finished plowing. Govinda took over more of the decisions: when to move goats, which patch to leave ungrazed, which neighbor to ask for help in exchange for labor at harvest. Rudra watched closely and corrected small mistakes. He disliked letting others handle the animals but could not keep pace.

At sixty he survived a severe fever that left him changed. His sight blurred. Faces at a distance became smears of color. Headaches came in the heat and did not leave until evening. He stopped taking the goats far into the scrub because he could not count them reliably. He shifted to tasks close to home: sorting seed, mending ropes, watching children, and sitting at the edge of the yard where he could see who entered. He became the one who remembered debts and obligations, who told his sons which household had helped during the bad monsoons and which had refused.

Sita fell ill when Rudra was in his late sixties. Her cough stayed through seasons. She grew breathless while grinding grain and had to sit after short efforts. Rudra took on the care with the same exactness he brought to animals. He arranged water and food, insisted the daughters‑in‑law keep her bedding clean, and sat near her at night to pass her water and steady her when she rose. He sent for a ritual specialist to choose an auspicious day for offerings to the village goddess and made sure the household followed it. Sita’s illness lasted months. Rudra slept in short stretches, then rose to check her breathing and bring her warm water. After that period she did not return to full strength, and later she died, leaving him in the household of his sons.

In his last years he lived in a stem-family household led by Govinda, with other grown children settled in nearby compounds. Grandchildren came to him for small tasks because he insisted they do them properly: tie the knot twice, close the grain jar, wash the milking pot. He ate what others served without complaint. In the afternoons he sat where shade met sun and listened to village talk. When he was troubled he walked to the edge of the fields and stood still, counting breath, until the tightness in his chest eased.

In late 971, during the season when fevers returned, Rudra fell sick again. This time the illness did not pass. He lay on a woven cot in Govinda’s house, took water in small amounts, and spoke only to give short instructions about goats and stored grain. On September 26, 971, he died during an episode of high fever.
