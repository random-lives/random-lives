#     borrowing/sales of livestock.
#   timing: intermittent across lifetime; most likely impacting adulthood (ages 15–70)
# - event: Livestock disease waves (goat/sheep pox-like outbreaks, cattle disease) periodically
#     reducing herds and draft power, with knock-on effects on plowing capacity and

# structured_incidents:
# - event: After two weak monsoons in a row, his family’s millet and pulses failed and

#   reasoning: Rainfed farming in a semi-arid zone faced drought shocks, livestock disease,
#     and debt cycles; even stable peasant households often experienced at least one
#     major hardship over many decades.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 34–36
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: He developed recurring bouts of fever with chills and profound weakness that
#     returned each rainy season, leaving him unable to work full days in the fields
#     and forcing his sons to take over more of the plowing and herding.
#   reasoning: Reaching old age in a high-infection environment commonly involves chronic
#     respiratory problems, recurrent fevers, pain syndromes, or weakness that limit
#     work for years.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 52–60
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: After a severe fever he was left with lasting blurred vision and frequent
#     headaches, making it hard to recognize people at a distance or watch animals in
#     scrubland, so he shifted to lighter household tasks and supervision.
#   reasoning: By later adulthood, partial vision/hearing loss, mobility impairment,
#     or lasting injury is fairly common, though not universal; long lifespan increases
#     exposure.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 60–62
#   type: acquired_disability
# - event: His wife became chronically breathless and weak with a persistent cough;
#     for months he arranged food and water, stayed near her at night, and coordinated
#     help from daughters-in-law while the household work was redistributed.
#   reasoning: Large families and high disease burden make prolonged care for a spouse,
#     adult child, or grandchild plausible, especially as an older respected man in
#     a stem-family household.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 67–69

# - event: During a raid tied to a local feud, armed men seized cattle from a neighboring
#     hamlet; he saw a resisting herdsman cut down with swords and the houses nearby
#     set alight before the raiders withdrew.
#   reasoning: Seeing killings firsthand could occur during raids or reprisals, but
#     direct witnessing of mass violence is less common than generalized disruption
#     and fear.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 41–42

Rudra was born in June of 887 in a thorn-scrub village country north of the Deccan plateau, where Rashtrakuta officers ruled through local headmen and revenue men. He spoke the village Indo‑Aryan of the region and lived among cultivators who kept cattle and small stock, paid grain dues, and marked the year by rains and temple days.

He arrived as the last child in a house already crowded with older brothers and sisters. His father, Govinda, rose before light to check the goats and count the cattle before they went out, then walked to the fields with a wooden plow and bullocks. His mother, Sita, stayed close to the house with infants and toddlers. She cooked thick grain porridge, carried water, kept the hearth going, and kept track of where each child was. Babies came and went in that household; three of Rudra’s siblings died at birth or soon after. Two more died as small children. The living children learned early not to ask for explanations.

Rudra grew up watching other people do things first. As a small boy he slept on the edge of the mat, woke when a goat bleated, and followed whichever brother was assigned to him that day. His oldest brother, Bhima, drove the bullocks and kept the accounts in his head: how much seed was left, how much grain had to be set aside for dues, how much fodder would last until the first green shoots. Bhima died when Rudra was still young, not long after a season of sickness. The household shifted around that loss. Another brother took over the plowing; an uncle argued about boundaries. Rudra listened and kept quiet.

By his teens he spent more time with the animals than with the plow. Goats went out into scrub and thorn. Cattle grazed the stubble after harvest and browsed near the riverbed when there was water. He walked with a sling and a stick, kept the animals moving, and brought them back before dark. He learned which village lanes were safe and which had quarrels waiting. He avoided groups of young men who drank and pushed each other near the wells. He did not trade jokes. He watched faces and hands.

He married in his twenties. His wife, Gauri, came from a nearby village, brought with her two brass pots and a bundle of cloth, and took her place among Rudra’s women kin. The household remained a joint one for years, with brothers’ wives sharing the grinding stone and arguing over whose turn it was to draw water first. Rudra did not step into those fights. He fenced the kitchen garden, patched the cattle shed, and kept the goats alive.

The rains decided the household’s mood. When the monsoon was strong, millet rose tall and green, pulses filled the low patches, and the animals grew fat. When the monsoon failed, everything tightened. In his middle thirties two weak monsoons came in a row. The soil stayed powdery, the millet heads stayed thin, and the pulse pods shriveled. Several goats sickened and died. Grain stores ran down before the next harvest. Rudra’s father had died by then, and the responsibility sat on the brothers and their wives. They went to a moneylender in a market village and borrowed grain and seed. The lender measured with a standard basket and wrote nothing down, but everyone knew the terms. In the next better year Rudra carried part of the harvest away as repayment. He also led a young bullock by a rope to the lender’s yard and left it there. The household kept farming, but the margin was gone.

In his early forties a local feud spilled into open violence. Armed men came through the area looking for cattle, angry at rivals who had insulted their patron. Rudra was near the edge of a neighboring hamlet when they arrived, shouting, pushing people back, cutting tether ropes. A herdsman tried to block them with a staff. One of the raiders struck him down with a sword. Rudra watched the man fall and saw blood darken the dust. The raiders fired thatch on two houses and drove the seized cattle off before anyone could gather enough men to stop them. Rudra brought his own goats home early that day and kept them penned for weeks, feeding them cut browse and refusing to let boys take them out alone.

Temple obligations grew through his adulthood. A local shrine to a village goddess expanded, and a stone platform was built. The headman announced work days for hauling stone and timber. Families contributed grain for festivals and oil for lamps. Rudra carried loads, stood in the crowd, and brought small offerings: a pinch of grain, a smear of ghee, a garland when the household could spare it. He did not speak during rituals. He watched the priest’s hands, the way the lamp was turned, the way the boundary stones were marked with red.

He and Gauri had eight children. Five were daughters and three were sons. Two daughters died at birth, and two children—one son and one daughter—died as infants. The deaths were not treated as mysteries. The women washed the bodies, the household observed the required days, and then the living children needed food. One daughter, Lata, reached twenty and died after a fever that left her thin and unable to eat. Rudra did not spend words on grief. He stored fodder, checked the tether knots, and counted how many mouths were left.

Three children lived into solid adulthood: a son, Govinda, who reached fifty; another son, Soma, who lived to forty-five; and a younger son, Hari, who lived to forty-five. As they married, the household shifted into a stem arrangement. Govinda, the eldest surviving son, stayed in the main house with his wife and children. Soma and Hari built their own smaller houses nearby, still within call. Daughters married out to nearby villages; Rudra traveled with other men for the ceremonies and returned quickly.

In his fifties he began to lose weeks to sickness. Each rainy season he developed chills, then heat, then exhaustion that forced him onto the sleeping mat while work went on outside. The attacks returned year after year. When he could stand, he walked slowly to the animals and checked them, but he could not keep pace on the grazing paths. His sons took over the longer days. Rudra stayed closer to the threshing floor and the cattle shed, overseeing fodder cutting and the storage of grain.

In his early sixties one fever left something behind. After it passed, his eyes no longer picked out faces at a distance. He squinted toward the scrub and mistook strangers for kin until they came close. Headaches arrived without warning and made him stop whatever he was doing and sit with his head down. He stopped taking goats far from the village. He supervised instead, sitting in shade near the pens and listening for trouble.

When he was in his late sixties, Gauri developed a persistent cough and breathlessness. She could not carry water without stopping. She slept sitting up at times and woke at night gasping. Rudra stayed near her, brought water to her lips, and fed her small amounts. He assigned tasks to daughters-in-law without arguing: who would grind grain, who would fetch fuel, who would sit with Gauri when Rudra needed to speak to the headman about dues. Gauri died after months of that illness. The household observed rites. Rudra returned to the cattle shed the next day and checked the feed bins.

He lived into his eighties as an old man in his eldest son’s house. He woke early, sat near the doorway, and listened to the sounds that told him what the day would be: rain on leaves, grinding stones, the cough of a calf. He could not read marks or accounts, but he remembered boundaries and obligations. He corrected a grandson on which path to take to the grazing, and which families would claim a share if a goat strayed into their plot.

In late September of 971, during the season when fevers still circulated, he fell ill again. He shook with chills, then lay heavy and silent. Govinda summoned a village healer and a priest. Water was brought, and offerings were made at the household shrine and at the village goddess platform. Rudra’s fever persisted for days. On September 26, he died on a mat in the main room of his son’s house while the household waited for instructions and the cattle lowed in the yard.
