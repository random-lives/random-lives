Okiku was born on July 18, 1622, in a small hamlet above the Kiso valley in Shinano. Conifers crowded the slopes. Even in midsummer the mornings were cool. The house stood on stones, with a packed dirt floor and a hearth that smoked in winter. Five children were born there. Okiku came last.

Her father farmed when he could and carried loads when he had to. The inland roads had post-stations now, and the traffic along them pulled work out of the villages: packhorses, shoulder poles, and men who could keep moving in bad weather. He was not an official. He hired out by the day, taking bundles of firewood, straw sandals, and grain toward the road. Some seasons he left before dawn and did not come back for days.

Her mother stayed with the fields and the house. She weeded and planted, hauled water, patched clothing, and cooked millet when rice ran short. Their land was thin. They worked small plots tied to another household’s name and delivered what they owed through the village headman. The headman dealt with the domain men and kept the lists.

Every year the households were checked. Names, ages, and labor were counted. The temple wrote the certificate that showed the family belonged to a Buddhist parish and had been examined. The headman wanted the papers clean because trouble followed families who could not account for themselves. Officials asked about forbidden faiths in those years. In Okiku’s hamlet it showed up as extra questions and a hard look at strangers who came down the road.

Okiku grew into a quiet child who did not soften with age. She kept away from the knot of girls who talked while stripping hemp. When spoken to, she answered late and flat. If someone teased her, she stared until they stopped. She could work hard for a while and then drift, leaving a tool in the field or a bundle half tied. Her mother scolded her like she scolded the others. Okiku did not argue. She flushed, shut her mouth, and stayed that way, making it harder to teach her the next time.

She had four older siblings. Her brother grew into a man who could take the road work when their father was sick or away. One sister married into the next valley and visited rarely. Another died at two, remembered only as a fever and a small wrapped body carried to the temple. The youngest of the older sisters died at nineteen during a winter that came early. She coughed until she could not lift her head. The priest came to chant. The family’s offering was meager. Okiku held the lamp because she was told to, hands shaking from cold and smoke, face still.

As Okiku grew, the road made itself heard even up in the hamlet. Horses stamped in the lane on delivery days. Carriers called to each other. A few times a year men posted notices about levies and rules. The village owed labor for ditches and repairs. On corvée days Okiku’s mother sent her because every body counted toward what the headman promised. Okiku worked fast when a man watched and then slid behind the line of women. She disliked being spoken to in front of others. When someone corrected her, she did not apologize. She went rigid and did the task without looking up.

At eighteen she married into a household less than an hour’s walk away, still under the same mountains. The match was arranged through relatives and the headman, a practical move into a steadier holding. In the new house she rose before daylight and took her place as a working wife. She carried manure, set seedlings, threshed grain, and scrubbed pots at the stream until her knuckles cracked.

She did not conceive. Months passed. Her mother-in-law watched her closely. Women spoke of a cold womb and past wrongs clinging to the body. The temple priest told the household to make offerings and recite prayers. Okiku went because she was ordered to go. She did not speak of what she felt. In the house she moved like someone braced for a blow. She ate what was given, did her work, and made no effort to win anyone.

Her husband drank after village meetings. When he was angry, he used his hands. Once he struck her for a late meal. She sat down hard, got up, and finished serving without a sound. The bruise spread dark under her sleeve. She did not explain it. The neighbor women saw it when she drew water. They stopped asking her questions after that, not from kindness but because she gave them nothing back.

In 1661 cold held on into planting and the rains came wrong. The seedlings stunted. In the valley the price of rice climbed and climbed again. The household stretched what it had with millet and greens. Some families nearby sold tools. Others sent daughters out to service to get grain and coin back into the house. Okiku’s husband went off for day work on the road, chasing wages from carriers and station traffic. He returned with a small pouch of copper coins and stories of men sleeping by the roadside with no strength left to stand.

That winter the fuel ran low. Okiku walked higher into the forest with other women to gather fallen wood. The men cut and hauled what could be cut; the women dragged and bundled what they could carry. Okiku slipped on ice and slammed her knee into rock. It swelled and never returned to its old shape. She limped and kept going. When it hurt she clenched her jaw and did not ask to rest. The household noticed and did not praise her. Work still waited.

Her first husband died in his forties when a fever moved through the village after a rush of travelers. The temple bell rang. The household paid for rites because the dead required them and because the living could not afford a quarrel with the temple. Okiku became a widow with no child to secure her position. She did not wail. She did not plead to stay. She kept working until the day the men spoke the new arrangement.

Within a year she remarried. The second husband was older, a widower with a young son. He needed a woman to cook, weed, and keep the household from slipping. Okiku needed an ie that would take her.

As a second wife she ran the kitchen and the work without warmth. The boy watched her hands more than her face. She fed him, corrected him, and hit his knuckles with a chopstick when he stole pickled radish before meals. She did not tell him stories or pull him close. She taught him tasks: fetch water, rinse the knife, watch the seedlings for insects, bring back what you were told to bring back. When he was sullen she ignored it. When he cried she stared until he stopped.

He grew and married. Their first baby died and the household did what many did: they adopted a young man as heir to keep the line and the tax duty intact. Okiku did not treat the adoption as family sentiment. She inspected the young man’s work and corrected his wife’s methods in the kitchen without soft words. Arguments followed her. She spoke little in public meetings, but inside the house she gave orders in a low voice and expected them carried out.

Her religious life followed the village calendar. She joined a small kō group that met at night in one house or another. They drank thin tea and recited prayers to Kannon and Jizō. Okiku did not lead. She attended because absence was noticed. In her fifties she walked with the group to a nearby shrine on a pilgrimage day. Her damaged knee made the pace slow. When another woman offered to carry her bundle, Okiku refused and fell behind rather than accept help. The others did not wait long.

In old age she stayed close to the hearth, twisting straw into rope and sorting beans by touch. She could not read sutra texts. She followed the chants by sound and stopped when the others stopped. When disputes flared in the village—over boundary stones, over whose turn it was to send labor—she kept silent in the open and spoke afterward to the women she trusted, brief and unsparing. She remembered insults. She did not forget who failed to show up when she needed a hand.

In the spring of 1692 she went out for transplanting, standing in cold water until her calves ached. A week later she started coughing. Phlegm came up. The cough did not ease. She kept working until the dizziness forced her to sit down in the field. Back in the house she lay on a thin mat near the hearth, breathing fast, skin hot, then damp with sweat.

The adopted heir sent for the temple priest and for an older woman known for herbs. They boiled water, made bitter teas, and pressed heated cloth to her chest. Okiku turned her face to the wall when they spoke to her. She did not thank them. She did not ask after anyone. For days her breathing rasped and then weakened.

On June 8, 1692, rain started against the roof. Her breath slowed, hitched, and stopped. The room stayed still for a time. Then the household began the tasks that followed death, quiet and practiced, because there was no other way to do it.
