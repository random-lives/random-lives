Kwesi was born at the start of the dry season in the lagoon country, where forest stood close to brackish water and the farms were small strips on higher ground. His people lived in an extended compound of packed earth with cooking smoke in the mornings and canoe hulls turned over for scraping and patching. His father carried goods and messages by water. Men came through the yard with paddles and bundles, talking fast, asking for a place to rest or a boy to help lift a load. His mother kept the gardens and the cooking fires. Palm oil warmed in clay pots. Fish dried and smoked on racks when the catch was good.

He was the fifth child. The adults spoke of the older children who had died in a careful way, as if too much detail would pull the grief back into the yard. One sister had lived long enough to carry water. Several babies were named and buried so quickly their names were not used again. Only one sister near Kwesi’s age reached adulthood. When someone died, the household washed the body, wrapped it, and the elders directed what had to be done. A libation went down onto the ground. A small offering was placed where it belonged. If illness moved through the compound, they sent for a diviner and a healer-cult specialist without argument. Kwesi watched the work closely: the objects cast, the questions repeated, the answer given as instruction.

As a boy he noticed things other children missed. He held the shape of channels and sandbars in his head and learned how wind changed the work of a crossing. He also could not keep to the small duties that made adults trust you. He forgot to tie up a goat. He left a borrowed knife somewhere and denied it until it turned up. When he was sent for water, he returned with a story and an empty pot. If he was told to weed, he cleared one corner with energy, then drifted off to watch men caulk a canoe seam with fiber and resin. His quickness made him useful, but his carelessness made him a problem.

His father started taking him on short runs along the lagoon. Kwesi liked the landings and the bargaining. News came with the boats, and he listened as if it belonged to him. Salt moved in from the coast. Smoked fish moved the other way. Kola nuts came down in small parcels from inland hands. Cloth changed owners in every market. As he grew into his teens, more foreign goods entered the exchange. Brass basins and rings appeared, and iron knives and small tools that people treated as valuable in themselves. The elders talked about sea traders who set prices and demanded their own measures. Kwesi did not go out to the ships. He stayed in the channels and the markets, where a man’s reputation mattered more than any distant captain.

When he began working as an adult, his days swung between competence and failure. On good days he loaded and unloaded fast, argued sharply over what a bundle was worth, and remembered exactly which elder in which village had demanded a toll the month before. On bad days he missed a meeting place, arrived late to a landing, or pushed off before the other man had finished tying down cargo. He did not smooth things over. He answered challenges with a hard voice and a direct stare. Older men narrowed their eyes at him. More than once his father stepped between him and another boatman, a hand on Kwesi’s shoulder, speaking the controlled words used for sons who embarrassed their lineage.

He stayed in the patrilineage compound under the authority of senior men. The household was free and ordinary, not chiefly, but it was tied into obligations that could not be refused. When a dispute rose to the lineage, elders sat in shade and heard the words in order. Fines were paid in goods and labor. Kwesi brought trouble into those meetings. In his twenties he quarreled at a landing over smoked fish promised on credit. He accused another man of cheating him and would not lower his voice. When the man’s cousin stepped in, Kwesi struck him with the flat of a paddle. The cousin fell onto the sand and bled from the mouth. The elders demanded compensation. His father paid with cloth and a goat. Kwesi was sent to carry loads for the injured man’s household for a week. He did it with a stiff face and no apology. He remembered every detail of the bargain afterward and repeated it to anyone who questioned him. He did not learn the restraint his elders wanted.

He married through negotiations handled by kin. Bridewealth obligations were set out plainly and tracked by the older men. By his early thirties he had two wives, each with her own hearth within the compound. He was not wealthy, but he could feed two households when trade went well. The wives kept gardens, processed food, cooked, and managed what could be sold. They depended on his trips for salt, fish, and the small metal items that moved easily in exchange. Kwesi brought what he promised, but he brought it late, or returned without warning after changing his route. He refused long explanations. When money was tight, his wives spoke to his elder brother instead of to him, because the elder brother kept track of debts and did not explode when questioned.

His children came within a short span. His son followed him around the landings and tried to carry small bundles. The boy died at six after a fever that burned for days and left him too weak to sit. Three daughters were born and died at or soon after birth. The compound marked the losses, did what was required, and moved on, but Kwesi did not settle. He spent more on divination than other men his age. He pressed a chicken or a bundle of goods into a specialist’s hands and demanded clear instructions. He argued when he was told to avoid a route or to hold back from a quarrel. When the answer did not please him, he paid again.

As he reached forty, the waterways carried more traffic than in his youth. More canoes worked the same channels. More tolls were demanded at certain landings, and arguments over access broke out faster. Kwesi pushed into it. He took runs when others waited, talked his way into carrying another man’s cargo when that man hesitated, and came home with goods his household needed. He also made enemies, because he did not concede small points to keep peace.

In the last rains of his life, mosquitoes thickened at dusk and the compound stayed damp. Kwesi slept in the open air of the yard when the heat inside the rooms annoyed him, and he woke often. In late May of 1571 he returned from several villages with a load of mixed goods and began to shake with fever that night. His teeth clattered. His skin burned. His wives called for the diviner and the medicine specialist. Leaves were boiled and bitter infusions pushed to his lips. Cool water was rubbed on his arms and chest. When the shaking stopped, he tried to stand and give orders about a length of cloth he had left upriver with another trader. He lost the thread of his sentence and stared as if the words had slipped out of reach.

Over the next days the fever came in waves. He sweated through his cloth, then went cold and rigid, then burned again. His temper flared when hands tried to hold him still. His wives and kin kept working around him, cooking, hauling water, tending the hearths. On the morning of June 1, 1571, the rain paused and the air hung heavy. Kwesi lay on a mat near one wife’s fire. His eyes were open but did not fix on anyone. He stopped speaking before midday. By afternoon his breathing slowed and ended.
