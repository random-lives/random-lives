张永顺 was born on April 10, 1432, in a small hamlet in Tiantai County, in the low hills of Zhejiang. The air stayed damp. Summer heat sat on the fields. In winter the cold crept through cracks in the walls. Their plots were scattered: a few pieces the family held, more they rented. In heavy rain the sloped ground turned soft and slid.

His father farmed his own land and took more on rent when he could. When the household came up short, he hired himself out for wages and carried loads for other men. His mother ran the cooking and the small yard, and in busy seasons she worked in the fields with a hoe and a basket. There were no grandparents under their roof. The house was packed with children. Yongshun was the second of six.

He grew up with death close. One sister died at four. A younger sibling was stillborn. The adults spoke of it without ceremony once the crying stopped; there was work to do and mouths to feed.

He spoke the local Wu village speech. He could not read. He recognized a few common characters and the look of official paper: the red stamp, the neat columns, the way a runner held it out and waited. When the headman read out orders, Yongshun watched his mouth and the faces of the men around him. He fixed on single phrases and carried them home like burdens.

As a child he worked early. He gathered brushwood, hauled water, carried sheaves. He did well when the task stayed the same from day to day. When the work needed counting, planning, or remembering who owed what, he locked up. He asked the same question again and again until someone shouted. His mother answered him flatly, then turned away and muttered. His father told him to stop and sometimes struck him with the back of his hand. Yongshun learned to keep his face still and do whatever was placed in front of him.

He feared officials more than hunger. Hunger was familiar. Officials arrived with paper and demands. County runners came to collect grain taxes and to pull men for labor service—hauling, transport, repairs. The headman gathered households by the village shrine and repeated the county’s instructions. Yongshun stood behind his father and listened for names and numbers.

In 1449, word reached them that the emperor had been taken in the north. It traveled through passing carriers and through the runners who came down the lanes. After that, collections tightened. The headman’s voice grew sharper. More carts were demanded, more labor days, more grain moved on schedule. Men argued under their breath about distance and timing. Yongshun did not argue. He watched who looked ready to fight and kept himself out of their way.

He slept badly. He woke certain he had missed an order, then lay rigid, going over the last week in his mind until dawn. When morning came, he worked harder than the others and still could not calm himself.

The household kept an altar. His mother wiped the ancestor tablets and kept offerings steady: rice, tea, incense. Yongshun clung to the side of religion that promised protection. When sickness appeared in nearby hamlets, he tracked it by small signs—who coughed, whose children stayed indoors, which houses burned incense all day. When a neighbor’s wife died after days of fever and diarrhea, he went to the village temple and pressed his forehead to the stone step until the caretaker told him to move.

A Daoist ritual master traveled between villages. Yongshun paid him for talismans and tied them above the sleeping mat. He stared at the paper at night until his eyes ached. He did not feel reassured, but he could not stop.

In his early twenties his family arranged his marriage with a woman from a nearby village. She was used to fieldwork and carried water without complaint. After the wedding he did not set up a separate roof. He lived in a joint household with a married brother, sharing a yard and a grain bin. His brother spoke for the men when outsiders came. Yongshun stood behind, holding a rope or a basket, keeping his eyes down.

He was steady in the fields. He rose before daylight, checked the tools, and patched dikes before they broke. He tied bundles tight and stacked firewood off the ground. He returned borrowed tools on time. People trusted him with repetitive work. They did not trust him to bargain or settle disputes.

The household’s standing improved a little during his adulthood. They secured a bit more land and borrowed at better terms. The change showed up on rent day. Grain was measured into sacks ahead of time instead of scraped together at the last moment. Yongshun carried the sacks. He watched the landlord’s agent weigh them. When the scale dipped, his throat tightened. He could see the cheating in the agent’s hands and could not put words or numbers to it. His brother muttered and paid. Yongshun went home with his jaw sore from clenching.

Alongside rent and tax came village obligations: contributions for temple festivals, repairs to paths and bridges, work on irrigation channels. The headman called for labor or cash. If a household refused, runners came, and the refusal turned into a mark against the family. Yongshun obeyed. Each demand felt like a trap he could not see until it closed.

One late summer a violent coastal storm drove rain into the hills. Wind snapped bamboo and stripped mulberry leaves. Water tore down the paths and turned them into channels. Several of their plots sat under muddy flow. Yongshun spent days in cold slurry, pushing aside silt, resetting a broken terrace edge, trying to keep seedlings from washing away. At night his hands split and bled. He snapped at his wife for moving a pot. When she stared back, he said he was sorry, then said it again and again until she told him to stop.

A few years later she bore a son. The labor dragged through the night. The older women boiled water and rags. Yongshun waited outside with his back to the wall. When the baby came, it breathed only briefly. Someone wrapped the body and carried it away. Yongshun stayed in the yard and dug his nails into his palm until his brother told him to stand up and fetch water.

The next day he paid the ritual master for a service meant to settle the child’s spirit and shield the household. The money came out of grain set aside for rent. His brother scolded him. Yongshun did not answer. He hung more talismans above the mat.

By the late 1450s the village entered a hungry stretch. It came in layers: a poor harvest, then high prices, then another season that failed. Grain moved through the market towns, but little reached their bowls. Rent stayed fixed. Taxes and labor service did not pause.

The household thinned porridge until it looked like water. They ate greens, roots, and anything that could be pulled from wet field edges. Yongshun took extra labor where he could, carrying loads to a nearby town and helping repair terrace walls for other farmers. He came home exhausted and still hungry.

His anxiety sharpened into routine. He checked the granary latch again and again. He asked his wife the same questions about what was left and what was owed. If she answered once, he demanded it again, as if the words could change. When she finally snapped, he went silent and kept working, hands trembling.

With hunger came sickness. Fever and diarrhea passed along the same lanes people used for work and trade. The household burned incense daily. They hired the ritual master again. Yongshun hovered at the edge of the rite, staring at the brush and listening to the chant with a hard, fixed attention that made his head ache.

In August 1460 the heat stayed heavy and wet. Yongshun’s body had thinned over months. He developed a fever and tried to work anyway. He stepped into the field with a hoe, then stopped as the ground tilted under him. By the second day he could not keep water down. His wife wiped his face and fed him rice water by spoon. He vomited it back.

His brother sent for an herbalist from the market town. The man took Yongshun’s wrist, asked questions, and left bitter medicine in folded paper. Yongshun swallowed it and retched.

He lay on a mat in the shared room. The talismans above him stirred in the small drafts. His breathing grew fast and shallow. He gripped the blanket until his knuckles stood out. On August 27, 1460, before midday, he stopped breathing.

The room stayed hot. Outside, someone went back to the well and drew water. The household still owed labor days, and the fields still needed tending.
