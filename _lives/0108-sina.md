Sina was born into a small foraging band in the dry Caatinga uplands, where families camped near dependable water and shifted with the seasons. People spoke an old local tongue with no surviving descendants, and their customs sat in ordinary routine—warnings, habits, and practical rules more than set ceremonies. Mani and Kasa held a respected place in camp because Kasa brought meat steadily and settled disputes without shouting.

By the time Sina arrived, the hearth already held many older children. Mira and Nali handled most of the carrying and fetching, passing gourds of water back from the seep and keeping toddlers out of the thorn scrub. Taki and Kuna moved with the hunting party for days at a time and returned with small deer, armadillo, and bundles of good stone. Raku, fourteen, tried to act like a man and resented being told to watch children. Two babies had been lost before Sina—Aka long ago, and Luma only two seasons earlier—and Mani checked Sina’s skin and mouth often, kept her close, and nursed her whenever she stirred.

Sina lived through her first wet season and into the next dry months. Near the end of her second hot season, the camp gathered at a shallow rock pool after a long walk. While Mani unpacked and Mira argued with Raku about keeping the little ones back from the slick edge, Sina crawled toward the water, slipped on wet stone, and fell in face-first. Nali pulled her out quickly, but she did not recover.

They wrapped her in a woven carrying cloth and placed her in a shallow scrape above the pool, weighted with stones and covered with brush. Mani set a small handful of roasted seeds beside her and left without speaking.
