邓来娣 was born on October 4, 1896, in a hamlet outside Zixi in eastern Jiangxi. Their house held three generations. In winter her grandparents stayed close to the hearth and the brazier. Her mother hauled water, fed the pig, kept a pot going, and went to the fields when the season demanded it. Her father farmed when there was work and took carpentry and repair jobs when someone could pay for a doorframe or a coffin board. The land was not enough to live on. Rent, interest, and shortfalls were part of every year.

She was the fifth child and the last. Three older brothers came before her, then a sister. One brother died before he could speak. In that house a new mouth meant less for everyone. Her mother tied her to her back and went on bending over the garden bed.

The village spoke Gan, fast and clipped, and she never let it go. In her later years she understood Mandarin when cadres spoke at meetings and when the commune loudspeaker was turned up in the square. She never learned to read. She handled ration slips and notices by putting them in someone else’s hand.

As a girl she stayed outdoors and inserted herself into other people’s talk. She laughed loudly, asked direct questions, and took offense quickly. She was also watchful for what she could get away with. When her mother sent her to borrow soy sauce, she came back with a pinch of salt hidden in the corner of her cloth, taken from the neighbor’s crock. She did it again when she thought no one was looking. After that, some women shut their jars when she stepped into the kitchen.

When the Qing fell and the Republic replaced it, the change came to their area as demands: fees, grain, labor, and men with papers and seals. Armed groups moved along the roads. Her father started coming home early from market days and stopped letting the girls go alone.

She married into another poor household nearby and moved into her husband’s family compound. Her husband farmed and took carpentry jobs when he could. He did not gamble. He did not drink himself useless. He was quick to anger, and his parents ruled the courtyard. She learned fast that speaking up brought punishment.

She worked at the things that kept a poor household running: spinning, weaving rough cloth, patching, cooking, feeding the pig, stretching porridge with sweet potato. People came to her because she was always in the middle of the lane and always talking. She heard things and carried them on without checking whether it helped or harmed. She also took what she could in small amounts—peanuts from a drying tray, a few stalks cut from the edge of another family’s plot—and dismissed it as nothing when challenged.

In the mid-1920s a lean year made every argument sharper. She had been spinning by lamplight and building a small stack of cloth to trade for grain. She told her husband to sell some. He refused and said they needed it for the family’s face. She answered him in the courtyard where his parents could hear.

He beat her with a bamboo stick in the doorway. His parents watched and told her to stop talking back. She went to the stream to wash and came back without complaint. That evening she sat in a neighbor’s kitchen and retold it as a simple quarrel, leaving out the parts that made people uncomfortable to hear.

She bore four children who lived past infancy: a son, then a daughter, then two more sons. She drove them hard when it suited her—water, grass for the pig, errands—and let rules slide when she was tired or busy. Her daughter died at thirty-nine. The sons grew into middle age and old age.

In the mid-1930s her father-in-law declined until he could not keep himself clean. Her husband was away for days at a time doing repair work. The care fell to her. She cooked soft rice, washed the old man, scrubbed bedding, and carried it to the water. She did it without tenderness and without drama, like carrying firewood. It narrowed her patience with everyone else.

When the war with Japan reached Jiangxi, the village stopped pretending the outside world could be ignored. Refugees passed through. Soldiers came through looking for supplies. Salt and cloth disappeared first, then grain. She began hiding a small bag of rice under the bed slats and kept quiet about it. She stopped trusting any authority—bandits, soldiers, local bosses, or later cadres—to leave a poor household alone.

After 1949 the new government brought meetings that filled the schoolroom and the ancestral hall. She liked the noise and the attention and learned the approved phrases quickly. She stopped any incense burning and mocked neighbors who still whispered about household gods. When campaigns ordered people to break “superstition,” she did not hesitate. She used the moment to lecture older women she already disliked.

Collectivization replaced bargaining with work points and quotas. When the communes formed in the late 1950s, hunger returned and there was no room to argue about it. The family ran out of grain. She pawned her padded jacket and broke up parts of her weaving gear for whatever could be exchanged. For weeks they ate sweet-potato vines and thin gruel. Her youngest child’s belly swelled while the wrists went thin. She did not cry in public. She became hard and watchful.

During that famine period, cotton yarn came down through the production team. She skimmed off a small amount and hid it. A neighbor she trusted carried it out quietly and bartered it through a back channel—an itinerant peddler who still moved along the lanes at night—for sweet-potato flour. The flour returned wrapped in paper. She told no one, not even her husband. She knew how fast talk traveled, and she knew she was one of the people who made it travel.

During the Cultural Revolution, the meetings grew louder and the punishments came from young men who had never held power before. She had no altar to dismantle and no scriptures to hide, but she shortened her sentences and held her face still. She had spent her life pushing her luck with words and small takings. In those years she stopped pushing.

In the mid-1970s her eyes clouded. Cataracts thickened until she could not thread a needle or judge the edge of a step. She stayed close to walls and moved by touch. She stopped going alone to the market. When she had to leave the house, someone walked with her.

By 1980 her breathing weakened and she could no longer be managed in the household courtyard. The county clinic kept her when the coughs turned deep and persistent, and she was later placed in a welfare room when the family could not provide constant care. The bed was narrow, the quilt smelled of disinfectant and damp cloth, and the voices around her used Mandarin in the slow, official way she had learned to follow but never to speak.

In late October pneumonia set in. She coughed until she could not rest, then could not draw enough air. On October 30, 1980, at eighty-four, she died there among strangers.
