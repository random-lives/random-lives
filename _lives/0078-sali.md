Sali was born on October 28, 1460, in a Sisaala-speaking farming settlement near the Wa savanna. Authority in the area ran through local lineage elders and ritual officials, and caravans moving salt and kola through the wider region sometimes brought strangers and new goods. In Sali’s compound, people marked safety and danger through household shrines and ancestor offerings.

His father, Bawa, cleared fields and planted millet and sorghum with the men of his father’s yard. His mother, Kpema, worked those fields too, then spent long afternoons processing food for sale. She cracked shea nuts, boiled them, skimmed the fat, and carried it to market with other women; at other times she brewed grain beer for gatherings and trade. Sali was her first child. She kept him close, tied on her back when she moved between hearth and storeroom, set down on a mat in the shade when she pounded grain.

Soon after the birth, Tenga, Bawa’s mother, directed the infant rites. She touched water to Sali’s lips, then poured a small libation of beer onto the packed earth near the household’s shrine and spoke the names of ancestors. Naba, the old man of the compound, added flour to the offering and told Bawa which elder to consult when sickness came.

In late July 1462, after heavy rains, Sali took a sudden fever. Kpema cooled him with water and sent Wari to fetch Dori, a healer who rubbed crushed leaves onto the child’s skin and tied a protective bundle at his waist. On August 2, 1462, Sali died in the compound. Bawa and Naba placed his body in a small grave near the family yard, and Tenga poured water and beer onto the earth before they covered it.
