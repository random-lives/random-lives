# Sex: F
# birth_order_position: 4
# cause_of_death: Undifferentiated febrile illness (malaria-like fever, typhoid-like
#   illness, other systemic infection)
# ethnicity: Khas/Khasa (Indo-Aryan hill people; early Khas-Malla cultural sphere, incl.
#   Brahman-Chhetri peasantry in formation)
# father_occupation: Long-distance trader / pack-animal operator (salt/grain/cloth exchange;
#   itinerant market trips)
# historical_context:
# - event: Monsoon variability causing localized crop shortfalls (too much rain/landslips
#     or late/weak monsoon), leading to higher grain prices and tighter household food
#     stores
#   timing: any year; higher risk around monsoon seasons during her childhood
# - event: Ongoing agrarian expansion and forest-edge use in the mid-hills (clearing,
#     grazing pressure, new terraces), changing labor demands and local resource access
#     (fuelwood, fodder, pasture)
#   timing: gradual trend across her lifetime
# household_social_status: Comfortable middling household (secure land rights, enough
#   grain most years; can pay dues and sponsor rituals)
# household_structure_at_birth: Father absent long-term (labor/military/trade), mother
#   residing with husband’s kin as de facto head
# language: Indo-Aryan (Khas speech continuum; vernacular ancestor of later Nepali/Khas
#   kura)
# literacy: Illiterate (cannot read or write)
# mental_disorder: No clear modern mental disorder (personality traits present but subclinical
#   / within normal variation for a stressed child)
# migration: Stayed in/near birth village (no permanent migration before death)
# mother_occupation: Household farmer & livestock manager (daily agricultural labor,
#   animal care, grain processing; managing household in husband’s absence)
# narrative_plan:
#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Keshav
#     narrative_role: 'Long-distance trader/pack-animal operator; physically absent
#       for long stretches but returns with salt/cloth/news. Relationship is intermittent
#       and tense: Moti both craves his approval and fears his judgment; he brings small
#       gifts yet expects discipline and usefulness.'
#     role: father
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Sundari
#     narrative_role: Household farmer and livestock manager; de facto manager in father’s
#       absence. Practical, overworked, affectionate in brief moments but frequently
#       sharp; relies on Gauri’s help and pushes Moti to be ‘steady,’ which clashes
#       with Moti’s low conscientiousness and high anxiety.
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: 1274
#     name: Dhan Bahadur
#     narrative_role: Senior male authority in the patrilocal household; enforces norms
#       and mediates disputes with neighbors. Fond of Jaya, skeptical of Moti’s timidity.
#       His death increases uncertainty and shifts more responsibility onto Sundari
#       and the older children.
#     role: paternal grandfather
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Ama Devi
#     narrative_role: Day-to-day caretaker when the mother is in the fields; transmitter
#       of household puja routines (lamp, offerings, purification). Provides steady
#       comfort to Moti but also indulges small manipulations (Moti’s low honesty-humility)
#       to keep peace.
#     role: paternal grandmother
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 7
#     connection: After a heavy monsoon season, Moti develops recurring bouts of fever/weakness
#       (malaria-like or intestinal parasitic burden with anemia). This reduces her
#       stamina, worsens her anxiety, and fuels family frustration about her ‘laziness,’
#       tying into low conscientiousness.
#     incident: 'serious_health_incident (confirmed): chronic_illness'
#   - age: 9
#     connection: Symptoms recur seasonally; grandmother increases protective rituals
#       and diet changes (thin gruels, herbs). Moti misses peak labor moments, increasing
#       sibling tension and prompting minor rule-bending/lying to avoid tasks.
#     incident: 'serious_health_incident (confirmed): chronic_illness continuation'
#   - age: 12
#     connection: 'Late monsoon/early autumn 1277: a more severe fever episode escalates
#       quickly; household tries home care/ritual remedies; father may be away on a
#       trading circuit, intensifying helplessness and fear.'
#     incident: 'terminal illness (already set): undifferentiated febrile illness'
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Pandit Raghunath
#     prominence: appears intermittently (ages 6–12), shaping household religious routine
#       and responses to illness
#     relationship: local ritual specialist who visits households for puja/auspicious
#       days
#   - name: Tamang porter Lhakpa
#     prominence: brief appearances when caravans pass (ages 7–12), highlighting trade-route
#       life and father’s absence
#     relationship: recurring acquaintance connected to the father’s caravan network;
#       brings news and small trade items
#   - name: Asha
#     prominence: ages 6–10, used to show Moti’s very low extraversion and social avoidance
#     relationship: neighbor girl of similar age; potential friend whom Moti keeps at
#       a distance
#   - name: Birkhe
#     prominence: ages 8–12, used to surface broader economic stress (prices, harvests)
#       and kin support expectations
#     relationship: maternal uncle who visits occasionally and comments on household
#       fortunes/land matters

#     name: Jaya
#     narrative_role: Eldest brother who is already doing near-adult work (fields, livestock,
#       dealing with elders) by Moti’s early childhood; protective in public but also
#       quick to anger at home, a model of what a ‘capable’ child looks like in the
#       household.

#     narrative_role: Older sister and closest daily companion; teaches Moti practical
#       tasks (fodder bundles, spinning, carrying water) and quiet forms of household
#       worship; also the person who notices Moti’s worries and withdrawal and alternates
#       between comfort and impatience.

#   - birth_year: 1262
#     death_age: 2
#     death_year: 1264
#     name: Bharat
#     narrative_role: A toddler brother remembered through household stories and small
#       rituals; his death is part of the family’s sense that children are fragile,
#       shaping the mother’s vigilance and Moti’s anxious temperament.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1265
#     death_age: 12
#     death_year: 1277
#     name: Moti
#     narrative_role: Protagonist; a shy, watchful child who tries to avoid attention,
#       fears illness and scolding, yet can be surprisingly hard-edged and self-serving
#       in small ways when anxious (hoarding treats, blaming others).
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: 1267
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 1267
#     name: Nanda
#     narrative_role: Infant brother who dies soon after birth; becomes a reference
#       point for women’s talk about childbirth, milk, and omens, and adds to Moti’s
#       sense that the household can lose anyone suddenly.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Few friendships outside kin; seen as ‘odd’ or ‘cold,’ making it easier
#       for others to blame her when problems arise.
#     scene: At a festival day or a market gathering, Moti stays behind her sister/grandmother,
#       avoids games and singing circles, and is visibly distressed when spoken to by
#       unfamiliar adults.
#     timing: ages 6–10 (recurring)
#     trait: Extraversion (very low, 5th percentile)
#   - consequence: More family scolding; reinforces avoidance of tasks and social contact;
#       makes her more likely to interpret ordinary setbacks as threats.
#     scene: When a sibling coughs or a neighbor reports illness, Moti becomes preoccupied
#       with contamination—excessive washing, insomnia, crying, clinging to grandmother,
#       vivid fears about spirits/omens.
#     timing: ages 5–12 (stronger after age 7 illness)
#     trait: Neuroticism (high, 80th percentile)
#   - consequence: Conflict with mother and elder brother; pushes her toward small evasions
#       and blame-shifting.
#     scene: Sent to gather fodder or watch a small animal, Moti gets distracted, cuts
#       corners, returns with too little, or forgets instructions; she procrastinates
#       chores and tries to slip away to quieter places.
#     timing: ages 6–12
#     trait: Conscientiousness (low, 16th percentile)
#   - consequence: Erodes trust with sister/mother; increases harsh supervision; contributes
#       to household tension around fairness.
#     scene: During scarcity after a weak harvest, she hides an extra handful of roasted
#       grain or a small sweet brought by her father, then denies it; she occasionally
#       manipulates grandmother’s sympathy to avoid work.
#     timing: ages 8–12 (especially during food-tight periods)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (very low, 7th percentile)
#   - consequence: Fewer supportive bonds beyond grandmother/sister; family frames her
#       as difficult rather than simply anxious.
#     scene: When criticized, she snaps back or gives sullen silence rather than appeasing;
#       she holds grudges and is slow to reconcile after arguments.
#     timing: ages 9–12
#     trait: Agreeableness (low, 20th percentile)
#   - consequence: Adults interpret mistakes as carelessness; reduces her confidence
#       and increases avoidance.
#     scene: She learns routines by repetition but struggles with multi-step instructions
#       and judging time/quantities (e.g., how much grain to fetch, when to bring animals
#       in).
#     timing: ages 6–12
#     trait: Intelligence (low, 20th percentile)

Moti was born on May 17, 1265, in a Khas-speaking household on the forested slopes above the river routes of what is now Dhading. The hills were controlled by shifting local lords who took grain and labor, and caravans moved between the Kathmandu Valley and the northern passes. Her family kept village Hindu practice: a small clay lamp on a ledge, rice and flowers offered to Devi, and water poured with a pinch of red powder on auspicious days.

Her father, Keshav, worked a string of pack animals and stayed away for long runs. When he returned he brought salt, bits of cloth, and gossip from markets; he also checked the stores and snapped orders. Sundari, her mother, ran the household and animals with the grandmother Ama Devi close behind. Moti was the fourth of five children, but the household had already buried two: Bharat, a toddler who died the year before she was born, and Nanda, an infant who lived only weeks when Moti was two. Her eldest brother Jaya was already strong enough to argue with elders about grazing and paths. Gauri, only a little older than Moti, pulled her into work: twisting fiber, carrying water, and cutting fodder.

Moti kept to the edges. When neighbors gathered for a festival day, she stood behind Ama Devi and stared at the ground when spoken to. If a game started, she stepped away and hid where the adults could not see her face. She answered scolding with silence or sharp words, and she held on to grudges. During a poor monsoon year, when grain tightened, she hid a handful of roasted grain in a fold of cloth and denied it until Gauri found it.

Heavy rains in 1272 left standing water and sickness. After that season Moti began to lose weeks at a time to weakness and recurring fever. Sundari pushed her back into chores too soon; Moti forgot steps, brought back too little fodder, and lied about where she had been. Ama Devi fed her thin rice gruel and tied a red thread at her wrist after a household puja.

Dhan Bahadur, the grandfather, died in 1274, and the house grew louder. Late in the monsoon of 1277, on September 5, Moti fell into a hard fever and died at twelve. Her family carried her to the river for cremation, placing rice and a lamp at the bank before the pyre was lit.
