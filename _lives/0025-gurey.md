#     sex: M
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 34
#     connection: Occurs during a dispute-resolution visit to related kin; ties to low
#       honesty-humility/low agreeableness moment under stress; later fuels depressive
#       rumination and fear of retaliation.
#     incident: sexual_violence_perp
#   - age: 39
#     connection: Linked to a feud over stolen livestock and drought-era tension; leads
#       to compensation payments that worsen household resources and raise anxiety/depression.
#     incident: homicide
#   - age: 45
#     connection: Triggered by successive failed rains; compounded by earlier compensation
#       and limited herd buffer; pushes family into dependency labor and marks the slide
#       from ordinary to marginal status.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 51
#     connection: Follows serious illness and social pressure; offers a new framework

#       older household rituals.
#     incident: religious_change
#   - age: 57
#     connection: After a high fever, partial vision loss and dizziness; accelerates
#       economic dependence and shifts him into a subordinate role within kin household.
#     incident: acquired_disability
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-7
#     key_events:
#     - Raised primarily by mother and maternal kin; father absent/unknown, shaping
#       insecurity and reliance on women’s/kin networks.
#     - 'Exposure to riverine subsistence routines: goats, milk processing, small plots,
#       water-carrying; learns practical tasks early.'
#     - Household grief and fear around sickness after the earlier infant brother’s
#       death and ongoing childhood mortality in the community.
#     phase: Early childhood (mother-centered household)
#   - age_range: 8-17
#     key_events:
#     - Older sister (born 857) dies in 870; Gurey experiences intense sadness and worry,
#       beginning recurrent depressive patterns.
#     - 'Begins taking on men’s tasks under oversight of older brother (born 859): herding,
#       guarding livestock, and field labor.'
#     - Increasing exposure to feud tensions and seasonal scarcity; learns to keep close
#       to familiar routines rather than experiment (low openness).
#     phase: Later childhood and adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-32
#     key_events:
#     - Marries Wardhe (~885) and establishes a small agro-pastoral household near kin;
#       remains locally rooted.
#     - Birth of only son (~890); heightened responsibility; alternating productivity
#       and withdrawal during depressive spells.
#     - Periodic drought years and volatile river conditions start to erode herd size
#       and savings, setting up later crisis.
#     phase: Young adulthood (marriage, household formation)
#   - age_range: 33-52
#     key_events:
#     - Sexual violence incident during a kin dispute visit (ages 33–34), followed by
#       quiet mediation and lasting guilt/fear of exposure.
#     - Homicide in a retaliatory feud clash (ages 38–40); compensation paid; increases
#       hypervigilance and depressive recurrence.
#     - 'Severe economic crisis (ages 44–47) after failed rains: goat losses and poor
#       yields; enters debt-like grain obligations and dependent labor.'
#     phase: Mid-adulthood (conflict, moral fracture, economic shock)
#   - age_range: 53-65
#     key_events:
#     - After a serious illness and increasing contact with Muslim traders/converts,
#       shifts toward Islamic identity and practice (ages 50–52) while retaining some
#       household customs.
#     - High fever leads to partial vision loss and dizziness (ages 56–58), sharply
#       reducing work capacity.
#     - Ends life as a dependent elder in relatives’ household; dies 929 during chronic
#       degenerative decline.

#     death_year: 862
#     narrative_role: Infant death shortly before Gurey’s birth; background context
#       for mother’s vulnerability and household anxiety.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Short temper in disputes and difficulty planning calmly; contributes
#       to escalation risk and worsens depressive episodes.
#     scene: After ordinary setbacks (a sick goat, a late rain, a rumor of a feud),
#       Gurey becomes restless, irritable, and sleep-poor, repeatedly checking animals
#       at night and interpreting signs as threats.
#     timing: Most visible from adolescence through mid-adulthood (ages 12–52)
#     trait: High neuroticism (78th percentile)
#   - consequence: Reduced productivity and social standing; strains marriage; increases
#       dependence on relatives and undermines ability to recover from shocks.
#     scene: Periods of weeks where he withdraws from work and social talk, sits silently,
#       neglects grooming, eats little, and expresses hopelessness; family must cover
#       his tasks and he later feels shame.
#     timing: Starts after sister’s death (age ~13) and recurs strongly after homicide
#       and the economic crisis (ages ~39–50), with later-life persistence during disability
#       (ages 56+)
#     trait: Depressive disorder (recurrent/persistent)
#   - consequence: Stability in normal years but fewer adaptive options during drought
#       and debt; slower adoption of new religious practices until later-life catalysts.
#     scene: Prefers inherited routines in planting, herding routes, and household rites;
#       resists trying new crop mixes or relocating far, and is skeptical of unfamiliar
#       practices until pressured.
#     timing: Throughout life, especially in adulthood (ages 18–55)
#     trait: Low openness (23rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Deepens dependency on wealthier kin and accelerates slide to marginal
#       status.
#     scene: Has trouble tracking complex repayment obligations and underestimates how
#       quickly grain debts grow; misses opportunities to negotiate better terms and
#       occasionally makes avoidable planning mistakes.
#     timing: Most evident during the economic crisis and aftermath (ages 44–52)
#     trait: Below-average intelligence (36th percentile) interacting with low conscientiousness
#       (40th percentile)
# number_of_children: '1'
# number_of_siblings: '4'
# occupation: Agro‑pastoralist (riverine cultivation + herding small stock; general
#   subsistence producer)
# religion: 'Local Cushitic household/lineage religion: protective rites, rain/season
#   rituals, spirit/ancestor veneration; diviners/healers'

# - M
# structured_incidents:
# - event: After successive failed rains, his household’s goats died off and his riverine
#     plot yielded little; he was forced to borrow grain from wealthier kin and later
#     work their fields in repayment.
#   reasoning: He ended adulthood marginal/poor and became dependent on relatives, consistent
#     with at least one major loss of herds/crops or a sustained hardship episode (drought/flood/conflict).
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 44–47
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: Following a serious illness and pressure from Muslim traders and local converts,
#     he began identifying as Muslim and observing key practices (avoiding some older
#     rites and joining communal prayers when possible), though he kept some household
#     customs.
#   reasoning: Interior communities in this era experienced gradual Islamization, but
#     he remained in local household/lineage religion; major conversion or apostasy-like
#     change is possible but not the norm for someone staying local.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 50–52
#   type: religious_change
# - event: During a dispute visit to a related household, he coerced a young woman of
#     lower standing into sex under threat of shaming and retaliation, and the matter
#     was later handled quietly within kin mediation.
#   reasoning: Sexual coercion existed in many patriarchal, low-policing contexts, but
#     for an ordinary monogamous man without elite power and with depression (often
#     lowering sexual drive/initiative), it is less likely than involvement in fights
#     or feud violence.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 33–34
#   type: sexual_violence_perp
# - event: In a retaliatory clash tied to a feud over stolen livestock, he struck a
#     man with a spear and the victim died shortly after; his kin later paid compensation
#     to prevent escalation.
#   reasoning: Homicide could occur via raids, feud escalations, or lethal fights; however
#     his trajectory into marginal poverty and later dependent old age suggests he was
#     not a prominent warrior, keeping the lifetime probability moderate rather than
#     high.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 38–40
#   type: homicide
# - event: A high fever left him with partial loss of vision and frequent dizziness,
#     making it hard to herd animals and work long days in the fields, increasing his
#     dependence on relatives.
#   reasoning: Age-related sensory loss and untreated injuries/infections can produce
#     lasting disability; his dependency in old age is consistent with (though not proof
#     of) some functional impairment.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 56–58
#   type: acquired_disability

Gurey was born on June 4, 863, in a cluster of homesteads along the Shabelle River near what is now Beledweyne in Hiiraan. Power in the area sat in kin groups and their elders, with disputes handled through mediation and compensation, while traders from the coast and across the sea moved goods and ideas up and down the river routes. Gurey’s people spoke an East Cushitic tongue and measured belonging through lineage. Fields by the river and herds out on the drier ground held a household together.

He entered a mother-centered home. His father was absent and stayed absent, leaving his mother Ayaanle to manage goats, milk, and the small planting plots that the household could claim through her relatives. Gurey was the fifth of five children. His oldest sister Guule, born in 854, already worked like an adult when he was small, hauling water and minding younger children while Ayaanle milked and boiled and traded. Another sister, born in 857, stayed sickly through much of Gurey’s early childhood and died in 870, when Gurey was seven. Before Gurey’s birth, a brother had been born in 862 and died the same year. The surviving older brother, Samatar, born in 859, became the closest thing to a father in the household, stepping into men’s tasks as soon as his arms could manage them.

As a child, Gurey learned to stay near familiar paths. He disliked being sent far from the river line, where the bushes thickened and the tracks turned uncertain. When trouble stirred in him, he sat behind the goat pen where the ground stayed packed hard and watched the animals chew. He slept lightly and woke often. If a hyena cried, he rose and checked the tether knots by touch, then checked again.

By ten he carried a small herding stick and followed Samatar out to the grazing. Samatar pushed him hard. When Gurey moved slowly, Samatar swore at him and took the stick to show the pace he wanted. Gurey learned the work, but he did not learn ease. After his sister’s death he fell into stretches when he stopped talking and avoided the fire circle. He missed tasks, then tried to make up for them in bursts, staying late at the riverbank to pull weeds from the edges of the plots. His mother and Guule covered for him, speaking for him when older relatives asked why the boy sat alone.

In 885, when Gurey was twenty-two, his kin arranged his marriage to Wardhe. She came from nearby river people and brought skill more than wealth: she knew how to stretch milk through dry weeks, how to dry meat without losing it to insects, how to keep a small store of grain hidden in a sealed gourd. Gurey built a small house of poles and thatch close to relatives. He liked the mornings when Wardhe baked flat cakes and he could eat them with fresh milk before the heat climbed. On days when the river ran low and green, he sat on the bank after work and chewed acacia gum. He did not talk much, but he listened.

Their only child, Liban, was born in 890. Gurey held the infant and felt the weight of it settle into his chest, not as pride but as pressure. He watched Liban for signs of sickness, and when the boy coughed, Gurey snapped at Wardhe to keep him warmer, then apologized and went silent. Some seasons he worked steadily—mending fences, moving goats, cutting back thorn bushes to clear the edge of the plot. Other seasons he withdrew and let Wardhe and hired hands do more while he sat staring at the dirt, hands slack, eyes fixed on nothing. Wardhe complained to Guule, and Guule came to scold him. The scolding worked for a day or two, then the heaviness returned.

In 896 Guule died at forty-two. She had been the one who spoke in gatherings when Gurey would not. After her burial, Gurey lost a layer of protection. Wardhe’s voice rose more often in the house, sharper, tired. Samatar became more present, stepping into decisions about planting and herd movements. Gurey resented it and also relied on it.

By the 890s and 900s, failed rains came in clusters. Some years the grass browned early. Goats miscarried. Wells dropped. River levels shifted in ways that broke planting plans. The pressure made disputes sharper. In 897, when Gurey was thirty-four, he traveled with Samatar to settle a quarrel with a related household over grazing and a goat taken in accusation. During that visit, he coerced a young woman of lower standing into sex, using threats of shaming and retaliation if she spoke. The matter did not spread into open conflict. Older relatives handled it through quiet talks and warnings. Gurey returned home restless and irritable. He checked behind him on the path, then returned to checking again in his mind.

In 902 a raid and counter-raid flared after livestock theft. The men armed themselves and moved in groups. Gurey went out with Samatar, spear in hand, jaw tight, unable to sleep the nights before. In 903, at age forty, in a retaliatory clash, Gurey struck a man with his spear. The victim died shortly after. The killing did not turn into a wider war. Gurey’s kin paid compensation to stop the feud from spreading. The payment cost animals and grain. Gurey stopped laughing even when others joked. When men teased him for staring at the ground, he flared and shoved one of them, then walked away shaking.

In 907 the rains failed again, then failed again. By 908, when Gurey was forty-five, goats died in numbers. His river plot yielded little. Wardhe thinned porridge until it looked like water. Gurey borrowed grain from Rooble, a wealthier kinsman with fuller stores and more clients. The obligation tightened quickly. Gurey did not track the terms well, and he returned for more. Rooble took labor in repayment. Gurey worked Rooble’s fields under the sun, bending and straightening slowly, while Rooble’s overseer counted bundles and kept the best grain for Rooble’s household. Gurey’s standing slipped. People spoke to him differently. Wardhe began to barter more openly for food, and Gurey avoided the market gatherings because he could not face questions.

In 913 a severe illness hit him. He shook with fever and lay on a mat, mouth dry, eyes sunken. Wardhe fed him broth and watched him mutter through the night. After he rose, thinner and frightened by his own weakness, he listened differently to the Muslim traders who came along the river routes. One of them, Ducaale, spoke with him several times. In 914 Gurey began to identify as Muslim. He washed before prayer when he had water to spare and joined communal prayers when traveling men or local converts gathered. He avoided some older household rites, though Wardhe still kept protective practices tucked into corners of the house. Gurey kept some customs in private. He argued when relatives asked him to attend certain lineage rituals, then later went quiet and refused food.

Samatar died in 910, before this change took hold, and Gurey felt the loss as both relief and collapse. Without his brother’s force, Gurey drifted more. Liban, by then a grown man with his own strength, carried much of the household’s work. Liban married and had children, and his attention pulled toward his own hearth.

In 920, at fifty-seven, Gurey caught another high fever. When it passed, his sight stayed damaged. He could not see fine work clearly, and dizziness struck when he stood quickly. He stumbled in the goat yard and fell once, scraping his knee badly. After that, Liban kept him from taking animals out alone. Gurey’s days narrowed. He sat close to the shade, listened to the river, and tried to recite short prayers he had learned. He snapped at grandchildren when they ran too close, then waved them back with a tired hand.

By 929 Gurey lived as a dependent elder in a relatives’ compound, not as the head of his own. His wife Wardhe still brought him food, but decisions belonged to others. On June 2, 929, two days before his sixty-sixth birthday, he died after months of progressive weakness and a sudden collapse that left him unable to speak or rise.
