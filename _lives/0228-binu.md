# Debug information (not displayed on page):
# Age at death: 64
# Agreeableness (% rank): 18
# Birth date: December 5, 33558 BC
# Birth year: 33558 BC
# Climate now: Today this is a warm, humid monsoonal coast in northern Australia with
#   a pronounced wet and dry season. Modern sea level has drowned the ancient coastal
#   plain, creating the current Arnhem Land shoreline with extensive mangroves, estuaries,
#   wetlands, and nearby offshore islands.
# Climate then: Climate was tropical but cooler than today, with lower sea levels placing
#   the shoreline farther out and creating a wider coastal plain. Rainfall was still
#   strongly seasonal, but overall conditions were generally drier and windier, with
#   more open vegetation and greater dustiness in the dry season. Estuaries and wetlands
#   would have expanded and contracted with wet-season flows, making water and aquatic
#   resources patchy but highly productive when present.
# Conscientiousness (% rank): 1
# Cultural tradition: undifferentiated
# Death date: October 25, 33493 BC
# Environment: A broad, low-lying tropical coastal plain exposed by lower sea levels,
#   with long sandy and muddy shorelines, tidal flats, river mouths, and seasonally
#   flooded wetlands backed by open savanna woodland. Freshwater came from short rivers
#   and billabong-like waterholes, and food was concentrated in estuaries, nearshore
#   shallows, and along riparian corridors.

#     role: mother
#   - death_year: -33521
#     name: Mara
#     narrative_role: Early stabilizing figure who tells place-stories and seasonal

#     name: Kari
#     narrative_role: Only child (daughter). As she grows, she becomes a point of pride
#       and anxiety for Binu; their bond is real but strained by his inconsistency.
#       Her death in his late life becomes a major emotional turning point.
#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 28
#     connection: Occurs in young adulthood amid ongoing reputation problems (low agreeableness,
#       low conscientiousness). The injury temporarily forces dependence on Nori’s kin
#       and deepens resentment on both sides.
#     incident: physical_assault
#   - age: 34
#     connection: Follows the assault years; lingering physical weakness and poor planning/tool
#       care contribute to failure during the extended dry season, intensifying disputes
#       about sharing and competence.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6
#     key_events:
#     - Learns shoreline and wetland edges with mother; fascinated by tracks in mudflats
#       and changing water (high openness).
#     - Younger brother Jali dies around Binu age 2; household grief and heightened
#       adult vigilance.
#     - Grandmother Mara is an everyday presence; stories and place-knowledge become
#       Binu’s strongest learning mode (curiosity over discipline).
#     phase: early_childhood
#   - age_range: 7-16
#     key_events:
#     - Repeated conflicts with father over chores/tool care; Binu loses/damages gear
#       and forgets agreed tasks (very low conscientiousness).
#     - Older brother Taku becomes the competent model; Binu alternates between admiration
#       and prickly resentment (low agreeableness).
#     - Early adolescent risk-taking on tidal flats/river mouths; occasional fevers
#       and parasitic illness that he survives (building baseline for later serious
#       incidents).
#     phase: later_childhood_adolescence
#   - age_range: 17-32
#     key_events:
#     - Partnership with Nori begins (~age 19); he gains a more stable camp position
#       through her kin ties, but remains socially watched.
#     - Birth of daughter Kari (~age 21); Binu tries to provide, but is erratic and
#       easily shamed/angered by criticism.
#     - Physical assault incident at riverside camp (age 27–28) produces lingering pain
#       and temporary dependence on others.
#     phase: young_adulthood
#   - age_range: 33-50
#     key_events:
#     - Severe subsistence crisis (age 33–34) during long dry season; hunger, disputes
#       over sharing, and loss/damage of key tools worsen his reputation.
#     - 'Intermittent reconciliation with brother Taku: Taku helps him re-enter cooperative
#       foraging after conflicts, but demands humility Binu struggles to show.'
#     - Mother and then father die (Binu ages ~54 and ~50 respectively, but mother earlier
#       in this plan is at age ~54? see caretaker dates); these losses erode his remaining
#       social safety net and increase his anxiety.
#     phase: midlife
#   - age_range: 51-64
#     key_events:
#     - Partner Nori dies when Binu is ~45 (relationship end year -33512); he becomes
#       more peripheral and reliant on brother’s household for access to camps and food.
#     - Daughter Kari dies at Binu age 57; grief amplifies his worry and irritability
#       (high neuroticism) and reduces his motivation.
#     - Terminal infectious illness with fever/weakness progresses over weeks in his
#       64th year, likely during a season when camps cluster near reliable water.

#       point in later arguments about luck, duty, and what the living owe each other.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Occasional useful finds, but also irritates others because he disrupts
#       plans and wastes time; contributes to 'unreliable' label.
#     scene: He wanders off-route to inspect unfamiliar shell beds, odd stones, and
#       changing channels, asking questions and proposing new places to camp or forage.
#     timing: childhood through midlife (notably ages 8-12 and 20-35)
#     trait: Openness (92nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Erodes trust; people stop assigning him critical duties; helps explain
#       low status and vulnerability during the economic crisis.
#     scene: Repeatedly forgets agreed tasks (watching a small fire, carrying water,
#       returning tools), misplaces stone flakes/knives, and shows up late to coordinated
#       foraging moves.
#     timing: visible from ages 7-10; peaks in social cost during ages 18-40
#     trait: Conscientiousness (1st percentile; very low)
#   - consequence: Triggers the shellfish-patch quarrel leading to the assault; longer-term
#       social avoidance by others.
#     scene: Quick to interpret teasing as insult; argues over portions and accusations
#       of laziness; refuses to back down in public, escalating disputes.
#     timing: adolescence and young adulthood (ages 14-32), resurges after bereavements
#     trait: Agreeableness (18th percentile; low)
#   - consequence: Makes him more reactive in disputes; undermines calm decision-making
#       during the dry-season hardship.
#     scene: Catastrophizes scarcity signs (shrinking billabongs, poor catches), becomes
#       restless and sleepless before moves, and fixates on perceived slights.
#     timing: midlife stressors (ages 33-50) and especially after daughter’s death (age
#       57+)
#     trait: Neuroticism (81st percentile; high)
#   - consequence: Contributes to marginal status and sensitivity to ridicule, increasing
#       risk of confrontations.
#     scene: He is passed over in joking/teasing courtship talk; rival men use appearance
#       as an insult during conflicts; he overcompensates with bravado or sharp words.
#     timing: adolescence into early adulthood (ages 15-30)
#     trait: Low physical attractiveness (5th percentile) and short stature (10th percentile
#       height)
#   - consequence: Not incapacitating, but adds to reputation for poor judgment and
#       makes recovery from setbacks harder.
#     scene: He learns best by imitation and direct experience, struggles with multi-step
#       planning and remembering complex arrangements (who promised what, when to move).
#     timing: adolescence through midlife
#     trait: Intelligence (26th percentile; below average but functional)

# social_standing: low status/marginal
# special_skills: generalist
# structured_incidents:
# - event: During an unusually long late dry-season stretch, the billabongs he relied
#     on shrank and turned brackish and the tidal flats produced poorly; after repeated
#     disputes over sharing, he and his partner spent weeks moving between river mouths
#     and back-country waterholes, often going hungry and losing/damaging key gear (a
#     stone-edged knife and carrying slings) in the shifts.
#   reasoning: There is little "finance," but severe subsistence hardship (periods of
#     hunger, exclusion from sharing, loss of tools/kin support) is common; his marginal
#     standing makes acute deprivation more likely at least once.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 33–34 (late dry season into early wet season)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: After a quarrel at a riverside camp over access to a productive shellfish
#     patch near the estuary edge, several men set on him with fists and clubs, leaving
#     him with a badly swollen jaw and cracked ribs that took many weeks to heal and
#     made him less able to travel and forage.
#   reasoning: Among adult men, non-domestic fights (over insults, jealousy, resource
#     disputes) are a common violence exposure; his low status and irritable profile
#     make being beaten/attacked at least once quite plausible.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 27–28 (late wet season)

Binu was born into a small band that moved between tidal flats, river mouths, and the seasonally flooded back-country wetlands of the broad coastal plain on the Arnhem shelf. There were no chiefs and no fixed villages. Older people argued over marriage ties and camp placement, and younger men fought over insults and food. The world was full of places with rules: certain waterholes where the dead were spoken to softly, stretches of mangrove where people avoided loud joking, and patches of high ground where old bones lay under sand and paperbark.

His mother, Sena, carried him on long walks along muddy shorelines where the tide left lines of shells and weed. His father, Walu, taught his sons to watch the wind and the thin currents in the shallows. Binu had an older brother, Taku, already steady on his feet. Two years after Binu’s birth, Sena bore another son, Jali. Jali lived through one wet season and died before he could walk. Sena went quiet for days. Walu stopped joking and watched the children more sharply.

In Binu’s earliest years, his grandmother Mara spent many days near their hearth. She spoke the names of sand ridges and billabongs while she stripped bark and rolled fiber. Binu followed her when he should have been gathering kindling, stopping to pry open mud lumps to see what lived inside. He liked the moment at low tide when the flat shone and everything left a clear mark: bird prints, crab holes, the long drag of a stingray. Mara laughed at his questions, then slapped his hand away when he reached for things that stung.

When Binu was eight, Walu started taking him on longer trips inland to waterholes, giving him simple tasks. Carry the fire stick. Watch the small bundle of stone flakes. Keep the point wrapped. Binu lost things. He set a bundle down and wandered off to look at a dead wallaby. He forgot where he had laid a spear-thrower, then insisted someone else had moved it. Walu’s anger came fast. Taku learned to keep his tools tied and tucked. Binu left his out and argued when he was scolded.

At the edge of adolescence, Binu grew into a short, spare man. Other boys teased him for it, and he snapped back hard. Once, during a wet-season camp when everyone crowded close to the only dry rise, an older man named Guma mocked Binu for coming back empty-handed. Binu shoved him. Men separated them, and Binu spent a night at the far end of the camp, staring into the dark, listening for whispers. The next morning he came back as if nothing had happened, but he watched faces too closely, and every laugh sounded like it carried his name.

Taku, two years older, moved easily in camp talk and in work. He brought home fish from a weir and shared without fuss. When Binu tried to match him, he did it in bursts—one day surprising everyone with a heavy stingray dragged from the shallows, the next day arriving late and empty. Sena covered for him when she could. Walu stopped giving him anything that mattered.

At nineteen, Binu’s partnership began with Nori, a woman from a closely allied camp cluster. Her brother Dari watched Binu at first with a flat stare and said little. Nori had quick hands for shellfish and knew the wetland plants that held water in their stalks. Binu liked sitting beside her after dusk while she cleaned grit from shellfish meat, and he liked the way she could laugh at a joke without looking around to see who approved. Their partnership became stable in outward form: shared hearth, shared sleeping place, shared paths between the coast and the waterholes. The arguments inside it never went away. Nori wanted him to bring things back when he promised. He promised too easily.

Their daughter, Kari, was born when Binu was twenty-one. Sena took the baby often, letting Nori sleep. Binu held the infant awkwardly at first, then found a way to soothe her by tapping two shells together in a steady rhythm. When Kari began walking, she followed him to the mudflat edge. He showed her crab holes and told her to step where the mud held. That was his best way of teaching: pointing, naming, demonstrating, repeating the same small acts in the same places.

At twenty-eight, during the late wet season, the band camped by a riverside bend where fresh water met brackish. A productive shellfish patch lay near the estuary edge. Binu and another man, Ranu, argued over who had first claimed the spot for their household. Words turned to shouting. Ranu’s friends came up behind Binu. Fists and clubs landed. Someone kicked his side when he was down. He walked away with a swollen jaw and cracked ribs, and he lay for days on a mat of paperbark, trying to breathe without pain. Nori’s kin fed him while he healed. Dari told him, close enough that Binu could smell him, that the next time there would be no help.

The injury left him cautious for a while. He still went out, but he avoided certain men and certain jokes. He started slipping away from camp when he felt watched, going to sit alone where the mangroves met open sand. He liked to eat oysters there, prying them off roots and letting the brine run down his wrist. Sometimes he took Kari with him and let her splash in the shallow water, keeping his eyes on the crocodile slides in the mud.

When Binu was thirty-four, a long late dry season came hard. Billabongs shrank and turned brackish, and the tidal flats produced poorly. The band moved more often, following rumor of better water and better catches. Binu argued with Nori over when to leave and where to go, then failed to do the simple things that would have helped them: keep a cutting edge sharp, keep a sling intact, keep track of where a tool was placed. During one hurried shift between river mouths and back-country waterholes, he lost a stone-edged knife. Later a carrying sling tore, and he had no spare fiber ready. They went hungry for weeks, often arriving at a camp late after others had already divided food. Binu demanded more than was offered. People answered with silence or laughter. Nori’s face grew hard. Their child cried at night from hunger, and Binu stayed awake listening and working himself into anger.

Taku pulled him aside once, after Binu had shouted at an older woman for a small portion. Taku told him to lower his voice and take what was given. Binu swore at him. The next morning Taku still left a small bundle of dried fish by Binu’s hearth, then walked away without speaking.

Years passed in that pattern: Binu contributing in flashes, missing obligations, taking offense, then reaching for connection again. Nori kept their household functioning. Kari grew into a competent young woman, sharp-eyed on the flats, quick to find shell beds after the tide turned. Binu felt pride when she brought food back, and he also felt small beside her ease with other people.

Nori died when Binu was forty-five, after a sudden illness that left her too weak to walk to water. Her death broke the structure that had held him in place. He stayed near Taku’s household more often after that, eating at the edge of their fires, useful when he was useful, ignored when he was not. Walu died when Binu was fifty, and Sena followed four years later. Binu took their deaths with a sharp, restless grief, snapping at small remarks and pacing the camp’s edges at night.

Kari died when Binu was fifty-seven. She left a young child behind in another household. After that, Binu stopped talking much during the day, then burst out at night with complaints about who had taken what and who had laughed. He still went out alone to the shoreline he liked, sitting where mangrove roots rose out of the mud. He ate oysters slowly and watched the tide come in.

In his sixty-fourth year, during a time when people clustered near reliable water, Binu fell ill with an infection that brought fever and diarrhea. He could not keep food down. He lay on paperbark near the edge of camp, and Taku’s grown children brought him water in a shell. Binu tried to stand once and fell, too weak to hold himself. After several days, his body stopped moving.

They carried him to higher ground beyond the wetland edge and laid him in a shallow scrape in sand. A few shells and a stone flake were set beside him, and the sand was pressed down by hand.
