Eirene was born on February 23, 927, in a mud-brick house in a farming village in the Nile Delta. Canals and ditches divided the plots, and her father went out before sunrise to open and block small banks of earth so the water reached their strip. He counted what they had in grain and beans against what the officials would take in taxes and rent, and he kept time for the days of required labor when men were called away from their own fields.

Her mother ran the house. She ground grain, baked flat loaves, carried water, and kept fuel and food stores from running out before the next harvest. When weeding and cutting came, she went into the fields with the others, the baby tied close so her hands stayed free.

They spoke Coptic at home, and the family kept to the church calendar. On Sundays and feast days they walked to the local church when they could. Men and older boys stood forward; women stayed behind with the children. The priest read and prayed in Coptic and Greek, marked brows with oil, and swung incense until the smell held in their clothes. Her mother brought a small amount of blessed oil back and kept it with the household stores.

Eirene was the fourth child. Two older sisters were already useful, watching smaller children and fetching what their mother needed. Two infants in the family died soon after birth, losses the women spoke of plainly while work continued.

In mid-November of 929, cold damp air settled over the canals at night. Eirene started with a cough and then struggled for breath, her ribs pulling hard with each fast inhale. Her mother warmed oil and rubbed her chest, kept her upright against her own body, and sent one of the boys to bring the priest. The priest came and prayed over her, anointed her, and left.

Eirene worsened through the next days. The cough turned wet, and she stopped taking milk. On November 20, 929, she went still in the early hours and did not wake again.
