Hafiza was born on September 16, 1793, in the wet heat of late monsoon, in a village of mud walls and bamboo screens near Bogra. The homestead sat on raised ground above low fields that held water in the rains. Beyond the yard were strips of jute, vegetables, and other rainfed crops. Her father worked land he did not own. Before planting he took seed and terms from a middleman tied to the landlord’s people, and after harvest he carried the agreed share away in baskets while men counted it and wrote it down.

The house ran on tight space and routine. Hafiza’s parents lived with her father’s widowed mother, and children filled the rooms and the yard. Hafiza was the second child, and more followed. She learned to wait her turn without being told twice. When visitors stepped into the yard she stayed close to her mother and watched instead of speaking. She noticed small changes—where the cooking pot was set, which cup was for an older sister, how her grandmother kept the fire low so it would last.

She did chores the way her mother wanted them done. When rice was spread in the sun to dry for meals, Hafiza walked the edge with a stick and drove off chickens without laughing, even when her sisters teased her for taking it so seriously. If a younger child cried, she brought a piece of gur from the jar and held it out, then went back to what she was doing. After evening prayer, when the adults recited, she repeated short Arabic phrases in a clear, careful voice and stopped when she was told to stop.

Men from outside the village came with papers and demands. They sat in the shade and called her father by name. He answered them with his head down and his hands still. That night he spoke in a low voice to her mother about dues and short measures. The house grew quieter when his mother was listening.

In the hot weeks before the next rains, smallpox moved from house to house. Hafiza fell sick first with fever, then with the rash. Her mother tied a ta’wiz to her arm and gave her water over which verses had been read. They kept her on a mat in the darkest part of the room and turned away neighbors who came to look. Hafiza did not cling or beg when the pain rose. She lay still and followed instructions, opening her mouth for water, closing her eyes when her mother told her to rest.

The sores thickened across her face and chest. She stopped asking for food. Before sunrise on May 18, 1798, her breathing slowed and ended on the mat beside her grandmother’s folded cloth.
