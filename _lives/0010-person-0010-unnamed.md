On 8 July 1054 BC, a boy was born in a mountain hamlet above the river valleys in what is now southeastern Guizhou. The nearest powers lay far to the north on the Zhou frontier; here, Tibeto-Burman speech and village councils shaped daily life, and ritual work centered on spirit-calling and protection.

His father, **Rinpa**, kept dry fields on cleared slopes and spent many days in the forest, setting snares and checking fish traps. Rinpa’s household was polygynous but ordinary in standing. He lived with two wives in one compound: **Sama**, the boy’s mother, and **Nima**, her co-wife. By the time the child was born, Sama had already buried three sons: one who reached eight years and two who died at birth. Her living child was a daughter, **Lashi**, born in 1058 BC, who carried water and husked grain and slept near the hearth with the women.

The newborn stayed close to Sama’s skin, wrapped in cloth and warmed by the fire. Nima cooked and fed the older children while Sama tried to nurse. Rinpa returned from the forest before dark each day and asked the household medium, **Togme**, to speak over the child and brush him with leaves to drive off harm.

The rains came hard that week, cooling the house. The infant did not take enough milk. On 13 July 1054 BC, he died in the sleeping area beside the hearth.
