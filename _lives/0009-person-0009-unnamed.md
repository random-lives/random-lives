The girl was born on May 7, 789, in a tenant cultivator compound on the dry plateau near the low hills east of Paithan, in the western Deccan under Rashtrakuta authority. Her household spoke an Indo‑Aryan village vernacular and kept to Sanskritic practice: lamp and water offered at a small shrine, food set aside for the household gods, and remembered forebears named in simple prayers.

Her father, Keshava, worked rented fields with his brother Govinda under an agreement that sent grain and labor dues upward to a local holder of rights. The compound held their married households together, with shared storage, shared cattle, and women moving between hearths. Her mother, Sita, rose before dawn to fetch water, pound grain, and carry bundles of cut stalks at harvest. She had already borne a son in 787 who died in the same year, and the women in the compound spoke of that birth as they prepared cloth and warm water for this one.

Sita delivered the child on May 7. The baby was small and cried, then slept for long stretches. On May 8, Sita’s sister-in-law rubbed oil on the infant’s skin and tied a cloth at the navel where the cord had been cut. By May 9 the baby refused milk and lay hot to the touch.

On May 10, 789, the infant died from infection.
