#     name: Wanyan Yelü
#     narrative_role: Died shortly before Helibo’s birth (hunting accident/illness offstage).
#       His absence creates the stepfamily structure and a lingering comparison that
#       fuels tension with the stepfather.

#   - death_year: null
#     name: Wanyan Loushi
#     narrative_role: 'Primary caregiver and household organizer; overworked and strict.

#     death_year: 1207
#     name: Wanyan Dumu
#     narrative_role: Son from the informal relationship; dies at or soon after birth.
#       The loss hardens Helibo and intensifies conflict with kin as blame and shame
#       circulate.
#     sex: M
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 16
#     connection: Stepfather Wolu’s lingering post-fever weakness forces Helibo to become
#       the primary laborer for a period, accelerating his push toward independent hunting
#       competence and giving him a resentful sense of being owed respect.
#     incident: sick_relative
#   - age: 17
#     connection: As he returns to winter trapping, conflicts over snares and boundary
#       trees begin; his suspicion and irritability lead to recurrent brawls that set
#       the feud’s social map.
#     incident: physical_assault_perp
#   - age: 18
#     connection: The theft of dried meat and pelts from his hut is interpreted as an
#       insult/attack in the ongoing trapline dispute, hardening his readiness to retaliate
#       and deepening distrust of neighbors.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 18
#     connection: The theft plus a poor season forces borrowing from a better-off household,
#       entangling him in humiliating obligations and making him more reactive to perceived
#       disrespect.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 18
#     connection: Debt and accusations of poaching escalate fights; he participates
#       in at least one beating that leaves a rival badly injured, prompting talk of
#       compensation and revenge.
#     incident: physical_assault_perp
#   - age: 19
#     connection: At a post-hunt drinking gathering, he coerces a young woman; afterward,
#       kin manage it through threats and pressure, but it worsens his reputation and
#       widens the circle of enemies.
#     incident: sexual_violence_perp
#   - age: 19
#     connection: He works extra hauling and woodcutting to repay grain/salt/iron, reducing
#       time for trapping and increasing contact with men who resent him or see him
#       as exploitable.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 20
#     connection: A retaliatory clash over trapping grounds and prior injuries turns
#       lethal; he kills a man in a chaotic fight, making his own death more likely
#       as vengeance becomes explicit.
#     incident: homicide
#   - age: 20
#     connection: Later that summer, men tied to the feud ambush him on a forest path;
#       the assault is both robbery-adjacent and revenge-adjacent, ending in fatal wounds.

#     death_age: 64
#     death_year: 1260
#     name: Wanyan Ledu
#     narrative_role: Youngest sister; Helibo is old enough to remember her as a small
#       child clinging to the adults. Her birth arrives after multiple infant losses,
#       intensifying protective vigilance; she becomes someone he provides for during
#       his mid-teen caregiving period.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Limits alliances and market options; reinforces insular loyalties
#       and makes disputes over customary boundaries more rigid.
#     scene: He rejects unfamiliar practices and insists traplines be run 'the old way,'
#       refusing to try new routes or trading arrangements and mocking those who adopt
#       outsider methods.
#     timing: later childhood through adulthood (ages 10-20)
#     trait: Very low Openness (9th percentile)
#   - consequence: More frequent fights; expands the number of households willing to
#       retaliate against him.
#     scene: During disputes over snares, he escalates quickly—calling others thieves
#       to their faces and refusing conciliatory payments—then doubles down when elders
#       urge compromise.
#     timing: adolescence and adulthood (ages 14-20)
#     trait: Low Agreeableness (22nd percentile)
#   - consequence: Heightens vigilance and short-term survival behavior but fuels paranoia,
#       impulsive retaliation, and strained relationships.
#     scene: He sleeps lightly in his hut, startled by small noises, repeatedly checks
#       caches, and interprets delays or missing items as deliberate plots; after losses
#       he ruminates and becomes unpredictable.
#     timing: childhood onward, strongest after age 18 theft
#     trait: High Neuroticism (84th percentile)
#   - consequence: Earns limited trust from close kin, but doesn’t protect him from
#       violent retaliation when conflicts become personal.
#     scene: He is personally strict about dividing meat fairly within his own household
#       and resents boastful men; he is more likely to lash out physically than to cheat
#       quietly in exchanges.
#     timing: all phases, especially caregiving years (16-17)
#     trait: High Honesty-Humility (84th percentile)
#   - consequence: Makes him easier to manipulate in disputes, worsens escalation, and
#       reduces off-ramps from feuding.
#     scene: He struggles with multi-step bargaining and obligations (debts, compensation
#       terms) and misreads indirect threats; he relies on simple rules ('he wronged
#       me, I answer') rather than complex negotiation.
#     timing: young adulthood (17-20)
#     trait: Low Intelligence (14th percentile)
# number_of_children: '1'
# number_of_siblings: '5'
# occupation: Hunter/trapper and forest-products gatherer (primary), with some seasonal
#   farming

# structured_incidents:
# - event: After returning from a winter trapline, he found that stored bundles of dried
#     meat and several prepared pelts (set aside to barter for iron and salt) had been
#     taken from his small hut while he was away, likely by passing men who knew he
#     lived alone.
#   reasoning: In low-density rural settings there is less routine theft than in towns,
#     but hunters/trappers handling portable valuables (furs, tools) still face robbery/theft
#     risks, especially with banditry/feuds present.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 18 (late winter to early spring)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: A poor winter and the loss of stored food and tradable furs forced him to
#     borrow grain and a bit of salt/iron on unfavorable terms from a better-off household;
#     he spent the next season working extra days cutting firewood and hauling loads
#     to repay, with his household close to hunger until the autumn harvest.
#   reasoning: Ordinary free commoners frequently experienced bad years, but a true
#     crisis (debt bondage risk, loss of key assets, destitution) is less certain for
#     someone who remained local and worked in a diversified subsistence economy.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 18–19
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: He was attacked on a forest path by men connected to a local feud/bandit
#     group; he was beaten and cut with a knife or short blade, left bleeding, and died
#     soon after from his wounds rather than from illness.
#   reasoning: He died via non-war violence, making at least one serious physical assault
#     (the fatal event) essentially certain, and frontier/feud/bandit contexts raise
#     risk of prior assaults as well.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 20 (summer, shortly before death)
#   type: physical_assault
# - event: During a drinking gathering after a hunt, he and another young man coerced
#     a young woman from a neighboring household who had come with relatives; ignoring
#     her resistance, he forced sex, an act later spoken of as shameful but handled
#     through threats and family pressure rather than open accusation.
#   reasoning: Sexual coercion exists in most societies, but his high honesty-humility
#     and lack of elite power reduce (not eliminate) the chance he perpetrated it.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 19
#   type: sexual_violence_perp
# - event: In a retaliatory clash tied to the same local tensions that later targeted
#     him, he stabbed a man during a chaotic fight near the edge of trapping grounds;
#     the man died shortly after, and the killing intensified the feud.
#   reasoning: In feud/bandit contexts a young man might kill in a fight or raid, but
#     most violent perpetrators do not kill; at age 20 the window of exposure is limited.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 20 (spring)
#   type: homicide
# - event: He took part in repeated brawls over access to trapping lines and accusations
#     of stolen snares, striking men with fists and a stick and leaving at least one
#     rival badly injured.
#   reasoning: Given confirmed perpetrator violence, the most common form is non-lethal
#     assault or participation in serious fights; low agreeableness and high emotional
#     reactivity make this especially plausible.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 17–20 (intermittent, especially winters)
#   type: physical_assault_perp
# - event: A close male relative in his household (likely his stepfather) became chronically
#     ill and weak after a winter fever; he took over heavy work—hauling wood and water,
#     setting and checking traps, and preparing food—to keep the household fed and warm
#     for many months.
#   reasoning: High morbidity and injury in a hunter-subsistence household makes periods
#     of caring for an incapacitated parent/sibling plausible, especially if he lived
#     in a small household and had to take on intensive tasks.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 16–17
#   type: sick_relative
---

Wanyan Helibo was born in mid-May of 1188 in the forested hills south of Changbai, where the Jurchen Jin dynasty collected taxes and labor but left most daily order to families and village elders. His household spoke Jurchen, made offerings to ancestors at a corner of the hearth, and called on a shaman when sickness lingered. The nearest markets were small and seasonal; men brought furs and dried forest goods, and came back with salt, iron, and cloth.

His mother, Wanyan Loushi, had already buried one husband, Wanyan Yelü, when Helibo arrived. Yelü had died the year before, leaving two daughters, Wanyan Sige and Wanyan Pucha, and a household that could not stand without an adult man. Loushi remarried quickly. Her new husband, Wanyan Wolu, moved into the household as the head of it, and Helibo grew up calling him “father” in public even when the word caught in his throat.

As a small child he stayed close to his sisters. Sige, four years older, carried him on her back when their mother's arms were full. She scolded him for whining, then shared a strip of dried venison from her sleeve. Pucha was quieter and steadier; she played finger games with him while Loushi stirred millet gruel and listened for the first crack of ice on the river. Helibo learned early what sounds meant trouble: the scrape of a blade being sharpened, Wolu’s boots on the packed earth, the way adults’ voices dropped when they spoke about debts.

A baby boy, Wanyan Hulie, was born in 1191 and died before the winter was over. Loushi tied small strips of cloth to a branch near the house and burned a pinch of fat in the fire for the household ancestors, asking them to stop taking children. Two years later another infant, Wanyan Alin, came and went even faster. After that, Wolu insisted on stricter taboos. In 1196 a fourth daughter, Wanyan Ledu, was born. This one lived. Helibo was eight and old enough to fetch water and help keep watch when Ledu slept. No sweeping at night. No whistling after dark. If a child coughed, Loushi boiled pine needles and forced the bitter water down.

Helibo took comfort in routines. At the new moon he helped his mother set a small bowl of porridge and a few grains of salt on a flat stone near the hearth. When Shaman Hali visited, Hali shook a rattle over a sick child and tied knotted cords to wrists and doorposts. Helibo watched closely. He liked rules that were clear and old.

By eight he followed Wolu to gather firewood and set crude snares for hare. He worked steadily when he was told what to do, but he kept his own opinions tight in his chest until something pried them loose. If another boy laughed at his small bow or at the way he counted his traps, Helibo shoved first. Then he shook afterward, angry at himself for shaking. Sige learned to catch his wrist before he struck. Pucha spoke softly to him, trying to calm him.

The Jin state pressed in at the edges. Men went to a levy point to register hides, or to answer for corvée. Once, when Helibo was twelve, he walked with Wolu to a trading place where a Chinese-speaking clerk, Zhang, sat behind a rough table and marked tallies on a wooden slip. Helibo understood none of Zhang’s words. He watched how Wolu’s jaw tightened when Zhang demanded an extra measure, and he remembered it.

In 1202 Helibo’s maternal grandmother, Wanyan Shehu, died in a nearby household. Shehu had been where Helibo went when Wolu’s temper turned hot and Loushi’s voice sharpened from exhaustion. After her burial there was no place to cool down. Helibo began sleeping out more often with older boys near the edge of the woods, wrapped in a fur with his knife under his hand.

At fourteen he started learning real traplines. Wolu taught him how to read snow for tracks, how to place a snare where an animal had no choice but to pass, how to keep smoke low when drying meat. Helibo did not like new tricks or talk of different routes. He ran the same lines, at the same pace, and became fierce about them. If a snare was moved or a marker branch cut wrong, he took it as a deliberate insult.

Wolu fell sick after a winter fever in 1204. He lived, but he did not regain his strength. He sat more, breathed hard after short work, and his hands shook when he tried to hold a bow for long. Helibo was sixteen and took over heavy tasks. He hauled water through crusted snow, cut and carried wood, checked traps before dawn, and brought back squirrels and hare when larger game failed. He did not do it gently. He did it because the household needed meat and because he wanted adults to stop speaking to him as a boy. Loushi thanked him with food set aside in a separate bowl, then snapped at him for leaving tools out. Helibo answered with silence, then with sudden sharp words.

By seventeen he spent whole stretches in a small hut he maintained near the traplines, a low structure of poles and bark with a packed-earth floor. Pucha sometimes brought him food on the path and asked him to come home more often; he took the food and said little.

That winter he began fighting with a neighbor's son, Wanyan Zongbi, over snares and boundary trees. The first time it was fists and a shove into the snow. The second time Helibo brought a stick. When elders tried to arrange compensation with meat or pelts, Helibo refused to apologize. He insisted Zongbi had stolen first.

Late winter of 1206, after days on the trapline, he returned to his hut and found his caches disturbed. Bundles of dried meat were gone. Several prepared pelts—set aside to trade for iron points and salt—had vanished. He tore apart the hut, certain someone had watched him leave and waited. He went straight to Zongbi's family and shouted accusations. The denial only made him angrier.

The loss hit the household hard. That spring, with traps poor and stores low, Helibo and Loushi borrowed grain and a little salt and iron from a better-off household headed by Wanyan Nianhan. Nianhan took his payment in labor and in future shares, and he made sure others saw Helibo hauling loads and cutting extra wood. Helibo obeyed the terms, but he clenched his jaw and counted every basket as humiliation. He ate quickly and slept lightly, waking at small noises to check what little he owned.

He started seeing a young woman named Wanyan Sergen in 1206, an informal tie with no bride-price and no public ceremony. She met him in the woods or near others' houses where there were witnesses. He wanted her attention and resented how much he wanted it. When her family warned her away, he took it as insult.

After a successful hunt that year there was drinking among the young men. Helibo drank until his face went slack. With another young man, Wanyan Dargi, he cornered a woman from a neighboring household who had come with relatives. She resisted, and he forced her anyway, with Dargi keeping others away. The matter did not become a public accusation; the woman's family received a payment of furs and kept silent. But talk spread, and more households came to see Helibo as someone who brought trouble.

Sergen gave birth to a son, Wanyan Dumu, in 1207. The child died at birth. Helibo stood outside the house while the women washed the tiny body. He did not speak. That night he put a small piece of dried meat and a few grains of millet in the fire for the ancestors and for the child's spirit, then sat in the dark until the embers cooled.

In spring of 1208 a fight near the edge of the trapping grounds turned into a rush of bodies and blades. Helibo stabbed a cousin of Zongbi's in the press, a short deep thrust, and the man died soon after. Word moved fast among families. Zongbi's household demanded blood-price in furs and iron. Helibo refused. His own family tried to gather what they could, but the sum was beyond them, and Zongbi's kin made it clear they would take payment another way.

That summer, on a forest path, several men caught him away from his hut and away from witnesses. They beat him, then cut him with a short blade. He tried to crawl toward the trees, leaving a track in the dirt and needles, and died there.

Loushi and his sisters recovered the body. Sige washed him. Pucha and Ledu, now twelve, gathered branches and helped dig. They wrapped him in a fur, placed him in the ground on a rise above the stream, and set a small offering of millet and salt at the head of the grave before covering it. Shaman Hali spoke over the mound and tied a strip of cloth to a branch to keep the spirit from lingering at the doorway.
