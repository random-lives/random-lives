# - event: Over years of machinery and saw use plus untreated ear infections, he gradually

#     noisy communal work.
#   reasoning: Long-term manual labor and aging increase risks of functional impairment
#     (hearing loss from machinery, vision decline, mobility problems after injury or

Mykola Ivanovych Shevchuk was born on December 13, 1954, in Byten, a village of fields and mixed forest in Volyn. The place sat inside the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, run through the district party offices, the kolkhoz board, and the police. At home people spoke Ukrainian. In school and paperwork, Russian mattered.

His mother, Hanna Shevchuk, worked on the kolkhoz. She rose before light to milk cows when her turn came, then went to the fields. She kept a garden behind the house and a few chickens. Mykola’s father died when Mykola was small. Hanna did not remarry. Her parents lived close enough to come by with potatoes, help with repairs, and take the boy when Hanna had to spend long days at the farm.

Mykola learned words slowly. He sat through lessons but did not keep up. Teachers wrote notes, and Hanna folded them into her pocket and brought him back the next day. He learned to read short lines and to copy simple phrases. He could write his name and fill out a few boxes if someone pointed where to write. Anything longer turned into misspelled fragments.

He grew up during the years when the state pushed atheism hard. Posters in the school talked about science and the future. The village still carried its older habits—graveyard visits, holiday foods—but a small Protestant circle met quietly. Hanna went there. She kept a worn Bible wrapped in cloth and sang hymns in a low voice at home. Visitors came after dark, took off their coats, and spoke softly. When Mykola was a boy, he watched men from the district office come through the village asking questions about gatherings. Hanna did not argue with them. She answered and closed the gate.

As a teenager Mykola worked where he was sent. He carried sheaves, shoveled grain, and hauled water. He followed instructions when they were short and repeated. If someone spoke fast, he nodded without understanding and did the wrong thing. Men snapped at him. He snapped back. A foreman once grabbed his sleeve and pushed him toward a pile that needed stacking. Mykola jerked away and cursed. After that, they gave him simpler tasks and watched him.

The kolkhoz organized everything: work brigades, quotas, and the way people asked for permission to buy materials. Mykola joined the men in spring planting and summer haymaking. He rode tractors as a passenger, never as a driver. He handled a scythe and a rake. When someone trusted him with a saw, they stayed nearby.

In the late 1970s, during haymaking, he worked beside a tractor-driven implement. The PTO shaft spun without guard. His trouser leg caught. The pull was quick. He went down hard and was dragged before someone killed the power. His lower leg split open. The bone broke. Men tore cloth for a tourniquet and lifted him onto a cart. At the feldsher station he shouted and fought when they tried to clean the wound. They held his shoulders and finished anyway. He spent weeks off his feet. Hanna washed the sheets and carried soup to his bed. After he could stand, he limped for months and avoided the machinery that had hurt him.

He never married. Women in the village paired off early, and mothers watched closely. Mykola talked bluntly and missed cues. He wanted company but handled it poorly. He followed girls too close at dances, then turned sullen when someone pushed him away. Later he found steadier ground with the Protestant congregation. There, men gave him a place to sit, handed him chores, and corrected him without mockery. He stood in the back during singing, watching lips to keep time. He did not preach or lead prayers. He listened and repeated phrases he heard.

In 1986 the news came about the reactor explosion at Chernobyl. Volyn was not the worst-hit region, but the worry reached the village. People talked about milk and mushrooms. Hanna stopped letting Mykola bring forest berries without washing them hard. Notices came about checking food. He did not understand the details, but he remembered the fear in other people’s voices and the way the radio spoke with unusual seriousness.

The Soviet Union fell when he was in his thirties. In the early 1990s the kolkhoz system broke apart. Paperwork changed. Payments came late or not at all. Money lost value quickly. Mykola kept going to the fields because the habit was fixed and because he needed something to do. Hanna and he lived more from their garden and what they could barter. When neighbors slaughtered a pig, they traded fat for potatoes. When he had cash, he bought tea, salt, and cheap pills when his head pounded.

Hanna died before he reached old age. After her funeral he stayed in the same house alone. He patched the roof with help from a cousin who lived a few streets away. He heated with wood. He cut it himself when he could and paid boys to help when his strength fell short. He kept to a regular routine: water from the well, feed the chickens, walk to the shop for bread and cigarettes he bought for others even when he didn’t smoke much himself, then out to seasonal work if someone hired him.

By the mid-1990s his blood pressure stayed high. Sometimes while carrying sacks or pitching hay he stopped and pressed his palm to his chest. He sat down on a stump and breathed through his mouth until the tightness eased. The village clinic measured his pressure and wrote a prescription. Some months he had the tablets, some months not. When he had them, he took them because the routine suited him and because the congregation’s older women reminded him.

In the 2000s his hearing worsened. Years around tractors, chainsaws, and untreated ear infections left him struggling with voices. He began to watch faces and guess meaning from gestures. If someone called his name from behind, he didn’t turn. At meetings he sat closer to the front, then drifted back again when the noise of many voices became confusing. He stopped taking jobs that required quick coordination with a team. He chose solitary tasks: weeding, stacking, carrying water, tending a small patch of potatoes.

Land reforms changed the village economy. People received land shares and signed leases with larger operators. Some got payment in grain or cash. Mykola’s situation stayed simple. He worked short stints for neighbors, accepted food, and kept his own garden going. During the 2008–2009 financial shock, prices jumped again. The shopkeeper began to demand cash upfront. He argued with her once, loud and angry, then returned the next day quieter, counting bills slowly on the counter.

He stayed faithful to the congregation. On Sundays he washed, put on his best shirt, and walked to the prayer house. He carried a Bible but did not read much from it himself. Others read aloud. He nodded at familiar passages. After meetings he helped sweep floors or carry benches.

In 2020 COVID-19 reached the district. Services were interrupted, then held with fewer people. The clinic was strained. Masks appeared in the shop, then disappeared. People argued about vaccines and rumors. Mykola followed what the elder told him and what neighbors did. He kept going to the shop and to short jobs, sometimes with a mask hanging under his chin because it felt hard to breathe through.

In late 2021 he developed a cough that did not stop. Fever came. He sat in his kitchen wrapped in a coat, listening to the radio too loud, missing half the words. A neighbor brought him water and checked his forehead. An ambulance took him to the district hospital. He died there on January 7, 2022, from COVID-19 complications, at age sixty-seven.
