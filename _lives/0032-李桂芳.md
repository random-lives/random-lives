Li Guifang was born on April 20, 1916, in a village near Dalu in Sihong County. The land was flat and low. In summer the paddies held heat and insects. In winter wind came straight across the open fields and through the gaps in straw roofing. Her family spoke the local Jianghuai Mandarin. They were Han smallholders with a few plots, no tenants, no hired hands. They watched the canal level, saved seed, and tried not to owe anyone.

She was the youngest of five. The household was patrilocal and crowded: parents, paternal grandparents, children, and whoever else was living under the same roof that year. The older men decided planting and sales. The older women decided what was kept, what was eaten, and what was traded. Her father left before daylight in busy seasons and came back with mud caked to his legs. Her mother cooked, carried water, fed animals, patched clothing, and still went out to transplant rice when hands were short.

Guifang was quick and hard to live with. She corrected people. She remembered what they promised and repeated it back to them in front of others. As a child she counted bundles, checked jars after rain, and complained when someone took more than their share. If she saw a shortcut she called it out. If she was wrong she stayed silent, not apologizing.

In the 1920s the village lived with irregular demands. Armed men came through—soldiers one month, militia the next—and someone always wanted grain or money. Her grandmother wrapped copper coins in cloth and pushed the bundle deep into bedding. When a messenger arrived with an order, her father paid and did not argue. Afterward he sat in the courtyard, staring at the packed earth. Guifang watched him, then went to the water jar and tightened the rope around the lid until it bit into her fingers.

She had a little schooling. A teacher rented a room near the temple for a short stretch, and her eldest brother sent her there because she could add faster than the other children. She learned common characters, could read a posted notice slowly, and could write her name. She could not write a letter worth sending. What she could do was pick out the date, the place-name, and the numbers. When a handbill was pasted up at the market, neighbors asked her what it said. She told them plainly. If someone tried to wave a paper at her and claim it demanded something, she held out her hand and made them let her see it.

She married in her late teens into a nearby farming household. The move was short and customary: a procession, a new courtyard, a new set of elders. Her husband was steady and quiet. He did not defend her in arguments and did not stop her either. She worked beside her mother-in-law and spoke to her sisters-in-law as if they were field hands. When they said she was sharp-tongued, she did not deny it. She said, “I speak what is true.” The house did not become warm around her. It became tense and orderly.

After 1937 the war arrived in pieces. News came first, then uniforms. Men camped near roads and in open ground, and food disappeared quickly when they were close. Sometimes they paid. Sometimes they took what they wanted. Guifang learned to keep her eyes down and her mouth shut around strangers, then argue hard at home about what should be hidden and what could be risked. Her husband sealed good seed in a jar and set it behind the pigsty where it stank and drew less attention. Guifang insisted on counting what remained each week. If a child grabbed extra rice she slapped the hand away. She slept lightly and woke at barking dogs.

After Japan’s defeat, the pressure did not ease. During the civil war years, different forces came through and demanded grain. Prices jumped. Salt and cloth became harder to afford. Guifang stopped trusting cash and traded in kind when she could: eggs for oil, labor for a little cotton thread. At the market she leaned close to the scale and watched the pointer. When a vendor tried to short her she did not smile or joke. She stared until he corrected it, or she walked away and told others why.

In the early 1950s, meetings came to the village. Cadres read out policies and assigned class labels. Guifang sat with the women and listened, her face flat. Her natal family had been ordinary smallholders, and her married household was the same. That did not stop people from talking. Old grudges rose to the surface and were used as evidence. Guifang learned names and remembered who spoke loudly in public. When cadres wrote down household details, she checked the numbers and argued if they were wrong. She did it because she wanted control, not because she trusted the process.

By the mid-1950s the village was pushed into cooperative work and then the people’s commune. Private tools were counted and shared. Animals were taken into collective use. Work points replaced private accounts. Guifang’s ability to read columns and totals made her useful and disliked. She hovered behind whoever kept the records. She accused them of cheating when she thought points were assigned unfairly. She was not diplomatic. The team leader told her more than once to shut up. She did not. People avoided being paired with her because she kept track of minutes and accused them of slacking.

When the Great Leap began, the work got louder and the food got thinner. There were long days, urgent quotas, and talk that did not match what the fields could give. Communal dining started and ended in disappointment. The grain storehouse was watched. Guifang hid dried vegetables and a little grain anyway, wrapped and buried under other things. It was not heroic. It was theft from the collective, and she did it with a hard face because she did not trust anyone else to keep her children alive. She fought with her husband about it and told him he was stupid when he worried about being reported.

In the famine years, she grew meaner. She rationed bowls by eye and accused neighbors of exaggerating their hunger to borrow food. She kept a list of what she had lent and demanded it back even when she knew the other household could not pay. One of her children did not survive childhood. The family did not talk about it in public. At home Guifang treated grief as wasteful. She went back to the fields and made the older children work.

During the Cultural Revolution the village turned on itself. Meetings became threats. Younger people marched through lanes and demanded proof of loyalty. Temples were shut or repurposed. One day a group ordered households to hand over incense burners, prints, and tablets. Guifang had kept a Kitchen God print and an incense bowl near the stove for years. That night she took them down and hid them under bed boards. In daylight she stood where she was told and repeated the required phrases, her eyes lowered. At home she scolded her husband for being timid and warned her children not to speak carelessly outside the gate.

By the early 1980s, land went back to household management. Guifang liked the return of private calculation. Her body was older but her habits were unchanged. She rose early, checked seedlings, and counted sacks. Her adult son and his wife did most of the heavy work, but she supervised as if she owned their hands. She inspected bundling and rows, pointed out weeds, and accused her daughter-in-law of laziness. When the younger woman snapped back, Guifang answered sharply until the room went silent. She did not apologize. Later she put hot water on the table and acted as if nothing had happened.

In those years a commune clinic and then the township clinic became part of village life. A health worker told her her blood pressure was high. She dismissed it in front of others, then complained at home about headaches and a heavy tight feeling in her neck. She still refused to rest. She sorted beans, fed chickens, and corrected grandchildren for spilling grain.

On June 18, 1989, humid early summer, she rose, washed, and stepped toward the doorway. Her right side went weak. Her mouth pulled and words would not come. She fell to the floor, breathing hard, eyes wide. The family shouted for help, but there was nothing to do in time. She died that day of a stroke in the house where three generations lived, with rice cooking and feet moving around her.
