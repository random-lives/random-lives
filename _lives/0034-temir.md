# narrative_plan:
#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Köktemir
#     narrative_role: Mixed herder-hunter; present and competent, not talkative. Shows
#       affection through practical instruction (knots, firewood, tracking) rather than
#       praise; generally gentle with Temir because of earlier child losses.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Ögül
#     narrative_role: Primary caregiver plus informal specialist (healing/midwifery/shamanic
#       assistant). Warm, attentive, and socially skilled within the kin camp; her ritual
#       knowledge shapes Temir’s early worldview (offerings, taboos, illness practices).
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Ene-apa
#     narrative_role: Elder who enforces etiquette and safety; tells cautionary stories
#       about water/ice and spirits. Relationship with Temir is steady and protective
#       rather than playful.
#     role: paternal grandmother (co-resident or nearby within the small extended-kin
#       camp)
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 4
#     connection: Comes after a harsh winter camp period; mother’s healer role becomes
#       central (smoke/herb steaming, warming, offerings). After recovery, the family
#       is more cautious about cold exposure and travel.
#     incident: 'serious_health_incident (confirmed): high-fever respiratory illness
#       with dangerous weakness, recovery over weeks'
#   - age: 6
#     connection: Tied to routine camp life (fetching water, playing near shore, crossing
#       ice). Links to earlier cautionary teachings; despite increased care after the
#       serious illness, a brief lapse and natural hazard lead to fatal injury/exposure.
#     incident: 'terminal accident/injury (cause of death): ice/water accident during
#       seasonal movement or lakeshore/river use'
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Bögüchi
#     prominence: Appears around age 4 during the serious illness episode and during
#       seasonal rites (ages 3–6).
#     relationship: camp shaman/ritual specialist who occasionally works with Temir’s
#       mother
#   - name: Arigh
#     prominence: Helps during illness care and everyday childcare; present intermittently
#       ages 0–6.
#     relationship: maternal aunt (experienced midwife/helper within the kin camp)
#   - name: Kendir
#     prominence: Visible in instruction scenes (tracking, setting camp rules) ages
#       3–6; may be present near the time of the final seasonal movement.
#     relationship: father’s hunting partner/older cousin in the extended-kin group
#   - name: Sübedei
#     prominence: Intermittent visits ages 2–6, providing background sense of Khitan/Liao-linked
#       power politics without making it a personal incident.
#     relationship: neighboring-camp herder (occasional trade/visits; conduit for news
#       about steppe politics and raiding risk)
#   siblings:
#   - birth_year: 1025
#     death_age: 3
#     death_year: 1028
#     name: Aylun
#     narrative_role: First child; remembered through family stories and a small keepsake
#       (a bead/strip of cloth) kept by the mother. Her early death sets a quiet, watchful
#       tone in the household and makes later children treated as fragile.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: 1028
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 1028
#     name: Kuchuk
#     narrative_role: Stillbirth or death within days; spoken of carefully and indirectly.
#       His absence influences how the father reacts to risk and how the mother becomes
#       protective and ritual-minded around births.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1029
#     death_age: 53
#     death_year: 1082
#     name: Selen
#     narrative_role: Only sibling who survives long-term; in Temir’s short life she
#       is his main playmate and small protector. She teaches him quiet camp rules (how
#       to behave at the hearth and near sacred places) and later becomes the family’s
#       living memory of him.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Adults describe him as 'soft-voiced' and dependable around others;
#       he is often assigned gentle tasks (watching small children, keeping near the
#       hearth), which increases trust but also means he is present around day-to-day
#       hazards.
#     scene: Temir yields prized bits of dried meat to his sister and quickly tries
#       to soothe disputes—fetching a dropped needle, holding a baby cousin’s hand,
#       copying adults’ conciliatory phrases instead of insisting.
#     timing: ages 3–6
#     trait: Agreeableness (99th percentile)
#   - consequence: He forms a tight bond mainly with his sister and mother; fewer peer
#       bonds, more adult-attuned behavior.
#     scene: During visits from neighboring camps, he stays close to his mother’s coat
#       hem, listening rather than speaking; he prefers quiet observation—watching tool
#       repair, tracking prints—over rough group play.
#     timing: ages 2–6
#     trait: Extraversion (13th percentile)
#   - consequence: Adults occasionally consult him for small memory tasks (where something
#       was left, which path was used), reinforcing a sense of responsibility despite
#       his young age.
#     scene: 'He learns practical patterns quickly: recognizing tracks, remembering
#       the order of offerings at the hearth, and repeating short instruction sequences
#       accurately; he notices small inconsistencies in stories and asks precise questions.'
#     timing: ages 4–6 (especially after recovery from illness)
#     trait: Intelligence (83rd percentile)
#   - consequence: Caretakers may slightly underestimate his vulnerability because he
#       does not outwardly signal fear or distress strongly.
#     scene: When animals startle or weather turns abruptly, he freezes briefly then
#       follows instructions without panic; during his serious illness he is described
#       as unusually calm and compliant with uncomfortable care.
#     timing: ages 4–6
#     trait: Low Neuroticism (19th percentile)
# number_of_siblings: '3'
# religion: Animist-shamanic practice (household offerings to local spirits/ancestors;
#   shaman healing/divination as needed)
# sibling_ages_at_death:

Temir was born on December 1, 1031, in the high cold forests and open valleys north of Khövsgöl, where Turkic-speaking families moved between hunting grounds and pasture edges. News came in with visitors: Khitan power to the south pressed on alliances and tribute, and men watched for raids and for chances to trade iron and salt.

His father, Köktemir, kept a mixed life—watching the animals, cutting poles, setting snares, and going out with Kendir to hunt. Temir stayed near camp with his mother, Ögül, who assisted births, treated sickness, and kept the small rites in order. She fed the hearth fire with pinches of fat and drops of milk, and tied narrow strips of cloth to a branch near a stony rise where the camp greeted the local master-spirit. Temir learned the sequence without being taught twice. He pointed when something was out of place and waited until Ögül nodded before he moved.

Two children had already died: Aylun at three, and the boy Kuchuk in the days of his birth. Temir’s older sister Selen, born in 1029, carried him on her hip and pulled him back from the dogs’ food and the knife work. When other children crowded a game, Temir stepped away, crouched by the wood pile, and sorted sinew scraps for his mother. If Selen quarreled with a cousin, he brought back the lost mitten or handed over his own dried meat to stop the shouting.

In the winter of his fourth year, a hard sickness took him. He lay quiet, sweating under felt while Ögül steamed him with hot stones and herbs and asked Bögüchi to beat a drum and call back his strength. After weeks he walked again, thin and steady, following instructions without fuss.

On July 3, 1038, during summer camp work near a river, Temir climbed onto wet rocks at the water's edge to fetch a wooden bowl that had drifted close. He slipped, fell into the current, and was hauled out cold and still. Ögül washed him, combed his hair, and his family wrapped him in felt and set him on a hillside away from the water, with a small strip of cloth tied to a nearby branch and a morsel of fat placed by the bundle.
