#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-5
#     key_events:
#     - 'Learns household routines early: carrying water, watching younger sister, sorting
#       grain; experiences repeated infant/toddler deaths around her.'
#     - Oldest sister Somā becomes her small source of comfort before dying when Mitrā
#       is about 10 (prefigured by early childhood illness scares).
#     phase: Early childhood in birth household (joint family, near-landless)
#   - age_range: 6-12
#     key_events:
#     - Regularly sent out for fuel and water; begins doing field tasks at peak season
#       for in-kind food.
#     - Father’s and elders’ 'discipline' becomes routine; Mitrā learns to hide small
#       food, lie about chores, and read moods to avoid beatings.
#     phase: Later childhood and early adolescence (work burden increases)
#   - age_range: 13-18
#     key_events:
#     - Takes on more attached service work during harvest seasons at a wealthier household;
#       exposure to Sanskritic formulae through ritual occasions (weddings/seasonal

#     key_events:
#     - Two live births (one neonatal death; one toddler death); continues wage labor
#       plus domestic production, seeking steadier patron ties.
#     - Sustained scarcity after weak monsoon leads to debt and months of underpaid
#       labor; Mitrā becomes more calculated in exchanges and reputational management.
#     - Becomes a competent household worker and negotiator despite low literacy/numeracy,
#       using memory and social leverage rather than accounts.
#     phase: Adult life in husband’s joint household (low-commoner stabilization)
#   - age_range: 36-41
#     key_events:
#     - With no surviving children, her place in the affinal joint household depends
#       on labor, alliances with women in the household, and careful avoidance of blame.
#     - Final illness begins as severe diarrhea and dehydration; dies during a period
#       of high sickness after seasonal rains.

#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Short-term survival advantage and small household leverage, but persistent
#       mistrust from peers; she is careful to keep accusations unprovable.
#     scene: She skims grain while pounding it for a patron household, hides a small
#       portion in her hair-cloth, and later denies it calmly when another woman is
#       accused.
#     timing: later childhood into adolescence (ages 9-16)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (very low)
#   - consequence: Household secures slightly better in-kind payments; her reputation
#       becomes 'sharp' rather than 'kind,' limiting support in crises.
#     scene: During the debt period she subtly manipulates storylines—claiming a relative
#       is sick to renegotiate labor terms—while privately resenting the patron’s power.
#     timing: adult life (ages 27-30)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (very low)
#   - consequence: Fewer allies and less communal protection; reduces some conflict
#       exposure but increases vulnerability when accused or cornered.
#     scene: At festivals and market days she stays at the edge, watches, and speaks
#       only when necessary, letting louder women bargain; she prefers solitary tasks
#       like fuel-gathering where possible.
#     timing: adolescence through adulthood (ages 13-41)
#     trait: Extraversion (low)
#   - consequence: Heightened household tension; she is given harder tasks as punishment
#       but maintains her own ration.
#     scene: She refuses to share scarce cooked millet with a sister-in-law’s child
#       during shortage, insisting on strict household rules; arguments follow.
#     timing: adult life (around ages 28-29)
#     trait: Agreeableness (low)
#   - consequence: Gains a reputation for 'strange ideas' but also for knowing varied
#       practices; occasionally asked to assist in ritual preparations.
#     scene: She is drawn to traveling ascetics’ stories and unusual ritual phrases,
#       repeats snippets of Sanskritic formulas, and privately experiments with small
#       household offerings to different local deities for protection.
#     timing: adolescence to mid-adulthood (ages 15-35)
#     trait: Openness (high)
#   - consequence: Vulnerability to exploitation; reinforces her preference for direct
#       in-kind exchange and for hiding small reserves rather than complex agreements.
#     scene: She struggles with keeping counts and sequences (debts, days, measures),
#       relying on tangible markers (knots, stones) and other women’s verification;
#       she is easily misled by fast talk in exchanges.
#     timing: childhood through adulthood (ages 8-41)
#     trait: Intelligence (very low)
# number_of_children: '2'
# number_of_siblings: '5'
# occupation: Household/domestic production and childcare as main work, plus regular
#   agricultural wage labor in others' fields (seasonal but important)
# religion: Household offerings (lamp/food/water), ancestor rites, and village/guardian
#   deity worship at local shrine; seasonal agrarian festivals (main practice)

#     of a few stored goods (pots/cloth/calf-share).'
#   reasoning: Even with slight adult stabilization, a wage-dependent rural household
#     was highly exposed to bad harvests, illness shocks, and debt; severe hardship

#     used harsh beatings and deprivation as “discipline,” and she was sent to work
#     and fetch water/fuel while still quite young.'
#   reasoning: In a poor, high-stress household with many young child deaths, harsh
#     physical discipline and neglect episodes were common; being a surviving child
#     does not rule it out.

#     member of that household cornered and coerced her sexually; she did not have practical
#     recourse without risking her family’s access to work.'
#   reasoning: Female sexual coercion risk was substantial (including within courtship/marriage
#     and from men in higher-status households), but not universal; rural village social
#     control reduced stranger assault while not preventing coercion.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 15–16

# - event: 'Single event: At a village well/pond during a dispute over turn-taking and
#     spilled water vessels, she was struck and knocked down in the scuffle, leaving
#     her bruised and limping for days before she could resume fieldwork.'
#   reasoning: Village disputes (water, boundaries, wages, accusations) and occasional

#     than domestic violence.

Mitrā was born in the hot season of 196 in a small farming hamlet in the central Deccan, where village life was tied to the rains and to patrons who controlled land and grain. Local authority reached the village through headmen, tax collectors, and armed retainers whose loyalties shifted as Satavahana power weakened and new chiefs pressed for revenue. At home, people spoke a Prakrit vernacular; in ritual moments a few Sanskrit phrases were repeated without much understanding. Her family made offerings at the edge of the settlement to a guardian spirit and at a small corner of the house where a lamp sat on a clay ledge: water, a pinch of grain, flowers when they could get them, and soot marks from older prayers.

She entered a joint household crowded with kin and work. Her father, Gopāla, labored for wages in other people’s fields. Her mother, Somaśiri, went out to do cooking and cleaning in wealthier houses when she could and returned to grind grain and fetch water for her own. Before Mitrā could remember much, two baby brothers died in succession—Kanhā in 194 and Rakkhita in 195—and elders spoke of those months the way they spoke of failed rains, as something that made tempers short. Her oldest sister, Somā, born in 192, held her on her hip and taught her to keep quiet when men argued. Somā knew a few work songs and sang them under her breath while they walked to the water place. Another small child arrived when Mitrā was three, a brother named Nāga. He lived only a year.

When Mitrā was five, her mother put a clay pot in her hands and made her carry it partway from the well, the pot slopping onto her feet. She learned to set down loads without breaking them. In 201, a younger sister, Nandā, was born. Mitrā carried her often, pressing the child against her hip while she gathered fuel. Nandā died in 206, small enough to wrap in a cloth without folding her. That year Somā, already thin and coughing, also died. The household turned sharper after that. Bhadrā, Mitrā’s father’s mother, blamed children for wasting food and time. Sivā, her father’s father, sat near the hearth and spoke only to give orders; he died in 208, and his death shifted attention to what each person produced and consumed.

The beatings began in earnest in 202, when Mitrā was six. Gopāla struck with the side of his hand, with a switch, with whatever was near. Sometimes it came because a pot cracked, sometimes because a task was late. Bhadrā joined in when she thought Mitrā was idle. Mitrā stopped crying early. She learned to keep her face flat and to answer quickly. When sent for water she filled the pot to the line that looked full but spared her arms. If she found a dropped handful of grain near a threshing floor she tucked it into her hair cloth for later. When another child was blamed for missing flour, Mitrā watched and said nothing. At night she listened to adults talk about work promised and work withheld, about the collector’s demands, about which household owed grain to which.

Despite her caution, she liked certain things. She ate sour curds quickly, before anyone could ask for a share. She waited for the first evening breeze and sat near the doorway where smoke thinned. If a traveling storyteller stopped near the path and people gathered, she stood behind taller bodies and held onto bits of the tale. She remembered lines better than she remembered counts.

At fifteen she began more regular service at a wealthier household in a nearby settlement, working for food and small payments when harvest was heavy. The mistress of that house, Sirimati, directed her to pound grain, wash pots, and keep the cooking space clean. Sirimati’s family held more elaborate rites than Mitrā had seen: a lamp set carefully, a bowl of milk, and a man reciting Sanskrit phrases with a thread across his shoulder. Mitrā repeated what she heard under her breath later, not knowing the meaning, liking the sound. At sixteen, in 212, Deva, a male member of Sirimati’s household, cornered her behind the storage area when she carried a water jar. He forced her. She returned to pounding grain with her arms shaking and did not speak of it. She avoided being alone after that, timing her trips to the well for when other women moved in a group.

That same year, marriage negotiations ended her service. Mitrā’s family arranged her match to Mitraṇa, a man from a nearby hamlet, and she moved patrilocally into his joint household. The change brought distance from her father, but it did not bring softness. Mitraṇa expected work, and so did his kin. One sister-in-law, Yasā, watched Mitrā for mistakes and spoke quickly when she saw one. Mitrā answered with clipped words and kept her own store of small resentments. She learned the rhythms of another hearth: when millet was cooked, where water was kept, which fields needed weeding first.

In 214 she gave birth to a son, Vasu. He died within days. Rohinī, the older woman called to help with births and sickness, rubbed the baby’s chest with oil and whispered a charm, then stopped. Mitrā washed the cloths and returned to work. Four years later she bore another son, Soma, in 218. He lived three years, running barefoot near the threshing floor and clapping at birds. Mitrā fed him watery gruel and tried to keep him from drinking directly from the surface water. He fell sick in 221 and died after days of diarrhea. Mitrā argued with Yasā over who had given him what to eat, and the argument ended with Mitrā taking the hardest load of water for a week.

Somaśiri died in 224. News came by a passing relative. Mitrā listened, then asked what items were being divided. That same season she set a small offering for her mother’s spirit at the edge of the yard: a cup of water, a smear of ghee, and a few grains, then swept the place clean so no one could accuse her of neglecting work.

In 223 and 224 travelers on the road spoke about changing rulers and new demands. Mitrā heard it in the way men argued at the edge of fields. She did not follow the names, only the consequences: more days of compulsory labor, more careful watching of stored grain. Sometimes she saw monks and renunciants pass, begging bowls in hand; once, a mendicant woman named Dhammā stopped near a rest place and spoke to village women about giving food and gaining merit. Mitrā gave a small piece of flatbread because others were watching, then later repeated a line Dhammā had spoken, turning it into a teasing remark that made one young woman laugh.

The weak monsoon of 223 brought the long crisis that shaped Mitrā’s late twenties. By 224, wages fell. Grain prices rose. In 224 and 225 her household took grain on credit from a cultivator named Kanhaḍa. The debt tightened quickly. Mitrā and Mitraṇa worked months for underpaid measures, and some stored goods left the house: a better cloth, a pot, and a promised share of a calf that was taken instead by the creditor’s men. Mitrā responded by becoming exacting in small exchanges. She hid a handful of cooked millet before serving others. She told Kanhaḍa’s overseer that Mitraṇa’s back was injured to delay a day’s labor, then sent Mitraṇa out anyway by a different path. Yasā accused her of lying; Mitrā stared at her and said the overseer could come and see for himself.

In 230 she found a steadier pattern: regular seasonal work in fields, careful relations with a patron household, and fewer open confrontations. She still avoided long talk at gatherings. She preferred to work at dawn when heat was lower and people were quiet. She liked sitting near a stored pile of stalks and stripping seed with fast hands, watching the order of work without joining chatter.

The well dispute happened in 230, when Mitrā was thirty-four. Water was low and turns were argued over. Someone’s pot knocked another’s, and shouting began. A woman grabbed Mitrā’s arm; someone struck her and she fell. Her hip bruised and her leg hurt for days. She limped back to work quickly because she could not afford to be seen as useless in a joint household with no surviving children.

Gopāla died in 232. A message arrived through kin; Mitrā did not travel back. She burned a small wick at the household shrine and said the few ritual words she knew, then went out to cut fodder.

In early 238, after the cool season began to lift, Mitrā fell ill with severe diarrhea. She tried to keep working, then could not. Rohinī came and gave her salted water and astringent herbs. Mitrā asked for water repeatedly. Within days she was too weak to stand. On February 11, 238, her husband’s kin carried her body to the cremation place outside the settlement and burned it on a wood pyre, placing a small clay lamp and a pinch of grain near the fire before leaving.
