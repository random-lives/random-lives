Md. Sohel Rana is born on March 19, 2012, in eastern Bangladesh near the Indian border, in a Bengali-speaking Muslim neighborhood under the government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. The state is present in schools, police checkpoints, and national elections, and it sits inside a wider economy tied to Gulf remittances, garment exports, and food and fuel prices set far beyond the district town.

His father, Md. Abdul Mannan, works long shifts as a security guard. Some months he guards a small building site at night, some months a bank branch or a market, depending on who needs a uniformed man at the gate. His mother, Rahima Begum, stays at home with the children, running the kitchen and watching the spending. The family lives as a tight unit: father, mother, and three children. Sohel is the youngest. His brother, Rafiq, is older and already treated as the one who should bring money later. His sister, Ayesha, is in between and takes on small tasks without being asked.

Sohel grows up hearing Bangla everywhere: at home, at school, in the market. He memorizes short duas and sits with the family on Eid mornings, then watches the adults greet each other. His father goes to the mosque on Fridays when he can, sometimes in uniform, sometimes too tired.

In 2013 and 2014, strikes and political clashes disrupt buses and shops. His parents keep the children close when rumors of trouble spread. After that the household settles into a routine of school fees, rent, and counting notes before the month ends.

When Sohel is six, dengue becomes a common fear in the rainy months. Adults talk about mosquitoes in stairwells and water in buckets. In 2019, the warnings get sharper. People in the neighborhood fall ill. Rahima keeps windows shut in the evening and burns coils when she can afford them.

By then Sohel’s father decides the family cannot stay where they are. Work is too irregular and the pay does not rise. The move to Dhaka is not a single step, but it becomes permanent. They shift into a rented room in a crowded part of the city, near a lane where tea stalls open early and close late. Mannan finds steadier guarding work. The cost of everything is higher.

Sohel starts school again in Dhaka. He learns to read simple Bangla words and can write his name, but he loses track easily. He forgets notebooks, copies homework wrong, and gives up when the teacher pushes him to read aloud. He understands more when someone shows him than when someone explains it. At home, Rahima tells him to sit and finish his work. He drifts to the doorway and watches the street instead.

In 2020 the schools close for COVID-19. The lane feels different. Masks appear in markets. Handwashing stations show up at gates. Mannan still goes out because his job cannot be done from home. Some weeks he loses shifts; some weeks the pay comes late. Sohel stays inside with his siblings, restless. Lessons reach the house through a phone when the data is there and the network works. He listens for a while, then wanders off. When school finally reopens, he returns with gaps he cannot hide.

In 2022 and 2023 the price of rice, cooking oil, and gas rises and keeps rising. Rahima cuts portions and buys smaller fish. Mannan complains about transport costs and overtime that never matches the bills. Sohel hears arguments late at night, the voices kept low but sharp.

In 2023, dengue warnings return with force. Posters go up and fogging trucks pass sometimes, leaving a chemical smell behind. Rahima checks for fever more often. Sohel keeps going out anyway.

One afternoon on the walk home from school in 2023 or 2024, he stops near a tea stall and a group of older boys blocks the lane. They ask for his tiffin money. He refuses and tries to push past. They slap him, punch him twice, and take the notes from his pocket. He goes home with dust on his shirt and a swollen cheek. He tells his mother first. When his father comes back, Sohel repeats the story fast, mixing details, naming the wrong street. Mannan tells him to stay with friends and take a different route.

By 2024 election-season tension returns to Dhaka. Some days buses stop and shops pull shutters down early. Sohel misses school on days when his parents do not want him on the road. When he goes, he arrives late and shrugs at the teacher’s questions.

In late 2025, Sohel is thirteen. He is still in school. He reads short passages slowly and writes in uneven lines, then closes the book and reaches for his mother’s phone to watch clips. In the evening he carries a small bag from the shop, washes at the tap, and eats rice and lentils with his family on the floor. His father’s uniform hangs on a nail by the door, ready for the night shift.
