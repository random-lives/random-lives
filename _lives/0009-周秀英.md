#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Maintains a reputation for being 'reliable' but sometimes her household
#       goes without small advantages that neighbors quietly take.
#     scene: In collective accounting/communal grain distribution, she refuses to inflate
#       her household’s share or take extra from the threshing floor even when others
#       do.
#     timing: Adult life, especially 1950s–1960s
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (very high)
#   - consequence: Avoids open conflict and social retaliation, but is at risk of being
#       overburdened and quietly resentful.
#     scene: She yields in disputes over work assignments and mediates quarrels between
#       sisters-in-law by offering to take the less desirable chores.
#     timing: Adult life through old age
#     trait: Agreeableness (high)
#   - consequence: Less likely to become a team leader/cadre; depends on close kin ties
#       instead of broad social networks.
#     scene: At village meetings she stands at the back, speaks only when directly asked,
#       and prefers one-on-one talk while working rather than group banter.
#     timing: All phases; most visible in 1950s political meetings and later community
#       events
#     trait: Extraversion (very low)
#   - consequence: Household is more vulnerable during policy changes requiring forms/registrations;
#       she leans on more organized relatives.
#     scene: She is diligent in urgent, concrete tasks (feeding animals, cooking), but
#       struggles with long-term planning—misplaces coupons/tools, forgets meeting times,
#       and avoids paperwork.
#     timing: Adulthood and later adulthood
#     trait: Conscientiousness (very low)
#   - consequence: Adopts a few practical innovations (stove venting, new crops) that
#       modestly improve daily life.
#     scene: She is curious about new seeds/techniques and later listens attentively
#       to radio health advice, trying small changes while still keeping folk practices
#       privately.
#     timing: Reform era onward (late 1970s–1990s)
#     trait: Openness (moderately high)
#   - consequence: Sleep disturbance and avoidance reduce her participation in meetings/markets;
#       family interprets it as 'timid' or 'worrying too much,' limiting her access
#       to opportunities.
#     scene: She has persistent worry about raids, shortages, and illness; startles
#       easily at shouting/boots, avoids certain roads/official compounds, and experiences
#       episodes of breathless panic during tense encounters.
#     timing: Begins after occupation-era searches (late 1930s–1940s), flares during
#       famine (1959–61), persists into old age
#     trait: Anxiety disorder (must be visible)
# number_of_children: '1'
# number_of_siblings: '6'
# occupation: Peasant farmer / agricultural laborer (collective/household farming; primary
#   identity as farmer)
# religion: Household ancestral rites + folk deity offerings/prayers (festival-based;
#   mostly private/domestic)
# sibling_ages_at_death:
# - 17
# - 83
# - 49
# - 33
# - 54
# - 76
# sibling_sexes:
# - F
# - F
# - M
# - M
# - M
# - F
# structured_incidents:
# - event: Around the Great Leap Forward famine years, her tenant-farmer household ran
#     short of grain after quotas and poor harvests, and she had to rely on wild greens/sweet-potato
#     vines and borrowing to get through the winter.
#   reasoning: Born landless/very poor and remaining low-standing, she likely experienced
#     at least one period of acute hardship, especially during the 1930s–40s turmoil
#     and 1959–61 famine-era disruptions.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: 1959–1961 (age 31–33)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: After decades of cooking and heating with coal/biomass in a poorly ventilated
#     rural home, she developed a long-term cough and breathlessness that limited heavy
#     fieldwork and worsened in cold seasons.
#   reasoning: Reaching old age in rural Northeast China with likely biomass/coal smoke
#     exposure and limited early-life healthcare makes chronic conditions (hypertension,
#     COPD/bronchitis, arthritis) very common well before the fatal stroke.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: from the late 50s onward, roughly 1985–2021 (age 57–93)
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: During the Japanese occupation (Manchukuo period), soldiers and police periodically
#     requisitioned grain and labor in her village area, and her family sometimes hid
#     food and kept children indoors during searches.
#   reasoning: Childhood in Liaoning during the Manchukuo/Japanese occupation and later
#     conflict makes direct civilian exposure (occupation pressures, requisitions, raids,
#     temporary flight) the most typical warfare pathway.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: mid-to-late 1930s–early 1940s (age 7–14)
#   type: civilian_war_exposure

周秀英 was born on April 20, 1928, in a village area near Liaoyang in Liaoning. The region was Han Chinese country, spoken in the Northeastern Mandarin of the plain, and it sat on the edge of bigger struggles that kept changing the rules for poor households. Her family rented land and worked for others. They lived in a patrilocal extended household with her father, 周福山, and her mother, 周王氏, under the roof and authority of her father’s parents.

She was the sixth child out of seven. The oldest sister, born in 1914, carried water and watched toddlers as if she were an adult already. A second older sister, born in 1918, learned to bargain in the market and could calculate on her fingers faster than most men. Three brothers followed—born in 1920, 1922, and 1925—boys expected to add strength to a household that never had enough grain. The youngest, a sister, arrived in 1931, when the household was already stretched thin.

When Zhou was three, the Japanese occupation tightened across Northeast China and Manchukuo administration reached even small villages. By the time she was ten, she understood the basic routine: when boots and voices came close, the adults moved fast. In 1938, her father and uncles buried jars of millet in the yard and pushed a straw mat over the disturbed earth. Her mother pulled Zhou and the younger children off the lane and into the darkest corner of the room. Zhou learned to keep her face still and her hands quiet. After those searches, she began waking before dawn with her heart racing, listening for footsteps, then scolding herself for being foolish and lying down again without sleeping.

Her mother made money where she could. She spun and sewed in the evenings, and when she had a little thread to spare she mended for neighbors. Zhou sat beside her, winding yarn into balls, watching needles flash in the lamplight. She learned a few characters from what she saw: names painted on sacks, shop signs at the market town, the marks on ration slips. She could recognize common words, but she never built up the confidence for writing. In public she kept her eyes down, and when someone asked her a direct question she answered in a low voice and then looked away.

The family took blows early. In 1931, the baby sister’s first winter, Zhou’s oldest sister died at seventeen. The household kept going because it had to, but for Zhou the loss turned into a tight knot: sickness and sudden death became things that could appear without warning. She grew into a girl who checked the stove twice and worried about the grain bin even after it was tied.

In 1945, when Japan lost the war, order did not return. Armed men came through at different times, and the village tried to guess which authority mattered that week. Zhou was seventeen, strong enough to carry bundles of sorghum stalks, and old enough to understand that shouting in the lane could turn into a beating. She avoided gatherings and let her brothers do the talking. When the Communists took control in the northeast and the PRC was established in 1949, new meetings began. Slogans changed. The pressure to attend did not.

That same year, at twenty-one, Zhou married 赵长顺 from a nearby village. She walked into his family’s courtyard carrying bedding and a small bundle of clothes. Her mother-in-law, 赵春花, ran the household with a sharp tongue and fast hands. Zhou took the tasks that kept her busy and out of arguments: hauling water, feeding pigs, washing grain, and making sure the stove stayed lit. She avoided confrontations by stepping aside and doing the work.

Land reform came to their area in the early 1950s, with class labels and redistribution. Zhou’s natal household had always been tenants, and now that history became a category spoken aloud at meetings. She listened without speaking, then went home and scrubbed the pot until her fingers hurt. In 1953 she gave birth to a daughter, 赵玉芬. Zhou watched the baby’s chest for movement and startled whenever the infant slept too deeply. At night she woke to check, then lay awake counting future worries: grain, sickness, political trouble.

Collectivization followed. By 1956 Zhou was working in mutual-aid teams and then in the cooperatives, and by 1958 the People’s Commune system reshaped daily life into work points, group labor, and grain accounting. Zhou was not a good planner, and the paperwork and meeting times slipped out of her head. She lost a work-point chit once and spent an afternoon searching the dirt floor with rising panic until her sister-in-law found it stuck in a sleeve.

The winter of 1959 hit hard. Grain shortages and procurement demands meant households ran short even when they worked every day. Zhou gathered wild greens when the ground thawed enough to pull them, then dried what she could. In 1960 she cut sweet-potato vines into thin strips and cooked them into watery porridge. When the family’s stores ran down, she borrowed from a neighbor and recorded the debt in her memory because she could not write it properly. She hated owing, and the shame sat on her chest until the debt was repaid.

During the Cultural Revolution, beginning in 1966, village life filled with political quarrels and shifting authority. Zhou kept her head down and stayed close to home. When young men marched past with armbands, she stepped into doorways and waited. She did not argue with anyone’s slogans. Her way of surviving was to be useful and unnoticeable. In those years she leaned on small routines: she rose early, swept the courtyard, and took a few minutes with her hands on the warm edge of the stove before anyone else woke. She enjoyed sunflower seeds when she could get them and saved a small handful for herself, cracking them quietly in the late afternoon.

Family deaths came in uneven waves. In 1955 her older brother 周德成 died at thirty-three, leaving his household short of labor just as collective work demands increased. Zhou’s older brother 周金山 died in 1969 at forty-nine, and Zhou helped his widow through the first weeks, cooking and sitting close at night when fear made sleep difficult. Her husband’s temper was not gentle, but Zhou did not meet anger with anger. She went silent, kept busy, and waited for it to pass.

The sharpest loss came in 1975. Her daughter 赵玉芬, twenty-two, died after a sudden illness. Zhou washed the bedding, cooked for the mourners, and then sat alone behind the house, staring at the dirt path until her sister 周秋芬 found her and pulled her back inside. After that year Zhou’s anxiety took clearer shape. She avoided the clinic unless forced. She checked doors and jars repeatedly. At night she replayed old scenes—boots in the lane, a child’s fever, an empty grain bin—until her chest tightened and she had to sit upright to breathe.

After 1978, rural reforms loosened the commune system. The household responsibility system and revived markets changed the rhythm of labor. Zhou liked the return of small autonomy: deciding when to weed, when to thresh, when to sell eggs. She never became a confident trader, but she took satisfaction in small cash earnings from vegetables and a few chickens. She kept a private habit of setting aside a tiny reserve of grain, wrapped and hidden, a practice she never discussed at meetings.

In 1985, at fifty-seven, decades of coal and biomass smoke in a poorly ventilated kitchen caught up with her. The cough started in winter and then stayed. Breathlessness made heavy fieldwork impossible. Cold air triggered wheezing, and during tense moments her breathing turned into panic, fast and shallow, until she sat still and waited for it to ease. She shifted to lighter tasks—sorting grain, feeding animals, minding a grandniece for an afternoon—and she took on more caregiving as relatives aged and fell ill. When her sister 周秀兰’s health declined in the late 1990s, Zhou spent long stretches in her house, cooking soft foods and washing clothes, then returning home exhausted.

赵长顺 died in 1996. Zhou did not remarry. Over time, with her daughter gone and her strength reduced, she moved into the household of her nephew 周志强 and his wife 李桂珍. She kept to a corner of the kang in winter and a stool by the doorway in summer, where she could watch the yard without being in the center of talk. She avoided noisy gatherings. She liked quiet visits with 李桂珍 while shelling beans, and she laughed once in a while when the younger women teased each other about whose pickles were too salty.

In December 2021, at ninety-three, Zhou suffered a stroke and its complications. She died on December 13, 2021, in the village where she had lived among extended kin.
