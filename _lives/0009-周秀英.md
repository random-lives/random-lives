#     incident: civilian_war_exposure
#   - age: 32
#     connection: Communal grain shortages and winter hunger force her to forage wild

#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 57
#     connection: Long-term smoke exposure culminates in chronic cough and breathlessness;

#   - age_range: 7-21 (1935-1949)
#     key_events:
#     - Japanese/Manchukuo control tightens locally; requisitions and policing become

#     - 'Great Leap Forward/commune period: food scarcity and borrowing; repeated foraging
#       becomes routine.'
#     - Only daughter dies at 22 (mid-1970s), reshaping Zhou’s role toward caregiving

#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Maintains a reputation for being 'reliable' but sometimes her household
#       goes without small advantages that neighbors quietly take.
#     scene: In collective accounting/communal grain distribution, she refuses to inflate
#       her household’s share or take extra from the threshing floor even when others
#       do.
#     timing: Adult life, especially 1950s–1960s
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (very high)
#   - consequence: Avoids open conflict and social retaliation, but is at risk of being
#       overburdened and quietly resentful.
#     scene: She yields in disputes over work assignments and mediates quarrels between
#       sisters-in-law by offering to take the less desirable chores.
#     timing: Adult life through old age
#     trait: Agreeableness (high)
#   - consequence: Less likely to become a team leader/cadre; depends on close kin ties
#       instead of broad social networks.
#     scene: At village meetings she stands at the back, speaks only when directly asked,
#       and prefers one-on-one talk while working rather than group banter.
#     timing: All phases; most visible in 1950s political meetings and later community
#       events
#     trait: Extraversion (very low)
#   - consequence: Household is more vulnerable during policy changes requiring forms/registrations;
#       she leans on more organized relatives.
#     scene: She is diligent in urgent, concrete tasks (feeding animals, cooking), but
#       struggles with long-term planning—misplaces coupons/tools, forgets meeting times,
#       and avoids paperwork.
#     timing: Adulthood and later adulthood
#     trait: Conscientiousness (very low)
#   - consequence: Adopts a few practical innovations (stove venting, new crops) that
#       modestly improve daily life.
#     scene: She is curious about new seeds/techniques and later listens attentively
#       to radio health advice, trying small changes while still keeping folk practices
#       privately.
#     timing: Reform era onward (late 1970s–1990s)
#     trait: Openness (moderately high)
#   - consequence: Sleep disturbance and avoidance reduce her participation in meetings/markets;
#       family interprets it as 'timid' or 'worrying too much,' limiting her access
#       to opportunities.
#     scene: She has persistent worry about raids, shortages, and illness; startles
#       easily at shouting/boots, avoids certain roads/official compounds, and experiences
#       episodes of breathless panic during tense encounters.
#     timing: Begins after occupation-era searches (late 1930s–1940s), flares during
#       famine (1959–61), persists into old age
#     trait: Anxiety disorder (must be visible)
# number_of_children: '1'
# number_of_siblings: '6'
# occupation: Peasant farmer / agricultural laborer (collective/household farming; primary
#   identity as farmer)
# religion: Household ancestral rites + folk deity offerings/prayers (festival-based;
#   mostly private/domestic)
# sibling_ages_at_death:

# - 54

# sibling_sexes:

# - M
# - M
# - M
# - F
# structured_incidents:
# - event: Around the Great Leap Forward famine years, her tenant-farmer household ran
#     short of grain after quotas and poor harvests, and she had to rely on wild greens/sweet-potato
#     vines and borrowing to get through the winter.
#   reasoning: Born landless/very poor and remaining low-standing, she likely experienced
#     at least one period of acute hardship, especially during the 1930s–40s turmoil
#     and 1959–61 famine-era disruptions.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: 1959–1961 (age 31–33)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: After decades of cooking and heating with coal/biomass in a poorly ventilated
#     rural home, she developed a long-term cough and breathlessness that limited heavy
#     fieldwork and worsened in cold seasons.
#   reasoning: Reaching old age in rural Northeast China with likely biomass/coal smoke
#     exposure and limited early-life healthcare makes chronic conditions (hypertension,
#     COPD/bronchitis, arthritis) very common well before the fatal stroke.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: from the late 50s onward, roughly 1985–2021 (age 57–93)
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: During the Japanese occupation (Manchukuo period), soldiers and police periodically
#     requisitioned grain and labor in her village area, and her family sometimes hid
#     food and kept children indoors during searches.
#   reasoning: Childhood in Liaoning during the Manchukuo/Japanese occupation and later
#     conflict makes direct civilian exposure (occupation pressures, requisitions, raids,
#     temporary flight) the most typical warfare pathway.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: mid-to-late 1930s–early 1940s (age 7–14)

周秀英 was born on April 20, 1928, in a village area outside Liaoyang in Liaoning. Her family were Han farmers who spoke the local Northeastern Mandarin of the plain, kept a small household altar, and marked Qingming and the New Year with incense and food set out for ancestors. When she was small, the region was governed through warlord politics and then, after 1931, by the Japanese-backed Manchukuo state, with police posts, grain levies, and forced labor orders reaching into villages.

She arrived as the sixth of seven children in a patrilocal extended household. Her father, 周福山, rented land and worked it for a share, then sold his labor when the season demanded. Her mother, known in the village as 周王氏, spun thread, mended clothing for other households, and carried eggs or cloth to market days when she could. The older children—an eldest sister born in 1914, another sister born in 1918, and three brothers born in 1920, 1922, and 1925—already filled the yard. A younger sister would be born in 1931.

In the mornings, Zhou Xiuing learned tasks by watching. She fetched water, kept an eye on a pot, and watched for the fire to catch. When her mother came home from market with a few small coins tied in a cloth, she counted them twice and hid them under a folded quilt. Zhou learned a handful of characters the same way she learned everything else: looking, then copying. She could recognize “rice,” “oil,” and the surnames painted on some shop boards, and she could match a character on a scrap of paper to one on a sack. Writing was harder. She could make a few strokes on a smoothed patch of dirt with a stick, then gave up and went back to work.

The first death in the household came early. In 1931, her eldest sister died at seventeen. The adults did not speak much in front of children, but Zhou heard the talk of cough and fever, and she watched the funeral ritual done with what the family could afford: paper offerings, a few bowls of food, and the long, weary visits from kin. After that year she startled easily at any sudden shout in the lane. At night she listened for footsteps outside, and in the day she scanned the road before she carried anything valuable.

The occupation years pressed down. From the mid-1930s into the early 1940s, soldiers and police came through the area at intervals. They demanded grain, labor, and information. Once, when Zhou was ten, she crouched with her younger sister, 周秋芬, behind a stack of cornstalks while her father and brothers hurried to shift a jar of sorghum into a pit and cover it with chaff. The children were kept indoors on days when searches were expected. Zhou learned to keep her hands still and her mouth shut when men in boots entered the courtyard. Even after they left, she could not stop her body from shaking. Her mother pushed a bowl of thin porridge toward her and told her to eat. Zhou ate, then hid part of her own portion in a cloth for later and worried she had been seen doing it.

By the time the war ended in 1945, she was seventeen and already strong from fieldwork. The Northeast then became a battleground in the civil war. Authority shifted in the county; slogans on walls changed; armed men came through in different uniforms. In those years she avoided travel unless she had to. When she did go to a market town, she stayed close to her mother or older sister, 周秀兰, and kept her eyes down. She talked little, even with people she knew. Her laughter came out in private, in the yard, when her younger sister made fun of the way a rooster strutted or when an aunt told a story about a neighbor who tried to water down his liquor and got caught.

At twenty-one, Zhou married 赵长顺 from a nearby village and moved to his family's yard. The marriage was arranged through relatives and matchmakers and settled with practical negotiations about bedding and grain. Her mother-in-law, 赵春花, ran the stove and the storage jars with firm hands. Zhou did not argue with her. She rose early, carried water, cooked, and went out to the fields with the men when needed. When village meetings began to pull everyone into new campaigns—land reform and then class-labeling—she stood at the back and listened. She spoke only when directly asked, then gave short answers.

Land reform came in the early years of her marriage. Meetings ran long, and the village sorted households into labels. Zhou's birth family had been tenants, and her husband's household was poor as well. There were public sessions, angry speeches, and confiscations in some places. Zhou kept her face still and went home to heat water and patch clothing. When she was sent to help tally grain or watch a storehouse, she refused offers to "take a little extra for the children." She handed things over by the measure, even when it meant her own household ate thinner porridge.

She gave birth to a daughter, 赵玉芬, in the fourth year of her marriage. Zhou's world narrowed to the rhythm of nursing, carrying, and work points. She tied the child on her back and went to the fields. When the child was small, Zhou saved the best bits of egg for her and took the broken pieces herself. Her daughter learned to read better than Zhou did, picking up characters in school and writing them on the ground with a stick; Zhou watched and asked her to read out loud the words she could not.

Collectivization arrived in the mid-1950s. Mutual-aid teams turned into cooperatives, then the People’s Commune. The work-point system dictated who ate what. Tools and animals were reorganized. Zhou struggled with the paperwork and the schedules and missed a meeting once because she mixed up the day; her mother-in-law scolded her for it. In the fields she worked hard in bursts, fast with her hands, but she misplaced small items—gloves, a sickle, a coupon—then grew agitated and searched the yard over and over until she found them.

The worst hunger came in 1959. Quotas stayed high while harvests fell, and the winter of 1959–1960 tightened the stomach. Zhou gathered wild greens from ditches and the edge of woods, and she stripped sweet-potato vines when she could get them. She traded sewing work for a bowl of millet at one household and borrowed grain from another, paying back later with labor. She hid a small sack behind the stove wall and checked it every few days, then checked again. Sleep came in fragments. A creak in the yard brought her upright, heart racing, certain someone had come for their food.

The Cultural Revolution began when Zhou was thirty-eight. Young men and women shouted slogans and inspected households. Village authority became uncertain, and clinics and schools were disrupted at different moments. Zhou kept religious practice inside the home: a small offering at New Year, a quiet bow at Qingming when the family went to the graves. She avoided the loudest gatherings and took comfort in repetitive tasks—kneading dough, trimming wicks, folding clothes. When her older brother 周德成 died in 1955 and later another brother 周金山 died in 1969, she went to help their households, cooking and watching children while others handled arrangements. Caregiving fit her; she did it without speeches.

Her daughter 赵玉芬 died at twenty-two. The family burned paper money and set out food at the grave, incense rising in the cold air. Zhou stopped speaking for long stretches. After that, she poured more of her time into other people's needs: an ill in-law one year, a nephew's newborn another, an aging relative who needed meals brought in winter. She still went to the fields when required, but she drifted away from village chatter and stayed home whenever she could.

Rural reforms after 1978 changed the village again. Responsibility returned to households, markets revived, and cash became more common. Zhou enjoyed a simple pleasure then: sitting on a low stool in the sun with her older sister 周秀兰 on a visit, shelling sunflower seeds and listening to radio news that she could not fully read herself. She liked steamed corn bread hot from the pot and saved the crisped bits from the bottom for herself.

By her late fifties a long cough took hold. Years of smoke from coal and crop-stalk fires in a poorly ventilated kitchen had left her short of breath. Winter made it worse. She wheezed after carrying water and had to stop halfway across the yard to steady herself. When she became anxious, the breathlessness tightened into panic; she would sit on the kang, press her hands to her knees, and wait for her chest to settle. Field labor became harder, and she shifted to lighter work—sorting beans, watching grandchildren of relatives, mending clothes—while younger adults took on the heaviest tasks.

Her husband 赵长顺 died when Zhou was sixty-eight. After the funeral, Zhou moved between relatives' houses more often, no longer anchored by a spouse or child. As her siblings died—周宝贵 first, then 周秀兰, then 周秋芬—her circle narrowed to nephews and nieces. She ended up living in the household of her nephew 周志强 and his wife 李桂珍, sharing their courtyard and eating at their table. She rose early out of habit, swept a small patch of ground, and folded her bedding neatly even when no one asked. She avoided crowded events and disliked sudden loud knocks at the gate.

At ninety-three, Zhou had a stroke and died from its complications in rural Liaoyang.
