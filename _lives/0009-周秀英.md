#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Maintains a reputation for being 'reliable' but sometimes her household
#       goes without small advantages that neighbors quietly take.
#     scene: In collective accounting/communal grain distribution, she refuses to inflate
#       her household’s share or take extra from the threshing floor even when others
#       do.
#     timing: Adult life, especially 1950s–1960s
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (very high)
#   - consequence: Avoids open conflict and social retaliation, but is at risk of being
#       overburdened and quietly resentful.
#     scene: She yields in disputes over work assignments and mediates quarrels between
#       sisters-in-law by offering to take the less desirable chores.
#     timing: Adult life through old age
#     trait: Agreeableness (high)
#   - consequence: Less likely to become a team leader/cadre; depends on close kin ties
#       instead of broad social networks.
#     scene: At village meetings she stands at the back, speaks only when directly asked,
#       and prefers one-on-one talk while working rather than group banter.
#     timing: All phases; most visible in 1950s political meetings and later community
#       events
#     trait: Extraversion (very low)
#   - consequence: Household is more vulnerable during policy changes requiring forms/registrations;
#       she leans on more organized relatives.
#     scene: She is diligent in urgent, concrete tasks (feeding animals, cooking), but
#       struggles with long-term planning—misplaces coupons/tools, forgets meeting times,
#       and avoids paperwork.
#     timing: Adulthood and later adulthood
#     trait: Conscientiousness (very low)
#   - consequence: Adopts a few practical innovations (stove venting, new crops) that
#       modestly improve daily life.
#     scene: She is curious about new seeds/techniques and later listens attentively
#       to radio health advice, trying small changes while still keeping folk practices
#       privately.
#     timing: Reform era onward (late 1970s–1990s)
#     trait: Openness (moderately high)
#   - consequence: Sleep disturbance and avoidance reduce her participation in meetings/markets;
#       family interprets it as 'timid' or 'worrying too much,' limiting her access
#       to opportunities.
#     scene: She has persistent worry about raids, shortages, and illness; startles
#       easily at shouting/boots, avoids certain roads/official compounds, and experiences
#       episodes of breathless panic during tense encounters.
#     timing: Begins after occupation-era searches (late 1930s–1940s), flares during
#       famine (1959–61), persists into old age
#     trait: Anxiety disorder (must be visible)
# number_of_children: '1'
# number_of_siblings: '6'
# occupation: Peasant farmer / agricultural laborer (collective/household farming; primary
#   identity as farmer)
# religion: Household ancestral rites + folk deity offerings/prayers (festival-based;
#   mostly private/domestic)
# sibling_ages_at_death:
# - 17
# - 83
# - 49

# - 54
# - 76
# sibling_sexes:

# - M
# - M
# - M
# - F
# structured_incidents:
# - event: Around the Great Leap Forward famine years, her tenant-farmer household ran
#     short of grain after quotas and poor harvests, and she had to rely on wild greens/sweet-potato
#     vines and borrowing to get through the winter.
#   reasoning: Born landless/very poor and remaining low-standing, she likely experienced
#     at least one period of acute hardship, especially during the 1930s–40s turmoil
#     and 1959–61 famine-era disruptions.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: 1959–1961 (age 31–33)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: After decades of cooking and heating with coal/biomass in a poorly ventilated
#     rural home, she developed a long-term cough and breathlessness that limited heavy
#     fieldwork and worsened in cold seasons.
#   reasoning: Reaching old age in rural Northeast China with likely biomass/coal smoke
#     exposure and limited early-life healthcare makes chronic conditions (hypertension,
#     COPD/bronchitis, arthritis) very common well before the fatal stroke.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: from the late 50s onward, roughly 1985–2021 (age 57–93)
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: During the Japanese occupation (Manchukuo period), soldiers and police periodically
#     requisitioned grain and labor in her village area, and her family sometimes hid
#     food and kept children indoors during searches.
#   reasoning: Childhood in Liaoning during the Manchukuo/Japanese occupation and later
#     conflict makes direct civilian exposure (occupation pressures, requisitions, raids,
#     temporary flight) the most typical warfare pathway.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: mid-to-late 1930s–early 1940s (age 7–14)

Zhou Xiuying was born on April 20, 1928, in the countryside outside Liaoyang in Liaoning, in a Han village where people spoke the local Northeastern Mandarin and measured security by grain in the storage jar. The area sat under the shifting control of warlords and then, by the time she was three, under the Japanese-backed Manchukuo state. In her family’s yard the visible order came from elders and the ancestral tablets set high on a shelf; the larger order arrived as uniforms, requisitions, and new rules.

She entered a crowded patrilocal household. Her father, Zhou Fushan, rented land and worked it as a tenant, taking day labor when there was no contract. Her mother, known in the village as Zhou Wangshi, kept a needle moving whenever she could: mending padded jackets, stitching soles, sewing for neighbors who paid in millet or a few coins. Xiuying was the sixth child; she grew up with three older brothers—Zhou Jinshan, Zhou Decheng, Zhou Baogui—and two older sisters, Zhou’s eldest girl and then Zhou Xiulan. A younger sister, Zhou Qiufen, came three years later. The household stayed poor and tense about food. Xiuying learned early to eat without lingering and to stop talking when her grandfather cleared his throat.

She held on to small routines. In the mornings she swept the kang platform, folded quilts, and watched her mother roll dough thin for noodles when there was flour. She liked the smell of toasted soybean flour and would lick it off her fingers when no one looked. Her mother taught her a handful of characters for practical use—numbers, “rice,” “salt,” “oil”—so she could recognize a shop sign and not be cheated at the market. Writing never became a skill; she could copy a character slowly with a stub of brush, then forget the strokes the next day.

When Xiuying was seven, men from the occupation administration and local police began appearing more often. They came in boots, with papers and demands: grain, labor, sometimes a cart and donkey. In the late 1930s her family kept a shallow pit in the yard covered with straw and hard-packed earth. On days when word came that a search was coming, Xiuying helped her mother pour grain into sacks and lower them into the pit, then scatter chaff over the spot. Children were told to stay inside and keep quiet. Xiuying listened for the scrape of soles and the sharp voice of men calling out. Even after they left, she kept her shoulders tight, waiting for the next knock.

In 1931 her eldest sister died at seventeen. The household kept working, but the rituals changed that year. At New Year they set out a small bowl of millet porridge for the ancestors and lit incense, and Xiuying watched her mother whisper the dead girl’s name. The loss settled into Xiuying’s habits: she checked on sleeping children more than other girls did, and she startled easily at raised voices.

The war years stretched on. Xiuying entered adolescence during shortages and control. She avoided the busier parts of the market and preferred to stand near the vegetable baskets with her younger sister Qiufen, counting coppers and watching for trouble. She trusted one friend outside the family, a girl from a neighboring lane named Sun Yulan, and they shared small jokes while gathering firewood—who had the loudest snoring uncle, whose mother-in-law would be the worst. Xiuying laughed quietly, then looked over her shoulder as if laughter drew attention.

After 1945 the Japanese were gone, but the Northeast became a battlefield in the civil war. Authority flipped and flipped again. Meetings were called; young men were mobilized; levy demands shifted. Xiuying stayed close to home and did what her parents told her, but the worry became physical. She woke at night with her heart racing and sat upright listening, then lay down again and counted breaths until morning.

In 1949, after the Communist victory in the region, she married Zhao Changshun from a nearby village and moved into his family’s yard. The marriage was practical. Changshun worked hard and spoke little. His mother, Zhao Chunhua, kept control of the kitchen and grain jar, and Xiuying learned to step around her moods. She fetched water, patched clothes, and carried manure baskets to the fields. She did not argue when work was assigned; if someone needed help, she offered it quickly and then regretted it later when her back ached.

Land reform arrived as meetings and labels. Cadres read out class status, and households were discussed in public. Xiuying sat at the back with other women, eyes on the floor, hands folded in her lap. She brought home what she heard in fragments and let Changshun deal with the details. When redistribution came, it eased some immediate pressure, but the household remained short on everything: cloth, oil, money for medicine.

Her only child, a daughter named Zhao Yufen, was born in 1953. Xiuying nursed her and kept her warm inside the quilted bundle on the kang. She liked watching Yufen chew on a steamed bun, cheeks puffed, and she saved the whitest flour for the child when she could. On the shelf above the kang Xiuying kept a small image of Guanyin wrapped in cloth; at New Year and on the fifteenth day she set out a saucer with a few peanuts and a cup of clear water, and she lit incense when the house was quiet.

Collectivization reshaped the village by the mid-1950s. Work teams formed, then cooperatives, then the People’s Commune. Xiuying went out with the women to weed and harvest, earning work points, and returned to cook, mend, and feed chickens. Paperwork and schedules never stuck in her head. She forgot meeting times and misplaced coupons. When she needed to deliver something to the team leader, she asked Yufen to remind her.

The winters of 1959, 1960, and 1961 broke the household’s confidence in food. Quotas and poor harvests left the commune short. Xiuying picked wild greens along ditches and stripped sweet-potato vines when she could find them, then boiled them down with salt. She borrowed grain from a relative and repaid it in labor, scrubbing clothes and helping with threshing when her arms already felt empty. At night she lay awake counting the handfuls left in the jar and imagining the jar bottom.

The Cultural Revolution reached their area in 1966 with shouting, slogans, and struggle sessions. Xiuying kept her head down and spoke even less. She avoided the main road when groups marched, taking the back paths along fields instead. At home she continued ancestor offerings in a private way, putting a small bowl of food at the shelf and clearing it before visitors arrived. She argued once with a neighbor about borrowed flour, then apologized the next day and brought a handful of dried beans to smooth it over.

Family deaths piled into her middle years. Zhou Decheng, her older brother, died in 1955 at thirty-three, and the news arrived without explanation. Zhou Jinshan died in 1969, leaving his family short-handed. Xiuying took turns helping his widow during busy seasons, cooking and watching children while others worked. Her daughter grew into a young woman, quick and capable, and Xiuying leaned on her in ways she did not admit.

In 1975 Zhao Yufen died at twenty-two. The household held the funeral rites with paper money burned in a metal basin and incense smoke drifting out into the yard. Xiuying continued to speak her daughter’s name in the kitchen when no one else was there, as if reminding herself of the sound. After that, she poured her effort into other people’s needs—an ailing in-law, a niece’s newborn, an elderly neighbor who needed porridge carried over.

Rural reforms after 1978 changed the work again. The commune loosened; households managed their own plots. Small markets revived. Xiuying sold a few eggs at the market and sometimes bartered mended clothes for vegetables. She listened to radio programs when the family acquired one, picking up simple health advice and household tips. She disliked crowded stalls and would buy quickly, then stand off to the side until her companion finished.

By 1985, at fifty-seven, she carried a cough that did not leave. The breathlessness came in winter and during hard work. Smoke from coal and crop stalks had filled her lungs for decades, and now heavy field labor made her stop and squat, hand on her knee, waiting to breathe normally. She shifted to lighter tasks: feeding animals, sorting beans, watching children, peeling vegetables. Her worry tightened when her chest felt tight; she had episodes of panic where she feared she could not draw air, and she avoided walking far from home alone.

Her husband Zhao Changshun died in 1996. Widowhood narrowed her world. She moved between relatives’ courtyards until she settled with extended kin, in the household of her nephew Zhou Zhiqiang and his wife Li Guizhen. She helped with what she could—shelling corn, folding dumplings, telling a grandchild to wipe his feet before stepping onto the kang. She took quiet satisfaction in a clean stove area and neatly stacked firewood. Loud arguments annoyed her; she would retreat to the edge of the yard, sit on a low stool, and watch the chickens scratch.

Old age brought more limitations. Her hearing dulled and she asked people to repeat themselves. The cough remained, worse in cold months. She kept up the simple offerings: on Qingming she asked to be taken to the graves, carrying paper money and a small bottle of liquor to pour on the earth. At home she burned incense for her parents, her husband, and her daughter, setting out steamed buns or a few slices of apple when they were available.

On December 13, 2021, Zhou Xiuying suffered a stroke and died in her relatives’ home in rural Liaoning. Her body was washed and dressed, incense was lit, and paper offerings were burned before burial in the family grave area with food set out for her spirit and the ancestors.
