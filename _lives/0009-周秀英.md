#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 10
#     connection: During occupation-era requisition searches, the family hides grain

#     incident: civilian_war_exposure
#   - age: 32
#     connection: Communal grain shortages and winter hunger force her to forage wild
#       greens and borrow; reinforces her habit of hoarding small reserves and worrying
#       about food security.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 57
#     connection: Long-term smoke exposure culminates in chronic cough and breathlessness;
#       reduces work-points/earning capacity and nudges her into more home-based roles
#       and dependence on kin.
#     incident: chronic_illness
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6 (1928-1934)

#   - age_range: 7-21 (1935-1949)
#     key_events:
#     - Japanese/Manchukuo control tightens locally; requisitions and policing become
#       part of village life.
#     - Teen years dominated by work (fuel gathering, childcare, field tasks); semi-literacy

#       laborer and household manager.
#     - 'Great Leap Forward/commune period: food scarcity and borrowing; repeated foraging
#       becomes routine.'
#     - Only daughter dies at 22 (mid-1970s), reshaping Zhou’s role toward caregiving
#       for kin rather than descendants.

#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Maintains a reputation for being 'reliable' but sometimes her household
#       goes without small advantages that neighbors quietly take.
#     scene: In collective accounting/communal grain distribution, she refuses to inflate
#       her household’s share or take extra from the threshing floor even when others
#       do.
#     timing: Adult life, especially 1950s–1960s
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (very high)
#   - consequence: Avoids open conflict and social retaliation, but is at risk of being
#       overburdened and quietly resentful.
#     scene: She yields in disputes over work assignments and mediates quarrels between
#       sisters-in-law by offering to take the less desirable chores.
#     timing: Adult life through old age
#     trait: Agreeableness (high)
#   - consequence: Less likely to become a team leader/cadre; depends on close kin ties
#       instead of broad social networks.
#     scene: At village meetings she stands at the back, speaks only when directly asked,
#       and prefers one-on-one talk while working rather than group banter.
#     timing: All phases; most visible in 1950s political meetings and later community
#       events
#     trait: Extraversion (very low)
#   - consequence: Household is more vulnerable during policy changes requiring forms/registrations;
#       she leans on more organized relatives.
#     scene: She is diligent in urgent, concrete tasks (feeding animals, cooking), but
#       struggles with long-term planning—misplaces coupons/tools, forgets meeting times,
#       and avoids paperwork.
#     timing: Adulthood and later adulthood
#     trait: Conscientiousness (very low)
#   - consequence: Adopts a few practical innovations (stove venting, new crops) that
#       modestly improve daily life.
#     scene: She is curious about new seeds/techniques and later listens attentively
#       to radio health advice, trying small changes while still keeping folk practices
#       privately.
#     timing: Reform era onward (late 1970s–1990s)
#     trait: Openness (moderately high)
#   - consequence: Sleep disturbance and avoidance reduce her participation in meetings/markets;
#       family interprets it as 'timid' or 'worrying too much,' limiting her access
#       to opportunities.
#     scene: She has persistent worry about raids, shortages, and illness; startles
#       easily at shouting/boots, avoids certain roads/official compounds, and experiences
#       episodes of breathless panic during tense encounters.
#     timing: Begins after occupation-era searches (late 1930s–1940s), flares during
#       famine (1959–61), persists into old age
#     trait: Anxiety disorder (must be visible)
# number_of_children: '1'
# number_of_siblings: '6'
# occupation: Peasant farmer / agricultural laborer (collective/household farming; primary
#   identity as farmer)
# religion: Household ancestral rites + folk deity offerings/prayers (festival-based;
#   mostly private/domestic)
# sibling_ages_at_death:
# - 17
# - 83
# - 49
# - 33
# - 54
# - 76
# sibling_sexes:
# - F
# - F
# - M
# - M
# - M
# - F
# structured_incidents:
# - event: Around the Great Leap Forward famine years, her tenant-farmer household ran
#     short of grain after quotas and poor harvests, and she had to rely on wild greens/sweet-potato
#     vines and borrowing to get through the winter.
#   reasoning: Born landless/very poor and remaining low-standing, she likely experienced
#     at least one period of acute hardship, especially during the 1930s–40s turmoil
#     and 1959–61 famine-era disruptions.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: 1959–1961 (age 31–33)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: After decades of cooking and heating with coal/biomass in a poorly ventilated
#     rural home, she developed a long-term cough and breathlessness that limited heavy
#     fieldwork and worsened in cold seasons.
#   reasoning: Reaching old age in rural Northeast China with likely biomass/coal smoke
#     exposure and limited early-life healthcare makes chronic conditions (hypertension,
#     COPD/bronchitis, arthritis) very common well before the fatal stroke.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: from the late 50s onward, roughly 1985–2021 (age 57–93)
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: During the Japanese occupation (Manchukuo period), soldiers and police periodically
#     requisitioned grain and labor in her village area, and her family sometimes hid
#     food and kept children indoors during searches.
#   reasoning: Childhood in Liaoning during the Manchukuo/Japanese occupation and later
#     conflict makes direct civilian exposure (occupation pressures, requisitions, raids,
#     temporary flight) the most typical warfare pathway.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: mid-to-late 1930s–early 1940s (age 7–14)
#   type: civilian_war_exposure

周秀英 was born on April 20, 1928, in a farming village in the Liaoyang area of Liaoning. Her family were Han people who spoke the local Northeastern Mandarin of the countryside. The region sat under the collapsing Republic’s rule in name, then under Japanese power after 1931, and the village learned to take orders from whoever arrived with paper seals and rifles.

She entered a crowded courtyard household. Her father, 周福山, worked rented land and bargained with landlords and grain agents. Her mother, 周王氏, kept the home together and earned small cash by sewing soles onto cloth shoes and taking mending from neighbors. Zhou was the sixth child of seven. Two older sisters came first, then three older brothers, then Zhou, then a younger sister. In winter, the kang stayed warm only when there was fuel; the children rotated places closest to the heat, elbows and feet pressed together.

In 1931, her oldest sister died at seventeen. The family burned paper and set out bowls for the spirit, then returned to the next day’s work. Zhou was three. She remembered the grown-ups’ voices lowering when they spoke the girl’s name, and she learned to watch faces for signs of bad news.

By the mid-1930s the Japanese-backed Manchukuo state reached into village life. In 1938, when Zhou was ten, soldiers and police came looking for grain and labor. Her father dug a shallow pit beneath stacked sorghum stalks and covered it with chaff; her mother pushed the younger children behind sacks and told them not to cough. Zhou sat with her back against the wall, listening for boots in the yard. When she later walked a road and heard sharp voices behind her, her stomach tightened and her breath sped up. It happened without her choosing it.

She went to a small village class for a short time. She learned a few characters—numbers, common surnames, the words on a shop sign—but she never wrote comfortably. At home she could read enough to recognize a label on a medicine packet or a notice pasted at the team office. When the teacher asked questions, she stared down at the desk. She preferred copying quietly to speaking. At thirteen she stopped going and followed her mother to gather fuel and weed fields. She carried water in buckets with a shoulder pole until her collarbones ached.

In 1945, the war ended and the Japanese left. Armies moved through the Northeast. The village heard new slogans, then different ones. Zhou was seventeen and spent her days in the fields, but politics reached her through meetings that filled the schoolyard. She stood at the edge. When asked to speak, she answered in short sentences and sat down quickly. In 1949, the new state’s cadres arrived with registers and demands for attendance. That year, Zhou married 赵长顺 from a nearby village and moved into his family’s courtyard. She brought bedding, a few pieces of clothing, and the habits of a tenant household that counted every scoop of grain.

In 1951, land reform reached her area. Work teams held meetings, labeled households, and divided property. Zhou listened more than she spoke. She did not take extra when grain or tools were handed out; she took what the list said and carried it home. Her mother-in-law, 赵春花, ran the kitchen with a sharp voice and watched Zhou’s hands for wasted flour. Zhou answered softly and kept moving. When her anxiety surged, she found a task—scrubbing a pot, cutting fodder, sorting beans—until her pulse slowed.

In 1953, her daughter was born. They named her 赵玉芬. Zhou carried the baby on her back while she worked. She found small pleasures that did not cost money: the first cucumbers from a kitchen plot, hot water poured into a chipped bowl on cold mornings, sitting on the low doorstep to pick stones from grain. She laughed most with her younger sister, 周秋芬, when they met at market days; they teased each other about whose dumplings leaked and whose rooster stole millet.

From 1955 to 1958, the village reorganized into cooperatives and then a People’s Commune. Labor was counted in work points. Meetings multiplied. Zhou avoided the front rows and watched others argue. She did the assigned work—transplanting seedlings, hauling manure, cutting fodder—then went home to cook. She misplaced a coupon booklet once and tore up the bedding searching for it, hands trembling, her throat tight. When she found it wedged under a bowl, she sat on the kang and shook for a long time.

In 1959, the grain ran out. The commune took quotas and the harvest failed. Zhou saved millet husks and ground them with wild greens. She steamed sweet-potato vines into a thick mash and carried it to the field in a tin. When her daughter cried from hunger, Zhou took her to a neighbor with a little more grain and borrowed a bowl, promising labor in return. That winter she kept a small sack hidden behind the stove and checked it each evening, fingertips digging into the grain as if it could vanish by morning.

In 1966, the Cultural Revolution began. The village’s loudest men became louder. Schools and clinics shifted hands. Zhou kept her head down and followed directions. Her husband attended meetings; she asked him what was said and he waved her off. When slogans were shouted in the lane at night, she lay awake, heart beating fast, listening until the yard fell quiet.

Deaths in her birth family continued to thin the line. In 1969, her older brother 周金山 died at forty-nine. In 1975, her daughter died at twenty-two. The illness was fast and the village clinic had little. Zhou washed her daughter’s body and folded the clothes with careful hands. After the funeral she returned to the fields, but her movements changed. She began to check the door latch more than once. She avoided walking past the brigade office if she did not have to.

After 1978, reforms reached the countryside. Land and responsibility shifted back to households. Markets revived. Zhou began selling small things again—eggs when there were eggs, a little homemade pickled cabbage, stitched shoe soles like her mother had done. She counted money slowly and tucked it into a cloth pouch inside her jacket. She trusted few people with it. One person she did trust was a neighbor woman, 李桂珍, who shared gossip and traded small favors. They sat together in late afternoons, shelling beans and speaking in low voices. Zhou smiled more then.

In 1985, her body stopped cooperating. The cough started as a winter cough and stayed. Breathlessness came with carrying water and later with walking uphill. She had spent decades cooking and heating with smoky coal and crop stalks in a tight kitchen. Now she had to rest after short tasks. She gave up the heaviest fieldwork and focused on feeding animals, minding grandchildren of relatives, and tending small plots close to home. When she got short of breath, anxiety rose with it; she sat with both hands on her knees, eyes fixed on the ground, waiting for air to come.

Her husband, 赵长顺, died in 1996. Widowhood brought a new kind of dependence. Without living children, Zhou leaned on her siblings’ families. Her older sister 周秀兰, still alive then, sent small help and advice until her death in 2001. Zhou’s younger sister died in 2007. By the 2010s, Zhou lived in the household of her nephew 周志强 and his wife 李桂珍. She slept in a small room off the main kang, rose early, and folded her bedding into a neat stack. She watched the yard and listened to the radio at low volume, catching weather forecasts and health talks she half understood.

In December 2021, at ninety-three, Zhou suffered a stroke. She died on December 13, 2021, in the Liaoyang countryside where she had been born, after a life spent inside the routines of farming households and the long political turns of Northeast China.
