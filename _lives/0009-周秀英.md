#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Maintains a reputation for being 'reliable' but sometimes her household
#       goes without small advantages that neighbors quietly take.
#     scene: In collective accounting/communal grain distribution, she refuses to inflate
#       her household’s share or take extra from the threshing floor even when others
#       do.
#     timing: Adult life, especially 1950s–1960s
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (very high)
#   - consequence: Avoids open conflict and social retaliation, but is at risk of being
#       overburdened and quietly resentful.
#     scene: She yields in disputes over work assignments and mediates quarrels between
#       sisters-in-law by offering to take the less desirable chores.
#     timing: Adult life through old age
#     trait: Agreeableness (high)
#   - consequence: Less likely to become a team leader/cadre; depends on close kin ties
#       instead of broad social networks.
#     scene: At village meetings she stands at the back, speaks only when directly asked,
#       and prefers one-on-one talk while working rather than group banter.
#     timing: All phases; most visible in 1950s political meetings and later community
#       events
#     trait: Extraversion (very low)
#   - consequence: Household is more vulnerable during policy changes requiring forms/registrations;
#       she leans on more organized relatives.
#     scene: She is diligent in urgent, concrete tasks (feeding animals, cooking), but
#       struggles with long-term planning—misplaces coupons/tools, forgets meeting times,
#       and avoids paperwork.
#     timing: Adulthood and later adulthood
#     trait: Conscientiousness (very low)
#   - consequence: Adopts a few practical innovations (stove venting, new crops) that
#       modestly improve daily life.
#     scene: She is curious about new seeds/techniques and later listens attentively
#       to radio health advice, trying small changes while still keeping folk practices
#       privately.
#     timing: Reform era onward (late 1970s–1990s)
#     trait: Openness (moderately high)
#   - consequence: Sleep disturbance and avoidance reduce her participation in meetings/markets;
#       family interprets it as 'timid' or 'worrying too much,' limiting her access
#       to opportunities.
#     scene: She has persistent worry about raids, shortages, and illness; startles
#       easily at shouting/boots, avoids certain roads/official compounds, and experiences
#       episodes of breathless panic during tense encounters.
#     timing: Begins after occupation-era searches (late 1930s–1940s), flares during
#       famine (1959–61), persists into old age
#     trait: Anxiety disorder (must be visible)
# number_of_children: '1'
# number_of_siblings: '6'
# occupation: Peasant farmer / agricultural laborer (collective/household farming; primary
#   identity as farmer)
# religion: Household ancestral rites + folk deity offerings/prayers (festival-based;
#   mostly private/domestic)
# sibling_ages_at_death:
# - 17
# - 83
# - 49

# - 54

# - M
# - M
# - F
# structured_incidents:
# - event: Around the Great Leap Forward famine years, her tenant-farmer household ran
#     short of grain after quotas and poor harvests, and she had to rely on wild greens/sweet-potato
#     vines and borrowing to get through the winter.
#   reasoning: Born landless/very poor and remaining low-standing, she likely experienced
#     at least one period of acute hardship, especially during the 1930s–40s turmoil
#     and 1959–61 famine-era disruptions.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: 1959–1961 (age 31–33)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: After decades of cooking and heating with coal/biomass in a poorly ventilated
#     rural home, she developed a long-term cough and breathlessness that limited heavy
#     fieldwork and worsened in cold seasons.
#   reasoning: Reaching old age in rural Northeast China with likely biomass/coal smoke
#     exposure and limited early-life healthcare makes chronic conditions (hypertension,
#     COPD/bronchitis, arthritis) very common well before the fatal stroke.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: from the late 50s onward, roughly 1985–2021 (age 57–93)
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: During the Japanese occupation (Manchukuo period), soldiers and police periodically
#     requisitioned grain and labor in her village area, and her family sometimes hid
#     food and kept children indoors during searches.
#   reasoning: Childhood in Liaoning during the Manchukuo/Japanese occupation and later
#     conflict makes direct civilian exposure (occupation pressures, requisitions, raids,
#     temporary flight) the most typical warfare pathway.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: mid-to-late 1930s–early 1940s (age 7–14)

周秀英 was born on April 20, 1928, in a village area outside Liaoyang in Liaoning, on the flat land where fields ran up to low woods and creek beds. Her family were Han farmers who spoke the local Northeastern Mandarin. When she was small, the region fell under the Japanese-backed Manchukuo state. Police posts, grain checks, and labor demands became part of the seasons as surely as planting and threshing.

She entered a crowded household. Her father, 周福山, rented land and paid with grain and labor. Her mother, 周王氏, kept a needle always close, sewing and mending for neighbors for a little cash or a bowl of millet. Zhou was the sixth child. Her oldest sister had been born in 1914 and carried herself like a second mother until she died in 1931 at seventeen, a loss that settled into the house like a rule: keep children near, keep food hidden, do not invite attention. The second sister, 周秀兰, born in 1918, lived long and steady. Three brothers followed—周金山 (1920), 周德成 (1922), 周宝贵 (1925)—and then Zhou, and then the youngest sister, 周秋芬, born in 1931.

Zhou learned early to keep her hands moving. She shelled beans by the doorway so she could watch the lane. She carried water in winter when the ground was slick, careful and slow, and she hated being hurried. She stayed quiet around strangers. In the evenings, when her mother counted coppers from sewing work, Zhou traced simple characters on the kang table with a wet finger—numbers, the common words on sacks and shop signs. She could recognize them, but she did not write letters.

By the mid-to-late 1930s, occupation policies reached into the village more sharply. Men in uniforms came through, looking for grain, for pigs, for labor. Once, when Zhou was ten, her father and brothers dug a shallow pit under the edge of the sorghum stack and lowered a jar of grain into it, sealing it with chaff. During searches, children stayed inside with the door bar set. Zhou sat on the bed with her youngest sister and listened to boots and voices outside. After that, she startled easily at sudden shouting. She avoided the road that led past the police post even when it was the shortest way to the market.

She grew into adolescence doing women’s work and field work together: weeding, carrying manure, cutting fodder, feeding a few chickens, then washing clothes in cold water until her hands cracked. She liked the hour just before sunrise, when the yard was still and she could light the stove without being watched. She also liked cracked sunflower seeds, eaten slowly, saving a few for her younger sister. With 周秋芬 she could talk in short sentences and laugh quietly. They teased each other about who could sew a straighter seam, and they competed over how many bundles of wild greens they could gather.

In 1945, the Japanese authority collapsed and the Northeast shifted again. Armed men passed through; different flags appeared; village meetings multiplied. Zhou was seventeen and watched adults trade rumors and warnings. Her brothers were pulled into mobilizations and labor demands. In 1949, at twenty-one, she married 赵长顺 from a nearby village and moved into his family’s courtyard. She carried her bedding roll and a few bowls. The marriage was practical and tense at first. Her mother-in-law, 赵春花, ran the kitchen and watched Zhou’s hands for waste or slowness. Zhou spoke little, nodded, and did the tasks she was given, but she lost small items—scissors, a ration slip, a sickle—and then searched with tight breathing until she found them. At night she replayed conversations in her head and waited for knocks on the door.

The early 1950s brought land reform and class labeling. Meetings were held in the village, names read out, families put into categories that mattered for grain, work roles, and safety. Zhou attended, standing behind other women. She did not speak unless a cadre pointed at her. At home she made offerings quietly on festival days: a bowl of food set near the family tablets, incense lit when the wind was right, and a whispered request for protection. Publicly she kept her head down.

In 1953 she gave birth to a daughter, 赵玉芬. The baby was small but loud, and Zhou felt relief in having one person in the house who depended on her alone. She carried the child on her back while working. She taught her daughter the characters she knew by pointing them out on matchboxes and on the side of the oil jar.

Collectivization arrived in the mid-1950s. Mutual-aid teams became cooperatives, then the People’s Commune. Work points decided grain. Zhou did field labor and also cooked for work teams at peak season. She struggled with schedules and meetings; she would forget a time, then arrive late and stand apart, sweating through her jacket even in cold weather. She avoided arguing about points. If someone accused her household of taking more than its share, she turned red, shook her head, and insisted on returning it. That insistence earned trust from some neighbors and irritation from her husband when grain was short.

The Great Leap Forward years hit hard. In 1959, when Zhou was thirty-one, the commune took grain quotas after poor harvests. Winter came early and stayed. Zhou cut sweet-potato vines and dried them. She and 周秋芬 walked to the edge of the woods for wild greens and roots. She borrowed grain from a better-off household with the promise of repayment after the next harvest, counting out the measure carefully and writing nothing down, trusting memory and fear to hold the debt in place. Nights were worse. She woke often, heart racing, and listened for any sign that someone would come demanding grain that did not exist.

In 1966, the Cultural Revolution reached the countryside. Loudspeakers, meetings, struggle sessions, and new committees changed who had power in the village. Zhou stayed out of the way. She avoided the main square when crowds gathered, choosing back lanes and field paths. Her husband was pulled into political work teams at times. Zhou kept the household functioning, made sure older relatives were fed, and tried to keep her daughter focused on daily tasks when schooling became irregular.

Her brothers’ lives narrowed too. 周德成 died in 1955 at thirty-three, before the hardest shortages, and his absence left fewer hands in the wider kin network. 周金山 died in 1969 at forty-nine, and Zhou spent weeks helping his widow wash clothes, cook, and manage funeral obligations. Caregiving fit her better than public life. She could sit beside a sickbed, change cloths, and keep a fire going without speaking much.

In 1975, her daughter 赵玉芬 died at twenty-two. The death came quickly and left Zhou unsteady in a way her family could not fix with scolding or work. She stopped going to the market for months. She avoided the path past the clinic. When her chest tightened, she held the edge of the kang and breathed in short pulls until it passed. She poured effort into caring for others in the Zhao household instead—nieces and nephews by marriage, an elderly in-law—tasks that filled the day and kept her from sitting alone.

After 1978, rural reforms reshaped work. The household responsibility system returned plots to family management. Small markets revived. Zhou grew older into a routine of early rising, sweeping the yard, feeding chickens, and picking through vegetables for sale. She preferred selling eggs because it required less shouting. She trusted one market woman, a neighbor named 韩桂芝, and they stood together at the edge of the stall line, exchanging quiet comments and occasional jokes about whose radishes were more crooked.

By 1985, at fifty-seven, the smoke from decades of coal and biomass stoves caught up with her. She developed a chronic cough and breathlessness that worsened in winter. On cold mornings, walking to the field made her stop and bend forward with hands on knees. She shifted to lighter work—sorting grain, watching children, mending clothes—while younger relatives did the heavy carrying.

Her husband 赵长顺 died in 1996. Widowhood changed the household balance. Zhou moved between relatives for short stays until one line of kin made a stable place for her. In the late 1990s she began living with her nephew 周志强 and his wife 李桂珍 in their compound. She kept her own corner of the kang and insisted on washing her own bowl. She still made small offerings on festival days, lighting incense when the courtyard was quiet.

Old age brought more breathlessness and then the slow narrowing of movement. She sat in the sun by the south wall, cracking sunflower seeds and spitting shells neatly into a tin. She listened to the radio for weather reports and worried aloud about sudden cold snaps even when grain was plentiful. In winter she avoided stepping outside when the ground iced over, after one slip that left her bruised and shaken for days.

On December 13, 2021, in rural Liaoyang, Zhou秀英 suffered a severe stroke. Her family got her to medical care, but complications followed. She died the same day at ninety-three.
