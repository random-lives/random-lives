#     name: Bo
#     narrative_role: 'Dry-field farmer; strict about work rhythms and obligations to

#       learns farming discipline but also learns how to bend rules quietly. Dies when
#       Ren is ~33, shortly before/around the storage-theft period, leaving Ren as primary
#       household decision-maker.'

#   - death_year: -944
#     name: Jia
#     narrative_role: 'Household laborer (childcare, food processing, hemp textiles,
#       seasonal fieldwork). Relationship is warm but anxious: she soothes conflict
#       and pushes Ren toward peace-making and public propriety. Her later death (Ren
#       ~45) amplifies his sense of insecurity and contributes to a harsher edge in
#       disputes.'
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: -972
#     name: Paternal grandmother (unnamed in household memory)
#     narrative_role: Lived nearby rather than in the same house; occasional childcare
#       and ritual instruction (offerings, taboo days). Relationship is respectful but
#       not intimate; her death is one of Ren’s first clear memories of funeral obligations.
#     role: paternal grandmother (nearby household)
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Maternal uncle (called 'Uncle of Jia')
#     narrative_role: Not a caretaker but an occasional source of seed grain/introductions;
#       appears during the drought spell as a link to wider kin support networks.
#     role: maternal kin contact
#   children:
#   - birth_year: -968
#     death_age: 70
#     death_year: -898
#     name: Lan
#     narrative_role: Eldest child; marries out but remains emotionally close to her
#       mother and brings news/support. She is the one who can speak frankly to Ren
#       in old age and helps negotiate help for her younger siblings’ households.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -966
#     death_age: 69
#     death_year: -897
#     name: Hao
#     narrative_role: 'Eldest son and eventual household successor; stays patrilocal,

#     death_year: -942
#     name: Xia
#     narrative_role: Third child; dies young (likely illness/childbirth-adjacent risk
#       though unspecified). Her death concentrates Ren’s attention on the surviving
#       children and increases Wei’s grief; it also heightens household anxiety and
#       ritual activity.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -960
#     death_age: 48
#     death_year: -912
#     name: Jun
#     narrative_role: Younger son; more independent and prone to arguments with Ren,
#       possibly leaving briefly to work elsewhere before returning. His midlife death
#       later leaves a gap and helps explain why the end-of-life household is a stem
#       family with Hao rather than a larger joint household.
#     sex: M
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 33
#     connection: Occurs after father’s decline/death period and as Ren’s household
#       stores increase; triggers stricter storage practices, boundary vigilance, and
#       more reliance on elders for dispute handling.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 42
#     connection: Builds on years of boundary tension exacerbated by earlier theft and
#       periodic scarcity; leads to compensation settlement that strains household resources
#       and shapes Ren’s later caution and reputation.
#     incident: homicide
#   - age: 53
#     connection: Happens after mother’s death and daughter’s young death, when Ren
#       is more reactive; also reflects ongoing competition over grazing/seedlings in
#       a landscape where livestock and fields intermix.
#     incident: physical_assault_perp
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6
#     key_events:
#     - Learns household rites and seasonal rhythms; first memories include a grandparent
#       funeral and communal sacrifices at a local shrine.
#     - A flooding/waterlogging year damages some fields and spoils stored grain; family
#       tightens rations and leans on nearby kin.
#     - Begins small chores (watching birds off seed plots, carrying water) under mother’s
#       close supervision.
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 7-17
#     key_events:
#     - 'Multi-year drought spell during late childhood/early teens: reduced millet
#       yields, fodder shortage, and tense seed-saving decisions; Ren learns the household’s
#       dependence on local elite schedules and grain loans.'
#     - Apprentices into adult field tasks (plowing assistance, harvesting, threshing)
#       and learns boundary markers and village dispute norms.
#     - 'Develops social reputation: quiet, polite, and likable in gatherings (high
#       agreeableness), yet prone to taking small advantages when unobserved (low honesty-humility).'
#     phase: Later childhood / adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-32
#     key_events:
#     - Marriage to Wei (-970) and establishment of an independent nuclear household
#       near parents; first children born in quick succession (-968, -966, -963, -960).
#     - Periodic livestock disease episode reduces piglet survival and manure supply;
#       household pivots to careful fodder use and tighter penning.
#     - Younger brother Shun’s death (-961) increases Ren’s labor burden and responsibilities
#       toward aging parents; Ren’s role in village work groups grows.
#     phase: Young adulthood
#   - age_range: 33-55
#     key_events:
#     - 'Father Bo dies (-956): Ren becomes primary decision-maker and negotiator with
#       village elders and local elite agents.'
#     - Storage theft incident (age 33–34) hardens Ren’s suspicion of neighbors and
#       pushes him to strengthen storage/alliances.
#     - 'Homicide during boundary dispute (age 41–42): mediated settlement with compensation;
#       enduring reputation consequences and increased caution.'
#     - Mother Jia dies (-944); shortly after, daughter Xia dies young (-942), deepening
#       household grief and Ren’s anxious irritability.
#     - Later assault incident (age 52–54) during grazing/seedling conflict; reinforces
#       local image of Ren as capable of sudden violence despite generally smooth demeanor.
#     phase: Midlife
#   - age_range: 56-69
#     key_events:
#     - Transitions headship gradually to eldest son Hao; formation of three-generation
#       stem household with Hao’s wife and children under one roof.
#     - 'Sister Li dies (-949) and younger son Jun later dies (-912): Ren experiences
#       repeated family thinning and becomes more controlling about property and ritual
#       obligations.'

#       Relationship is steady and cooperative on the surface (shared labor, childrearing),
#       but strained by Ren’s self-serving streak and periodic temper; Wei is the quiet

#     name: Mo
#     narrative_role: Firstborn sister remembered mostly through the mother’s brief

#   - birth_year: -992
#     death_age: 43
#     death_year: -949
#     name: Li
#     narrative_role: Older sister who survives into Ren’s adulthood; marries out to
#       a nearby hamlet but stays in contact. She acts as a practical mediator between

#     death_age: 69
#     death_year: -920
#     name: Ren

#       are threatened.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: -987
#     death_age: 26
#     death_year: -961
#     name: Shun
#     narrative_role: Younger brother who grows into an energetic helper and occasional
#       rival for resources; his early adult death removes a key laborer and changes
#       Ren’s obligations toward parents and later toward nieces/nephews (if any through
#       Li).
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Short-term gains and a reputation for being 'smooth' but not fully
#       trusted; contributes to escalations that end in the homicide settlement.
#     scene: Ren quietly shifts a boundary marker and later argues the new line as if
#       it were old; in exchanges he under-measures grain and uses charm to deflect
#       suspicion.
#     timing: Adolescence through midlife (ages 14-45), culminating in boundary disputes
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (very low)
#   - consequence: Builds social cover and access to elders’ mediation; helps his household
#       survive reputational damage after violence.
#     scene: At communal sacrifices and work-parties he speaks softly, mediates minor
#       quarrels, and offers small gifts/food, appearing cooperative even with people
#       he privately resents.
#     timing: All phases, especially young adulthood (ages 18-35)
#     trait: Agreeableness (high)
#   - consequence: Household stability and sufficient surplus to raise four children;
#       strengthens his claim to be a 'proper' farmer even when morally suspect.
#     scene: 'Keeps regular work routines: early rising, careful seed storage, methodical
#       repairs to tools and pens; pushes family to meet corvée obligations on time.'
#     timing: Young adulthood through old age (ages 18-69)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (high)
#   - consequence: Heightened conflict and risk-taking in confrontations; contributes
#       to the intensity of the homicide and later assault.
#     scene: During drought years and after theft, Ren becomes vigilant, sleeps poorly,
#       and interprets neighbors’ actions as threats; this feeds quick escalation in
#       disputes.
#     timing: Later childhood during drought (ages 10-15) and midlife (ages 33-55)
#     trait: Neuroticism (moderately high)
#   - consequence: Limits overt status-seeking; makes his self-serving actions less
#       visible, but also reduces broad community support when disputes turn serious.
#     scene: He avoids being the loud center of gatherings, preferring small conversations
#       and watching others; he chooses influence through private deals rather than
#       public leadership.
#     timing: Adolescence and adulthood (ages 12-60)
#     trait: Extraversion (somewhat low)
#   - consequence: More prone to misunderstandings and clumsy escalation; depends on
#       wife/elders for planning and formal dealings.
#     scene: He struggles with complex counting/allocations and relies on rules-of-thumb;
#       in negotiations he leans on emotion, social pressure, and confident assertion
#       rather than detailed argument.
#     timing: Young adulthood through midlife (ages 18-50)
#     trait: Intelligence (low)
#   - consequence: Improves marriage prospects and social leverage; can mask low honesty-humility
#       by making others initially inclined to trust him.
#     scene: As a young man he is noticed at work-parties and rituals; older villagers
#       comment on his appearance, which helps him gain goodwill and sometimes leniency
#       even when suspected of sharp dealing.
#     timing: Young adulthood (ages 16-30) with lingering effects later
#     trait: Physical attractiveness (very high)
# number_of_children: '4'
# number_of_siblings: '3'
# occupation: Dry-field grain farmer (millet/other grains) with household gardening
#   and small livestock
# religion: Household ancestor offerings (food/drink, simple shrine/altar) + seasonal
#   agricultural rites; occasional participation in village sacrifices
# sibling_ages_at_death:

# - 43
# - 26
# sibling_sexes:
# - F
# - F
# - M
# structured_incidents:
# - event: After harvest, some of his stored millet (and a small piglet) was stolen
#     from a lightly secured shed near his courtyard; he suspected a neighboring household’s
#     teenage sons but recovered little beyond a few scattered grain sacks after local
#     elders intervened.
#   reasoning: Smallholders commonly faced petty theft (grain, tools, livestock) and
#     occasional fraud/cheating in exchanges, and he lived long enough to accumulate
#     repeated exposure.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 33–34 (late autumn into early winter)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: During a boundary dispute over a strip of dry-field land, a fight escalated
#     and he struck another man with a heavy farm tool (a wooden club/hoe handle); the
#     man later died from the head injury, and the matter was settled through local
#     elite mediation with compensation to the victim’s kin.
#   reasoning: Homicide outside warfare was relatively uncommon for settled farmers;
#     even where interpersonal violence was endemic, most episodes did not end in death,
#     and reaching old age in a stable community suggests he avoided the most extreme
#     outcomes.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 41–42 (spring field-preparation season)
#   type: homicide
# - event: In a later quarrel over grazing and damaged seedlings, he and a neighboring
#     farmer exchanged blows; he knocked the man down and injured his shoulder/arm,
#     leaving him unable to work properly for weeks but not killing him.
#   reasoning: The most typical form of perpetrator violence for a rural adult male
#     is a serious fight/assault (land/irrigation disputes, drunken quarrels, kin conflicts,
#     disciplining dependents); his low honesty-humility raises conflict/exploitation
#     risk despite high agreeableness.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 52–54 (early summer)
#   type: physical_assault_perp

Ren was born in a farming settlement on the low ground and gentle rises of what is now southern Shandong. Nearby walled centers held aristocratic houses that collected grain and labor from the villages. His family lived between worlds: they spoke a Sinitic tongue for dealings with overseers and ritual days, and another local speech at home with older neighbors whose customs did not always match those of the Zhou courts. In their courtyard they kept a simple ancestor place—an upright board and a small table—where his mother set bowls of millet gruel and a cup of fermented drink for the dead at the turning of seasons.

He entered the household as the third child. The first, a girl named Mo, died before Ren had words. His mother, Jia, told the story once a year when she set a bit of steamed grain beside Mo’s marker, and then she stopped speaking about it. Ren’s older surviving sister Li was close in age. She carried him on her hip when their mother had to spin hemp or walk to the fields. His younger brother Shun came two years after Ren, loud and quick, and their father Bo treated him with extra patience because he was the second son to live past infancy.

Bo farmed dry fields. The family planted millet and other grains in the rainfed plots and kept a small garden by the house. Pigs mattered. A pig could be traded in a crisis, slaughtered for a feast, or given as part of a settlement. Ren learned early that the pens needed attention every day. He was short for a man and light in build, but he moved steadily and did not waste motion. By seven he was scaring birds away from fresh-sown furrows with a clapper and a sling.

When Ren was five, a wet season ruined part of the village’s low fields. The floodwater did not roar like a mountain river; it sat and spread, soaking seed and turning paths to mud. The stores smelled sour by midwinter. Bo carried a basket of grain to a household with better ground and returned with a smaller basket and a promise to repay at harvest. Jia stretched the meals. She boiled millet longer and added chopped greens from the ditch edges.

The drought years began while Ren was still small enough to sleep curled at his mother’s side. The rain came late and then not at all. The men argued about whether to hold seed back or sow everything and hope. Ren watched Bo pour grain into a jar and press the lid down, then lay a stone on it so no child could pry it open. In those years Ren learned the rules of obligation. When the estate runner, Su, came with a tally stick and men behind him, Bo went out with a bowed head and a tight jaw. The family owed days of labor and a portion of grain. Bo paid first and complained later, in their own speech, where outsiders would not understand.

Ren did not talk much in groups. At work-parties he listened, smiling at the right moments, handing a water gourd without being asked. People warmed to him. His face helped; even as a youth, older women spoke openly about it, and men teased him for it. He kept his eyes lowered and let them talk. He also learned to take what he could. When grain was measured into baskets, his hands lingered and he nudged the heap so the basket looked full. When his father asked how many bundles were bound, he gave a number that kept himself out of extra work.

At nineteen, Bo arranged his marriage to a young woman named Wei from a nearby settlement. She brought hemp cloth, a few pots, and the knowledge of her own family’s fields and ways. The marriage bound the households. Wei moved into Ren’s courtyard, and from then on Jia’s offerings included a bowl set for Wei’s ancestors as well as their own.

Children came quickly. Lan was born when Ren was twenty-one, Hao two years after that, then Xia, then Jun. Ren liked the quiet hour before dawn when the air was cool and the pigs were still. He sat on the low threshold, chewing roasted millet cakes left from the night before, listening for the first stir in the pens. He enjoyed fermented grain drink in the evenings, not enough to fall down, enough to loosen his tongue. He laughed easily when someone else made a joke, and he remembered small slights for a long time.

Shun died at twenty-six, after a short illness that left him thin and hoarse. The loss mattered in the fields. Ren took on more of the heavy work and drove himself hard through harvest, keeping his household’s obligations met. Wei carried water and weeded longer in the sun. Jia began to lean on a staff. Bo’s hair went fully gray.

Bo died when Ren was thirty-three. The rites lasted days. Ren helped wash the body, bound the jaw, and placed Bo on a mat. He and Wei offered cooked millet, sliced pork, and a cup of drink at the ancestor place. After burial, Ren spoke for the household in dealings with Su and the elders. He grew careful about how he stored grain and who moved through his yard.

That autumn, after threshing, someone broke into the shed where Ren kept sacks of millet and a penned piglet. In the morning the latch hung loose and the ground was scuffed with many feet. Some sacks had been dragged away. The piglet was gone. Ren walked the village lanes, looking at fences, listening to the dogs. He accused no one openly at first. He visited Elder Gui with a gift of grain and spoke softly, naming the boys he suspected—teen sons from a neighboring household. The elders called the families together. A few scattered sacks were recovered from a ditch edge. Most of it stayed lost. Ren repaired his shed with heavier beams and set thorn branches along the back wall.

His sister Li married out to a hamlet close enough that a strong walker could reach it by midday. She visited with dried fish or a bundle of hemp. She and Wei spoke easily together. Li also spoke plainly to Ren when he crossed lines. After the theft, she told him that a man who makes enemies finds trouble. Ren nodded and did what he planned anyway.

Li died when Ren was forty. She had been ill through the winter and did not recover. The loss cut away a bridge between Ren's household and the wider network of hamlets she had married into.

By forty-two, Ren had a strip of land whose boundary ran along a low ridge. The markers were stones and old stumps, remembered by people as much as seen. In spring, during field preparation, a dispute flared with another farmer over that strip. Words turned into shoving. Ren grabbed a heavy hoe handle and struck. The blow landed on the man's head. The man staggered away and died later that day. Ren did not flee. Elder Gui and Agent Su managed the settlement. Ren brought grain and a pig to the victim's kin. The terms were spoken in front of witnesses, with offerings made to quiet the anger of the dead man and to keep the village from splitting into fighting sides. Ren returned to his fields with a narrower margin of surplus and a tighter hold on his temper, at least in public.

Jia died when Ren was forty-five. Wei kept the ancestor place clean and added new markers. Ren increased the offerings for a season: more meat, a better cup, extra gruel. That same year his daughter Xia died at twenty-one. She had been old enough to work hard and young enough that her loss cut directly into the household’s future. Wei’s face stayed tight for weeks. Ren grew more watchful and more quick to interpret any neighbor’s move as a challenge.

In early summer when Ren was fifty-three, grazing became the trigger. Someone’s animals broke into seedlings near the edge of the fields. Accusations moved fast. Ren and a neighboring farmer exchanged blows in the open. Ren knocked the man down and twisted his arm until it injured at the shoulder. The man could not work properly for weeks. This time Elder Gui forced a smaller settlement: grain for the injured man’s household and a public acknowledgement of fault so the feud would not continue.

Ren’s eldest son Hao married and stayed in the courtyard, bringing a wife named Yin. Ren liked having a strong adult man under his roof, even as it made him irritable to share authority. Jun pushed back more than Hao did. He argued about how much grain should be kept versus traded, and he disliked Ren’s habit of pressing others while presenting himself as reasonable. Jun’s household did not settle into a joint arrangement for long. His own path kept him partly apart until his death at forty-eight.

As Ren aged, he handed more of the heavy work to Hao but kept control of key decisions: where to plant, which pig to sell, how much to offer at rites. He walked the boundaries himself, sometimes alone, counting paces, checking stones, putting his foot down on weeds that grew too high. He avoided noisy gatherings. He preferred a few men he trusted. One was an older farmer who shared fermented drink with him after work and played at small wagers with knucklebones. Ren cheated when he could and laughed when caught, then paid up quickly so the game would continue.

Winter illnesses came more often. In his sixty-ninth year the cold months set in hard. Ren began coughing before the new moon. The sound filled the sleeping room at night. Yin heated water and made thick millet porridge. Wei kept the hearth going and placed extra food at the ancestor place, asking Bo and Jia to steady the house. Ren died before the end of winter, still in Hao’s stem household.

They prepared his body and carried him to burial ground near his father. At the grave they left a bowl of millet and a cup of drink, then covered him and stamped the earth flat.
