# Debug information (not displayed on page):
# Age at death: 58
# Agreeableness (% rank): 83
# Birth date: November 12, 26360 BC
# Birth year: 26360 BC
# Climate now: Today the Egypt–Sudan Nile corridor is hot and extremely arid outside
#   the river, with true desert conditions dominating the surrounding landscape. Habitable,
#   productive land is concentrated almost entirely along the irrigated floodplain and
#   river margins.
# Climate then: Around 26360 BC (late Pleistocene), the Nile Valley sat near the transition
#   into the African Humid Period, so conditions were generally cooler than today and
#   often somewhat wetter or more seasonally variable, with stronger river flow than
#   in extreme arid phases. Vegetation beyond the floodplain was still limited, but
#   there were more frequent opportunities for grass/shrub cover and usable water sources
#   in nearby depressions and wadis than in the hyperarid modern desert.
# Conscientiousness (% rank): 16
# Cultural tradition: undifferentiated
# Death date: August 7, 26301 BC
# Environment: A narrow ribbon of riverine habitat (channels, floodplain, and levees)
#   bordered closely by desert, with patches of reeds and riverbank woodland and nearby
#   wadis/oases used seasonally for hunting and gathering. People would have relied
#   heavily on the Nile’s water, fish, waterfowl, and small game, with movement between
#   river margins and adjacent desert-steppe zones as conditions allowed.

The Nile Valley was narrow. Beyond the river the ground went hard and dry, and most living things kept close to the water. In 26,360 BC the air was cooler than it is now, and the river did not behave the same way every year. Some years it spread wide and cut new channels. A campsite that had been safe could be taken by water.

Tima was born on a raised bank above a bend where reeds grew thick. When the water dropped, fish stayed in shallow pockets and could be taken by hand or trapped in narrow gaps between reeds. She was the fifth of six children. Two sisters died as infants. A brother died at six. The oldest brother lived long enough to go gray and move stiffly from an old injury.

Both of her parents died while she was still small. After that she slept where there was space—near an aunt one season, near an uncle the next, sometimes beside an older sister-in-law who did not pretend she wanted an extra child pressed against her at night. No one explained much. People fed her, corrected her, and expected her to keep up.

One year the river rose fast. The backwater beside camp turned into moving water overnight. Adults grabbed bundles and carried the smallest children. Tima could walk but not well in the dark on soft ground. An older woman took her wrist and pulled her up onto higher ground where the sand held.

They stayed there for weeks. Mosquitoes collected at dusk and dawn. Smoke drove them off for a while, then the insects returned. Tima scratched until her arms broke open. The same woman who had pulled her to safety slapped her hand once when she saw blood under Tima’s nails, then smeared fat over the raw spots and tied a strip of hide around one forearm to keep her from tearing it again.

Tima grew into someone who could do most things passably and could not keep track of small, necessary routines. She misplaced stone tools and wasted time searching. She set down a scraper and forgot where she had left it. Once she left a skin container open and watched water sink into sand. When people shouted, she did not argue. She took the blame, then carried extra loads the next day without being asked.

She talked easily when someone sat near her. She laughed at small jokes. But she didn’t take the center of a group or push herself into decisions. When other people argued, she listened hard, watching who stayed quiet and who spoke too much. She was quick to give up her place on a mat, quick to pass a piece of roasted bird to someone who hadn’t gotten enough, and quick to stop when someone told her to.

In her late teens she formed a long partnership with a man from a nearby camp cluster along the same stretch of river. He was steady and preferred things done the same way each day. He could strike stone cleanly and not waste flakes. He wanted tools set in one place. Tima agreed and failed. He got angry, then resigned. After that he reminded her without expecting it to change her. She accepted the reminders without pretending she didn’t need them.

They lived from the river and the strip of growth beside it: fish, waterfowl, small animals caught close to cover, and seeds gathered where floodwater had left damp ground. When rare rains came out in the desert, the group made short trips to a wadi where grass rose quickly and small pools collected. Everyone moved fast on those trips. The green did not last.

Tima went with the women and older children. She dug for roots in wet pockets and stripped seed heads into a skin bag. She forgot things there too. More than once she walked back without a digging stick and had to turn around. People swore at her and kept moving. The work suited her because it did not depend on careful storage. You took what you could carry and returned to the river.

Sickness came in patterns tied to water. In some seasons many people were tired at once. Bellies swelled. Children stayed thin even when they ate. Some had blood in their stool. People stopped wading in certain quiet inlets. They drew water from faster runs even when it meant longer walks and more arguing over turns.

Tima was useful in those seasons because she did not make speeches. She grabbed a child by the shoulder and moved them away from the slow pools. She picked up containers left too near muddy edges and set them on higher ground. She was gentle when she remembered to be and rough when she was distracted. If someone protested, she stopped. If no one did, she kept going.

During a short cold, dry spell in her adult years, the bank plants thinned and small game scattered. The group leaned harder on fish. They set simple traps in gaps between reeds and built low brush barriers to guide fish into shallow pockets. Repairs mattered then.

Tima was bad at repairs. She would start binding fiber, then stand up to help with something else and forget what she’d left behind. Once she returned to find a dog chewing a length of cord she had been working on. She hit the dog with a stick and then had to be pulled back when it yelped and snapped. The next day she tried again and lost another piece. After that she began sitting close to another person when she worked. Not for company. So someone would tell her to stop getting up.

In middle adulthood, in another high-water year, she nearly drowned. She went to check traps along a flooded edge where reeds hid a sudden drop. Her foot slid off a submerged root. She went under and swallowed water. She came up coughing and clawed at reeds that bent away. A hand locked around her upper arm and hauled her onto the bank.

She lay on her side, shaking and spitting river water and mud. Her partner crouched over her. She waved him back and asked if the trap line had torn loose. It was not bravery. It was how she kept herself from panicking—by fixing her attention on the one thing that could still be checked.

She had four children. One died in the first year. Three sons lived past infancy and then died young—one at twenty-three, two before they reached their teens. She did not make a show of grief. She got quieter. She stopped complaining about aches and hunger. She watched other people’s children more closely, especially the ones who fought quickly or cried easily.

She didn’t comfort them with words. She assigned them work. Carry reeds. Hold this end. Bring the water from there, not here. When they did it, she nodded once or said “good” in a flat voice that made them straighten up.

By her fifties she was treated as an elder because people were used to her presence in decisions. When two households argued over a stretch of bank for setting traps, she sat between them, knees drawn up, listening until they repeated themselves and ran out of heat. Then she named a split—this bend for one, that for the other, alternating days at the better landing. Both sides disliked it. Both accepted it.

In the summer of her fifty-eighth year, a back channel near camp turned still. From a distance it looked easy: close, shaded, quiet. People filled containers there.

Within days, cramps spread through the band. Then diarrhea. Adults tried to keep working through it. Children cried with thirst and were told to sip and wait. Tima tried to do what she had done in earlier bouts—push everyone toward cleaner water, keep children from wading, keep the sleeping area from turning into filth.

She failed at the last part because she was sick too. She stood, swayed, and sat down again. Her mouth dried and stayed dry. When she tried to drink, it ran through her.

On August 7, 26,301 BC, she lay on a mat in the shade of a riverbank tree. The river was close enough to hear. People moved around her, stepping carefully. Her breathing slowed. The cramps stopped, not because she was better, but because she no longer had the strength for them.
