# Debug information (not displayed on page):
# Age at death: 58
# Agreeableness (% rank): 83
# Birth date: November 12, 26360 BC
# Birth year: 26360 BC
# Climate now: Today the Egypt–Sudan Nile corridor is hot and extremely arid outside
#   the river, with true desert conditions dominating the surrounding landscape. Habitable,
#   productive land is concentrated almost entirely along the irrigated floodplain and
#   river margins.
# Climate then: Around 26360 BC (late Pleistocene), the Nile Valley sat near the transition
#   into the African Humid Period, so conditions were generally cooler than today and
#   often somewhat wetter or more seasonally variable, with stronger river flow than
#   in extreme arid phases. Vegetation beyond the floodplain was still limited, but
#   there were more frequent opportunities for grass/shrub cover and usable water sources
#   in nearby depressions and wadis than in the hyperarid modern desert.
# Conscientiousness (% rank): 16
# Cultural tradition: undifferentiated
# Death date: August 7, 26301 BC
# Environment: A narrow ribbon of riverine habitat (channels, floodplain, and levees)
#   bordered closely by desert, with patches of reeds and riverbank woodland and nearby
#   wadis/oases used seasonally for hunting and gathering. People would have relied
#   heavily on the Nile’s water, fish, waterfowl, and small game, with movement between
#   river margins and adjacent desert-steppe zones as conditions allowed.

# events:

#   timing: childhood to adulthood (at least once)
# - event: Seasonal exploitation of a nearby wadi/oasis that became productive after

#     drying
#   timing: repeated episodes, most likely ages 15–45
# - event: Localized outbreak of water-associated gastrointestinal illness in the band
#     linked to stagnant backwaters or contaminated drinking points (non-lethal for
#     most, disruptive for weeks)
#   timing: multiple times across life; especially adulthood
# - event: High parasite burden period (e.g., schistosome-like exposure, intestinal
#     worms) leading to community-level fatigue/anemia and changes in water-contact
#     practices (favoring certain landing spots or boiling/settling water when feasible)
#   timing: adulthood, recurring seasonally
# - event: A short cold/dry spell (weeks to a season) reducing riverbank vegetation
#     and small game near camp, increasing travel costs and reliance on fishing/weirs/traps
#   timing: anytime; plausibly in her 20s–40s

The Nile Valley she was born into was a thin strip of water and green. Step a short distance away and the ground turned hard and bare. The river did not hold still. One year it ran in a single strong course; another year it split into side channels and quiet pockets, then closed them again with silt.

We’ll call her Tima. She was born on firm ground above the floodplain where a camp could stay dry when the water spread. She was the fifth of six children. Before she could remember much, both her parents were gone. After that, she belonged to the attention of aunts, older cousins, and whoever had hands free. She learned the rules the way she learned everything else: by being pulled back from the edge, by being cut off from food, by watching who was allowed to speak and who swallowed words.

When the river climbed higher than the adults expected, it came into the sleeping places at night. In the morning the hearth ash had turned to sludge. People moved fast. They carried mats, flint, infants, and water skins up onto a higher bank and slept there while insects rose out of the wet ground. Tima was given a smoking bundle to tend so the bugs stayed off the children. She kept letting it go out, then flaring it too hot. An older woman took it from her without scolding and showed her with her hands: pinch the damp reeds, feed them slow, keep the smoke steady. Tima watched and copied.

She grew into someone people could work beside without bracing for trouble. When food was being divided, she did not reach in early. When children grabbed at the same piece, she didn’t shout at them. She put her hand down between them and pulled it apart. If the split came uneven, she took what was left over and moved on.

Most days were river work. When the water fell and the mudflats opened, she went out with others to take fish from shallow pools and narrow channels. They used baskets and simple barriers set where the current pinched. Sometimes she stood for hours with water at her calves, feeling with her feet for a fish pressed into grass. Sometimes she waited in reeds for a bird to lift, then threw a stone low and fast. She cleaned what she brought back and didn’t waste what could be eaten.

After rare desert rains, the band left the main river for short stretches. They walked into the wadis with skins of water and came back before the pools shrank to mud. Out there Tima gathered what she could carry: seeds shaken into a bag, small fruits, roots pried up where the soil still held damp. The days were tight and quick. The return to the river always came before anyone wanted it.

In her late teens she took up with a man from a nearby camp and stayed with him. He worked without showing off. He chipped new points and fixed broken hafts while others talked. They argued like anyone. Once he left a sharp flake where a child could step on it, and she snapped at him in front of the others. Another time she set down a water skin and forgot it, and he walked back for it, silent and angry. Their fights ended because she stopped once the point was made. She didn’t circle back for a second round.

She bore four children over the years. One died before it could speak. The three boys who lived made it to the age when they wanted to test every limit. She corrected them with her hands more than her voice. If a boy lunged at his brother, she caught his wrist and held him until his strength ran out. If he tried to keep the best bit for himself, she took it from his fist and put it back into the shared pile. She didn’t put on a performance of it. She did it and went on with the work.

There were seasons when the wind stayed cold and the riverbank plants thinned. Fishing carried more of the weight then. People checked their baskets more often and shifted their simple barriers to places where the water ran. Tima’s heels split from standing in wet and grit. She rubbed fat into the cracks at night and walked the next morning.

Sickness was part of camp life. After weeks of wading and washing near slow backwaters, stomachs turned. People weakened and snapped at each other. Children cried from thirst and were afraid to drink. The band changed its habits the way it changed anything: by copying what kept someone upright. They drew water from faster current when they could. They kept it in skins long enough for grit to settle, then poured it off. When fuel was on hand, they heated water and broth for the sick.

Tima enforced the small rules that made the difference. She didn’t announce them. She just moved people. When a younger woman squatted at a warm, still inlet because it was close, Tima touched her elbow and steered her to the main flow. When a boy dipped his hands where others had relieved themselves, she slapped his wrist and made him rinse downstream.

As she aged, people started bringing their disputes to her before they spread. A man accused a cousin of taking the best share from a catch. A trap line had been set too close to another camp’s spot. Tima listened while they talked over each other, then asked them to show her the fish, the cut marks, the place in the reeds. She told one person to give back a portion, told another to move the traps, and made them do it in daylight where everyone could see the correction and let it end there.

In the summer of her fifty-eighth year, the camp began drawing water from a back channel because it was near and easy. The water there ran warm and slow. Tima had warned against it before, but the heat made people careless. When her stomach loosened, she drank to replace what she lost and it ran through her. By the second day she couldn’t hold down broth. Her mouth dried and her hands shook when she tried to tie off a skin.

She tried to stand and walk to the cleaner current. Halfway up, she had to kneel. Someone brought her back under shade and laid her on a mat. She kept her eyes open and followed the sounds of the camp as if listening could still keep things in order: a child whining, someone splitting reeds, a man calling from the waterline.

On August 7, 26,301 BC, she stopped getting up. Her breathing slowed until it ended. The river went on past the camp, thick with silt, carrying torn reeds along the edge where the current turned.
