# Debug information (not displayed on page):
# Age at death: 58
# Agreeableness (% rank): 83
# Birth date: November 12, 26360 BC
# Birth year: 26360 BC
# Climate now: Today the Egypt–Sudan Nile corridor is hot and extremely arid outside
#   the river, with true desert conditions dominating the surrounding landscape. Habitable,
#   productive land is concentrated almost entirely along the irrigated floodplain and
#   river margins.
# Climate then: Around 26360 BC (late Pleistocene), the Nile Valley sat near the transition
#   into the African Humid Period, so conditions were generally cooler than today and
#   often somewhat wetter or more seasonally variable, with stronger river flow than
#   in extreme arid phases. Vegetation beyond the floodplain was still limited, but
#   there were more frequent opportunities for grass/shrub cover and usable water sources
#   in nearby depressions and wadis than in the hyperarid modern desert.
# Conscientiousness (% rank): 16
# Cultural tradition: undifferentiated
# Death date: August 7, 26301 BC
# Environment: A narrow ribbon of riverine habitat (channels, floodplain, and levees)
#   bordered closely by desert, with patches of reeds and riverbank woodland and nearby
#   wadis/oases used seasonally for hunting and gathering. People would have relied
#   heavily on the Nile’s water, fish, waterfowl, and small game, with movement between
#   river margins and adjacent desert-steppe zones as conditions allowed.

Today the Nile is a thin green line: irrigated ground and buildings pressed against desert. In 26,360 BC it was still a narrow ribbon of life bordered by dry land, but the river was less fixed. Some years it climbed into camps that had sat above the water for a long time. It cut side channels, left backwaters, and laid down fresh silt and sandbars. Away from the floodplain there were seasons when wadis held water and grass for a short run of weeks, then went back to stone.

We’ll call her Kalu. The name is only a handle for a person whose real name is gone.

She was born near a bend where the current slowed, reeds grew tall, and fish held in quiet water. She was the fifth of six children. Food and attention arrived in quick motions: a hand pushing her back from the edge, a scrap pressed into her palm, a brief touch at her shoulder to steer her out of someone’s way. Two sisters died before they could walk. A brother died at six. After that, the adults did not stop work. They spoke low for a while, then divided what needed dividing and went back to the river.

Both of Kalu’s parents died while she was still small. No one explained it to her. An aunt took her sleeping place without discussion and began telling her where to sit, when to fetch water, which child to watch. Kalu learned by watching faces and hands. She learned who shared without keeping count and who made you pay back every favor. She learned to step in early—holding a baby, carrying a bundle, scraping ash from a hearth—because the child who made herself useful stayed closer to warmth when the night wind came off the water.

A high flood remade the place she thought of as home. The river rose and kept rising, swallowing the low paths and turning familiar ground into water. People woke to the sound of current pushing through reeds near the sleeping mats. Adults moved fast and spoke in short commands. They rolled mats, grabbed babies, lifted stones from hearths so they could be used again, and carried bundles up to a higher strip of bank.

Kalu slipped in the rush and went down hard. A cousin hauled her up by the upper arm and shoved her forward. The bruise stayed for days. Nobody apologized. The point was not comfort. The point was getting bodies out of the water.

On the higher ground the insects came thick. Smoke drove them back but stung eyes and throat. Kalu was told to keep damp reeds on the fire so it smoked without flaring. She did it badly at first. She smothered the coals, then panicked and fed in too much dry fuel, throwing sparks. An older woman stepped in and did it right without a word, moving Kalu’s hands aside as if she were clearing a tool off a work surface. Kalu sat close and copied the rhythm until she could hold the smoke steady.

That was how she learned most things. She showed up. She tried. She forgot what she had just done and left a mess for someone else. A stone blade went missing because she set it down in grass and walked away. A hide container leaked because she did not knot it tight. When people found the mistake, she didn’t argue. She took the sharp words and the looks. Then she tried to pay it back with effort—extra trips for wood, longer hours cleaning fish, carrying heavier bundles on the walk.

In her late teens she took a long-term partner from a nearby cluster of camps. He was steady, quiet, and particular about tools. He put things back where they belonged and expected the same. Kalu borrowed his scraper, used it by the river, and left it on the bank. Later she swore it wouldn’t happen again. It happened again. He stopped handing her certain pieces of stone and bone. He did it without drama. Kalu accepted it. She did not demand to be treated as careful when she wasn’t.

Her days were built from repeated work. At dawn she went with other women to check fish traps: woven baskets and brush set where fish pushed along the edge of current. They waded knee-deep, feeling with their feet for the firm bottom and the snag of a stake. They carried fish back in slings and bundles, cleaned them with stone edges, and laid strips out near the smoke so they would last. She gathered small fruits and seeds along the floodplain when the water withdrew and left damp ground. She cut reeds for mats and shelter walls, tied bundles, and hauled them back with a strap across her forehead.

When hunters brought in small game, she helped break it down and divide it. She did not reach for the best parts. People noticed that. It made them less guarded around her, even when she was clumsy with other things.

After rare rains, a nearby wadi turned green and drew animals in tight. The group moved away from the river for a short season. The first day out was hard: long stretches with dry mouths and the sun on their backs. Then the land dipped and there was grass, shallow pools, and tracks cut into damp ground. Everyone worked faster. Kalu went with women and adolescents. They dug for roots in soft places, knocked seeds into skin bags, and lifted stones to grab small creatures hiding in the wet shade. The wadi suited her. It demanded attention to what was in front of her, not a long chain of plans.

A cold, dry spell tightened the valley. Riverbank plants thinned and the easy small game near camp became scarce. The group leaned hard on fish. They set more barriers of brush and stakes in narrow runs and checked them more often. A broken section meant a wasted day.

This was when Kalu’s scattered attention caused real trouble. She started mending a panel, set it down to carry a bundle, and came back to find a dog chewing the fibers. Another time she left a strip of netting within reach of a toddler, who pulled it apart while adults argued over where to place the next stake. The snapping came quick. Kalu didn’t soften it with jokes or excuses. She changed how she worked. When delicate work needed doing, she sat beside an older woman and stayed there until the piece was finished. To other eyes it looked like simple company. For Kalu it was a way to stop herself from drifting.

Sickness moved through the camp in patterns tied to water. In some seasons people who spent long hours wading and washing grew worn out in a way that sleep didn’t fix. Children’s bellies swelled. Adults took longer to stand after squatting. The camp adjusted without speeches. They stopped letting children splash in still backwaters. They drew drinking water from moving current. They kept certain landing spots and avoided others.

Then there were the waves of gut sickness. A back channel would turn warm and slow, and after that people started folding over with cramps and running for the brush. Weakness spread through the camp like bad weather. Kalu treated it as urgent work, not a story. She helped move the water-drawing to a cleaner spot. She kept fuel close and heated water when the fire was already going. When someone was too weak to walk to the place downwind where people went, she cleaned them and kept them covered against the night chill. She did it without cooing or ceremony. She did it because leaving someone filthy and exposed brought more trouble.

During another high-water season in her middle years, she nearly died. She went out early to check traps where the river had crept into the reedbed. The edge looked solid. It wasn’t. Her foot slid off into deeper water and the cold shock locked her chest. She surfaced once, clawed at reeds, missed, and went under again.

A younger man ran in and caught the strap of her carrying sling, dragging her toward the bank. Kalu lay on her side coughing up river water and mud. Her partner knelt beside her. She waved him off and asked if the traps had torn free. It wasn’t bravery. It was how she forced her mind into a single line when everything in her body was shaking.

She had four children. One died as an infant. Three sons lived long enough to carry loads and set traps, then died before they reached old age. After that she had less patience for small irritations and less interest in talk that went nowhere. She watched other people’s children more closely, especially the ones who shoved and took. When they crossed a line, she corrected them fast and handed them work right after, so they could step back into the group without a long standoff.

By her fifties she was an elder in the plain sense: someone people went to when arguments threatened to split a camp. When two households fought over a good stretch of bank for traps, they brought it to her because she didn’t pour heat on it. She listened until she had the few facts that mattered—who set what, when, and where the stakes had been—and then told them how it would be divided. Her choices left both sides a little unhappy, which made it easier for both to accept.

In the summer of her fifty-eighth year, a convenient backwater near camp turned foul. People kept using it because it was close and because hauling water from the main current took time. Kalu fell sick hard. The diarrhea emptied her until she could not stand without shaking. She tried to drink. It ran through her. Her mouth stayed dry. She lay on a mat in the shade while the camp moved around her, the river noise close enough to hear between voices.

On August 7, 26,301 BC, her breathing slowed and stopped. The Nile kept sliding past the reedbeds, heavy with silt. The backwater stayed still.
