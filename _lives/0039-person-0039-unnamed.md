The child had no settled name. He was born on 29 October 1184 in a village near the forest-edge fields of north Bihar, in the Mithila country, where local headmen and tax collectors answered to bigger rulers to the west and north. His people spoke an eastern Indo-Aryan village tongue and kept a household shrine with routine offerings. The family lived in a joint household under the authority of the father’s elders, with several married brothers sharing a courtyard and grain store.

His father, Devaram, worked other men’s land. He owed labor to a patron who held the better plots and the oxen. Devaram left before sunrise when there was transplanting or harvest work and came home with mud on his calves and a small share of rice. His wife, Sita, worked in the same fields when the patron’s overseer called for women. She carried bundles of seedlings, bent over rows, and took grain wages when the work was done. At home she husked rice, fetched water, and fed the children.

This was her fourth birth. Three older children already filled the sleeping space: Govinda, a boy; Padma, a girl; and Harsha, a boy. More children came after them, until eleven had been born into the household.

Sita went into labor in the family room off the courtyard. Women from the household steadied her and wiped the child clean when he came. The birth dragged. When he emerged, his body did not take breath. They rubbed his back, cleared his mouth, and pressed warm cloth to his chest. He never cried. He was dead before the naming rites began.
