#     name: Elcha
#     narrative_role: Early stabilizing caretaker and storyteller/ritual keeper. Nora
#       listens for practical plant knowledge but rejects moral lessons; grandmother’s

#     name: Sola
#     narrative_role: Youngest surviving child; more affectionate than her sisters.
#       Nora is protective in a possessive way; Sola’s death as a teen is one of the
#       few events that cracks Nora’s emotional armor.
#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 25
#     connection: Occurs during the relocation period, when Nora is still proving herself
#       in the destination band; the fight over fruit trees and a cached stone tool
#       triggers later social sanctions and shapes her reputation as dangerous but capable.
#     incident: physical_assault_perp
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-7
#     key_events:
#     - Raised in an extended-family camp in the dry-forest highlands; learns plant
#       foods and fire/processing tasks from mother and grandmother while watching repeated
#       infant deaths in the family.
#     - Frequent clashes with older sister Sama over rules and chores; Nora is physically
#       big for her age and uses force to get her way.
#     - 'First remembered band ritual: small offerings and spoken requests at a water
#       source; Nora imitates the words but treats it as practical ''insurance.'''
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 8-17
#     key_events:
#     - At ~15 (year -9437) grandmother Elcha dies; Nora’s conflicts with her mother
#       intensify without a mediator.
#     - At ~16 (year -9436) younger brother Nima dies (illness or accident); adults
#       argue about negligence and taboo-breaking, and Nora is blamed in part for not
#       watching him carefully.
#     - Nora becomes a strong gatherer and processor; she prefers solitary foraging
#       routes and avoids camp socializing.
#     phase: Later childhood / adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-35
#     key_events:
#     - Forms first pair-bond with Anch (~age 20, year -9432); first child Och is born
#       soon after.
#     - 'Begins long-distance relocation process (~age 23-26, years -9429 to -9426):
#       leaves the birth territory and joins a different band/ecozone through partner
#       ties and conflict fallout.'
#     - Father Chol dies when Nora is ~27 (year -9425), reducing her leverage and support;
#       soon after, two infant sons (Ola and Pel) die (years -9424 and -9422).
#     phase: Young adult
#   - age_range: 36-55
#     key_events:
#     - Mother Tali dies when Nora is ~42 (year -9410); Nora returns briefly or sends
#       goods/messages, but reconciliation is incomplete.
#     - Oldest sister Sama’s death (year -9422) is processed late due to distance; Nora’s
#       kin ties in the birth area thin substantially.
#     - Youngest brother Urch dies at Nora ~39 (year -9413); reinforces Nora’s sense
#       that alliances fail and only immediate household matters.
#     phase: Mature adult
#   - age_range: 56-78
#     key_events:
#     - 'Becomes a valued but abrasive elder: teaches processing, routes, and taboo
#       exceptions; is avoided for comfort but consulted for specifics.'
#     - Adult daughters manage most social glue in the multigenerational camp; Nora’s
#       partner Mira buffers her conflicts with others.
#     - Progressive degenerative decline (joint pain, stiffness, weakness) limits foraging;
#       she dies in year -9374 at age 78 after a prolonged period of reduced mobility.
#     phase: Old age / elderhood
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: 'Kori’s mate: Pala'
#     prominence: Childhood to young adulthood (before relocation), mentioned later
#       as distant kin tie.

#     relationship: One of Mira’s brothers; skeptical of Nora and periodically threatens
#       to expel her after conflicts.

#     relationship_start_year: -9432
#   - name: Mira
#     narrative_role: Primary late-life partner from age ~25 until death. A calmer,

#     name: Sama
#     narrative_role: Oldest sister; took on early childcare and teaching in the extended-family
#       camp. Nora resented her bossiness yet relied on her skills; Sama’s death (likely

#     death_year: -9436
#     name: Nima
#     narrative_role: Younger brother; sickly/accident-prone. Nora is intermittently

#       a point of blame within the family.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: -9446
#     death_age: 4
#     death_year: -9442
#     name: Erch
#     narrative_role: Younger sister; attached to Nora despite Nora’s roughness. Her

#   - birth_year: -9444
#     death_age: 31
#     death_year: -9413
#     name: Urch
#     narrative_role: Youngest brother; grew up in Nora’s shadow and feared her temper.
#       In adolescence he becomes a rival for attention/resources; his early adult death
#       reinforces Nora’s distrust of stability.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Chronic conflicts; partial social isolation; higher likelihood of
#       sanctions after the assault; dependence on partner and daughters to smooth relations.
#     scene: She openly refuses sharing expectations when she believes others did not
#       'earn' the food, and she uses intimidation to end disputes rather than negotiation.
#     timing: Visible from childhood; peaks in young adulthood during relocation.
#     trait: Agreeableness extremely low (0th percentile)
#   - consequence: Others see her as unreliable; contributes to blame after a younger
#       sibling’s mishap and later friction in her new band.
#     scene: She neglects routine maintenance (letting baskets/cordage go unrepaired
#       until failure), ignores agreed camp chores, and takes impulsive foraging detours
#       that inconvenience others.
#     timing: Adolescence through mid-adulthood.
#     trait: Conscientiousness very low (4th percentile)
#   - consequence: Reputation for taking more than her share; escalates disputes over
#       resources (including the assault incident).
#     scene: She keeps the best cutting edge or a favored cached tool for herself, downplays
#       others’ contributions, and uses sharp bargaining in exchanges of meat/processed
#       foods.
#     timing: Young adult through old age.
#     trait: Honesty-Humility low (10th percentile)
#   - consequence: Fewer friendships; relies on kin/partner rather than broad alliances;
#       makes relocation socially harder.
#     scene: Prefers solitary gathering routes and sits at the edge of group talk; speaks
#       briefly and bluntly, often only to correct or command.
#     timing: All phases, especially adolescence onward.
#     trait: Extraversion low (10th percentile)
#   - consequence: Social sanctions after violent incidents; elevated risk of displacement/relocation;
#       ongoing need for household members to manage fallout.
#     scene: Repeated rule-testing (taking from caches, violating taboo areas), quick
#       escalation to threats, and willingness to use violence to settle disputes.
#     timing: Emerges clearly in adolescence; most consequential in ages 20-30; persists
#       as verbal aggression in old age.
#     trait: Externalizing/personality-pathology-like pattern (antisocial/disruptive-impulsive
#       analog)
#   - consequence: Easier use of force in disputes; contributes to fear-based deference
#       rather than affection; shapes her 'dangerous elder' reputation.
#     scene: As a teen and adult she is physically imposing; others give her space during
#       arguments, and she is sometimes recruited for intimidating tasks (guarding caches,
#       confronting outsiders).
#     timing: Adolescence through adulthood.
#     trait: Very tall stature (99th percentile)
# number_of_children: '6'
# number_of_siblings: '7'
# occupation: Generalist gatherer and food-processor (plant foods, small fauna; cooking/processing;
#   core subsistence work)
# religion: 'Animistic daily practices: respect/propitiation of animal, ancestor, and

---

Nora was born into an interior Central American forager band that moved between ridges and stream valleys in the dry broadleaf forests. Her people spoke an early form of the Misumalpan line, and they marked danger and good luck with small, practical rites: a pinch of ground seed dropped into a spring, a whisper to a ridge-spirit before crossing, a smear of fat on a stone where an ancestor’s bones were said to rest.

She was born into a crowded camp. Her mother, Tali, carried a digging stick and a baby sling as often as she carried a basket. Her father, Chol, hunted deer and smaller game, brought back marrow bones, and kept a few good stone edges wrapped in fiber. Nora’s grandmother, Elcha, shared the shelter and had a way of insisting on quiet when the fire was being fed. Nora’s oldest sister, Sama, was already old enough to be given tasks and to give orders; her older brother Kori followed Chol on short walks and learned what a broken point looked like. A second sister, Petch, had been born and lost the same day two years earlier. The adults spoke her name softly and then moved on.

Nora grew fast and grew tall. By the time she could carry a small basket, she pushed past children who blocked her and grabbed what she wanted without asking. Sama corrected her and got a shove for it. Elcha stopped fights by pulling Nora’s wrist hard and making her sit on the bare ground until she was calm. Nora learned plant names from Elcha because those lessons put food in her hands. She stopped listening when the lesson turned to warnings about sharing and restraint.

In the early mornings, Tali took Nora and Sama to dig for roots in sandy patches where moisture held. Nora liked the work where she could spread out from others. She ate roasted seeds while she walked, the gritty taste stuck in her teeth, and she kept the best handful for herself unless someone watched. She avoided long camp talk. When people laughed, it was usually at someone else’s clumsiness, and she joined in when the joke was sharp.

More children followed. A sister, Olt, lived a year and died. A brother, Nima, was born when Nora was four; he cried often and was hard to settle. Another sister, Erch, followed, then the youngest, Urch. Nora remembered Erch clinging to her leg and wanting to be carried. Nora dragged her along by the arm instead. Erch died before her fifth birthday, sick for days and then gone. When the band visited the spring afterward, Elcha made the children drop a few crushed seeds into the water and speak the names of dead kin. Nora did it because Elcha watched, and because the spring mattered.

At fifteen, Elcha died after a season of coughing and pain in her ribs. With the old woman gone, Tali's patience thinned and Sama took over the scolding and rule-making. Nora responded by ignoring chores and leaving camp without telling anyone. She returned with food and acted as if that settled everything. It never did.

Nima died when Nora was sixteen. He went out with her and Urch to gather fallen fruit near a rocky cut, and he did not come back. He was found below a low ledge with a broken neck. The adults argued about why he had been there at all. Tali turned on Nora, demanding what she had been doing, why she had let him climb. Nora gave short answers, then none. Kori struck her once across the shoulder for her silence. Nora did not cry or apologize. After that, Urch watched her carefully and kept his distance when her mood turned.

At twenty, Nora took up with Anch, a man from a neighboring cluster of camps who visited during a season when game was scarce and people traded dried meat for woven baskets. He liked her height and her directness. She liked that he did not ask for softness. Their pairing was treated as real once he began sleeping in her family’s shelter and bringing meat to Tali. The next year Nora bore a daughter, Och. Nora carried the infant on her hip while she worked, and when the baby cried too long, she passed her to Sama without thanks.

Two years later she had Nalu, and the camp began to press on her. Tali wanted more help. Sama wanted compliance. Anch wanted Nora to keep the peace with his kin when they visited. Nora reacted by walking farther for food and returning late. She broke a basket and did not replace it. She left a stone edge out in the rain and then blamed a child. Anch and Nora fought in front of others. He tried to restrain her once, and she bit his forearm hard enough to leave scars.

When Nora was twenty-four, she left her birth territory. She took Och and Nalu and went with Mira, a calmer man with a wide web of kin in a different ecozone beyond the familiar ridges. Anch did not follow. Kori argued with her at the edge of camp and told her she would not be welcome back if she brought trouble. Nora walked off without looking behind.

The destination band’s dry-season camp sat near stands of fruiting trees that everyone watched carefully. Nora did not accept their quiet claims. At twenty-five, she argued with Osk, another adult woman, over who had rights to a productive patch and over a cached stone tool wrapped in fiber and hidden under brush. Voices rose. Osk reached for the tool bundle. Nora struck her with a digging stick across the upper arm, then grabbed her and drove her down. The fight turned into grappling in the dirt until others pulled Nora away. Ench, an older man who mediated disputes, forced Nora to give up part of her gathered food to Osk’s family and barred her from that tree stand for a stretch of days. Mira's brother Iru warned her that another outburst would bring banishment. Nora accepted the sanction with a flat stare and then went to forage alone, farther out.

Her third daughter, Kina, was born when Nora was twenty-six. The next year Chol died back in the birth territory. News traveled with visitors who knew Kori. Nora said little, but she saved a portion of dried fruit and dropped it into the nearest spring, speaking her father’s name once. Mira watched and said nothing.

Two infant sons followed: Ola when Nora was twenty-eight, Pel two years later. Both died within days of birth. The women in the camp washed the small bodies and placed them in shallow ground away from the main sleeping area. Nora did not linger at the pit. She returned to the fire and asked for food.

At thirty-three she bore Sola, a daughter who stayed close and laughed easily. Sola became the child who could touch Nora without being shoved away. That same year, Nora’s oldest sister Sama died in the old territory. Nora heard months later. She told Och to stop asking for stories about Sama and sent a small bundle of dried meat with a visitor as a gesture to her mother.

Urch died when Nora was thirty-nine. Tali died when Nora was forty-two. The last message from home carried more accusation than warmth. Nora did not return. She stayed with Mira's people and with the daughters who were now old enough to work beside her. When word came that Kori had died, the last of her siblings in the old territory, she did not send anything back.

Middle age made Nora useful in ways she could not ruin with temper. She knew where certain roots held moisture late into the dry season. She taught the young women how to roast seeds without burning them and how to use ash to keep insects off drying racks. People avoided her when they wanted comfort, but they asked her when they needed a straight answer. Her camp pleasures stayed simple: roasted tubers eaten quickly while standing, or the gritty paste of crushed seeds mixed with fat. She sat where she could see the paths into camp. She hated idle talk behind her back and turned abruptly when she heard it.

Sola died at seventeen, taken by a sudden sickness after a cold night and a day of vomiting. Nora slapped a bowl out of someone’s hand when they offered soothing herbs. Later she walked to the spring alone, dropped crushed seed into the water, and spoke Sola’s name until her voice went hoarse.

In old age, Nora’s height remained, but her joints stiffened and her hands lost strength. She stopped traveling far and worked close to the fire, stripping fibers, sorting seeds, and directing grandchildren in clipped commands. Och organized much of the household, and Nalu handled disputes with neighbors. Kina argued with Nora openly, and Nora answered in the same blunt tone. Mira stayed with her. He slept near her, carried water when she demanded it, and used his kin ties to keep her conflicts from flaring into expulsion.

Nora's body failed slowly. Her world narrowed to the camp edge and the fire. She died at seventy-eight after a season when she could no longer rise without help. The household placed her body in the ground on a slope above the camp, tucked a stone edge and a small bundle of dried fruit beside her, and poured water from a gourd onto the soil while speaking her name and the names of her dead children.
