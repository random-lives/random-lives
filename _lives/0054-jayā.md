# historical_context:
# - event: Seasonal monsoon flooding and river-course instability on the Kosi–Ganga
#     plain causing periodic crop loss, damaged huts, and disrupted access to fields
#     and grazing
#   timing: ages 0–6 (especially each monsoon, Jun–Sep)
# - event: Shifts in local revenue extraction (assessment, collections, or corvée-style
#     demands) due to changing regional overlords/administrative arrangements in late-11th-century
#     Bihar
#   timing: ages 0–6
# - event: Expansion/maintenance of Brahmanical temple networks and associated festival
#     obligations (offerings, labor, dues) shaping village calendars and communal duties
#   timing: ages 0–6 (annual cycles)
# household_social_status: Smallholding peasant/tenant cultivator (modest means, some
#   stability)
# household_structure_at_birth: 'Female-headed household: widowed/abandoned mother with
#   child (father deceased/absent at birth)'

#   later Maithili/Magahi/Bhojpuri)
# literacy: Neither read nor write
# mental_disorder: Neurodevelopmental disorder / global developmental delay or intellectual
#   developmental disorder (mild)
# migration: Stayed in birth settlement/its immediate fields

#   fieldwork on family/tenanted plots'
# narrative_plan:
#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Dhanī
#     narrative_role: Primary caretaker and farm worker; emotionally stretched by widowhood/abandonment
#       and repeated infant losses. Relationship with Jayā is protective but often tense—she
#       relies on Jayā for small help and scolds quickly when Jayā’s fearfulness or
#       impulsiveness creates risk.
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Rāmū
#     narrative_role: Lives in the same hamlet or a nearby one and is present seasonally
#       (childbirth help, festivals, illness). Provides warmth and practical knowledge
#       (herbs, stories, small rituals), giving Jayā a sense of safety when the mother
#       is in the fields.
#     role: maternal grandmother
#   - death_year: 1085
#     name: Unknown/unnamed
#     narrative_role: Not part of Jayā’s daily life; his absence shapes household vulnerability
#       and explains why women’s labor and kin support matter so much.
#     role: father (absent/deceased)
#   - death_year: null
#     name: Vīrū
#     narrative_role: Intermittent male support figure (helps with ploughing arrangements,
#       dealing with collectors, repairs). Jayā is curious and talkative around him;
#       he is sometimes kind, sometimes impatient.
#     role: maternal uncle (mother’s brother)
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 2
#     connection: Begins after repeated bouts of stomach upset during/after monsoon
#       seasons; worsens food insecurity when floods disrupt rice stores and increases
#       the mother’s reliance on home remedies and temple vows.
#     incident: chronic_illness
#   - age: 5
#     connection: Occurs during monsoon when women go to the pond/canal; ties to chronic
#       frailty (weakness, poor balance) and intensifies Jayā’s fear of water/being
#       separated, contributing to later episodes of panic during fever seasons.
#     incident: serious_accident
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Śobhā
#     prominence: age ~5 (monsoon accident episode) and occasional mentions during women’s
#       work gatherings
#     relationship: neighbor woman who fetches water with Jayā’s mother; helps pull
#       Jayā from the pond/canal
#   - name: Deva Miśra
#     prominence: ages 2–6 (during illness bouts and festival obligations)
#     relationship: local Brahmin/ritual specialist associated with the village shrine
#       who accepts small offerings and prescribes vows/ritual remedies
#   - name: Harī
#     prominence: ages 3–6 (everyday play and conflicts showing low agreeableness)
#     relationship: older village child (boy) who teases Jayā and sometimes leads games
#       near the fields/pond
#   - name: Kālu
#     prominence: intermittent ages 3–6 (context scenes about dues and household anxiety)
#     relationship: revenue collector’s assistant/retainer seen during assessments;
#       a figure of fear for households like Jayā’s
#   siblings:
#   - birth_year: 1085
#     death_age: 6
#     death_year: 1092
#     name: Jayā
#     narrative_role: Protagonist; the eldest child who tries to insert herself into
#       adult tasks and stories but is physically fragile and easily frightened; alternates
#       between bold, talkative bursts and sudden panic.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: 1087
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 1087
#     name: Gaurī
#     narrative_role: First infant loss after Jayā; remembered mainly through the mother’s
#       rituals and grief, shaping Jayā’s fear of sickness and separation.

#   - birth_year: 1089
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 1089
#     name: Nanda
#     narrative_role: Briefly lived baby brother; his birth/death becomes a household
#       marker for bad seasons and reinforces the sense that children can vanish quickly.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1091
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 1091
#     name: Sītā
#     narrative_role: Third infant death; Jayā is old enough to notice the hush around
#       childbirth and the way women gather and then disperse.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: 1093
#     death_age: 24
#     death_year: 1117
#     name: Kamalā
#     narrative_role: Youngest sister (born after Jayā’s death); included for timeline
#       completeness only—she does not overlap in life, but later family memory of Jayā
#       may be carried to her by the mother.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Adults sometimes indulge her curiosity, but others call her 'restless'
#       or 'odd'; she wanders toward interesting sights (pond edge, ritual gatherings),
#       increasing risk.
#     scene: Jayā pesters her grandmother and passing pilgrims/temple-goers with questions
#       about gods, animals, and faraway rivers; she imitates songs and rituals creatively
#       (mixing chants, making little clay figures) rather than repeating them exactly.
#     timing: ages 3–6 (festival days, evenings at the hearth)
#     trait: Openness (very high, 97th percentile)
#   - consequence: Frequent conflict with mother (who needs her to be steady) and heightened
#       distress during sickness; after the pond accident she becomes more fearful of
#       water and separation.
#     scene: She startles easily at thunder, shouting, or barking dogs; she clings to
#       her mother when strangers (collectors/retainers) appear and has intense crying
#       spells when left with other women.
#     timing: ages 2–6 (especially monsoon storms and illness periods)
#     trait: Neuroticism (very high, 98th percentile)
#   - consequence: Other children avoid her at times; adults label her 'sharp-tongued,'
#       leading to harsher scolding and fewer playmates—she stays closer to adults,
#       which also feeds her curiosity and exposure to adult worries.
#     scene: In play with other children she grabs desired items, refuses to share,
#       and snaps back at older girls; she can be affectionate but quickly turns combative
#       when corrected.
#     timing: ages 3–6 (daily village play, work-adjacent chores)
#     trait: Agreeableness (very low, 15th percentile)
#   - consequence: Mother keeps her from more complex chores and watches her closely;
#       other children tease her, and her vulnerability contributes to the pond accident
#       and to chronic illness management (difficulty remembering hygiene/food cautions).
#     scene: She learns practical sequences slowly (tying a bundle, counting measures
#       of grain) and struggles to follow multi-step instructions; she speaks a lot
#       but with muddled timing and misunderstandings, and she remains physically small/awkward
#       for her age.
#     timing: noticed from ages 3–4 onward; persistent through age 6
#     trait: Neurodevelopmental disorder / mild global developmental delay (plus low
#       intelligence, 15th percentile)
#   - consequence: Makes her visible and sometimes endearing, but also draws reprimands
#       for 'getting underfoot' and places her in situations where fear can flip into
#       panic.
#     scene: When not frightened, she is socially bold—approaches visitors, chatters
#       loudly at the well/pond, and inserts herself into women’s conversations.
#     timing: ages 3–6 (market/festival days, communal tasks)
#     trait: Extraversion (high, 80th percentile)
# number_of_siblings: '4'
# religion: Household & village Brahmanical Hindu practice (puja/offerings at home;
#   participation in local temple rites; festivals/fasts)
# sibling_ages_at_death:
# - 0
# - 0
# - 0
# - 24
# sibling_sexes:
# - F
# - M
# - F
# - F
# structured_incidents:
# - event: While following her mother and other women to the village pond/canal to fetch
#     water and rinse rice, she slipped on the muddy bank and was pulled out coughing
#     and exhausted; she then spent many days weak with fever and chest trouble and
#     could not help with small chores.
#   reasoning: Rural children faced risks like falls, burns, animal injuries, and near-drowning,
#     but in a short 0–6 lifespan serious accidents causing weeks of incapacity were
#     less common than severe infections.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: around age 4–5 (monsoon season)
#   type: serious_accident
# - event: From toddlerhood she was often thin and easily tired, with recurring bouts
#     of stomach upset and worms that left her with a swollen belly and poor appetite;
#     between episodes she improved but never became as robust as other children in
#     the hamlet.
#   reasoning: Endemic parasitic burdens and recurrent respiratory/gastrointestinal
#     disease could become long-running, and her mild developmental delay increases
#     the chance of ongoing limitations recognized as chronic frailty.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: recurring pattern from about age 2 until death at age 6
#   type: chronic_illness

Jayā was born at the end of 1085 in a hamlet on the low fields of the middle Ganga plain, where officials came to measure dues and where the river’s floodwater could remake paths between one season and the next. Her family kept a small plot under tenancy. Her father was already gone, so her mother Dhanī carried headship herself, leaning on her brother Vīrū when collectors' assistants like Kālu came calling. Dhanī's mother Rāmū lived nearby and came often—bringing herbs, taking Jayā into her lap while Dhanī worked in the fields, and telling stories about river spirits and the gods.

Dhanī rose before light to sweep the yard, smear the hearth, and set a pinch of rice and a dab of ghee before a small clay image near the wall. On some mornings she added a marigold and water for Durgā, asking for children who would live. Jayā hovered close, asking what each offering meant and why the priest Deva Miśra rang his bell three times instead of four. She talked over adults, then snapped at other children when they laughed at her questions or took her bit of roasted gram. Harī once pushed her away from a game; she kicked dust at his feet and screamed until an older girl dragged her aside.

A sister, Gaurī, was born in 1087 and died within days. By the next year Jayā's belly often sat swollen above thin legs. She complained of cramps, ate a little, then begged for sweets again. Dhanī boiled bitter leaves and pressed her to drink; Rāmū came with herb mixtures and sat with her granddaughter while the mother worked. Jayā forgot instructions and dropped grain she was meant to carry, then cried hard when scolded. A baby boy, Nanda, was born in 1089 and died the same year.

During the monsoon of 1090, Jayā followed Dhanī and the neighbor Śobhā to the pond where they rinsed rice. She slid on the slick bank and went under; Śobhā hauled her up by the arm. Jayā coughed and shook for days afterward, feverish and short of breath, refusing to go near water. In 1091 another sister, Sītā, was born and died soon after.

In early 1092 the fever season returned. Jayā was carried inside, sweating and shivering. Dhanī fed her sips of water and prayed at the hearth; Rāmū sat beside them through the nights. Jayā died on February 18. Her body was taken to the burning place near the river, where Dhanī, Rāmū, and Vīrū placed rice and sesame before the pyre was lit.

<!--
**Issues found:**
- [Pass 4] Grandmother Rāmū introduced as important caretaker but disappeared after para 1
- [Pass 8] Chronology jumbled: sibling deaths (1087-1091) and illness (1088) not in order; pond accident (1090) came after 1091 sibling death
- [Pass 14] "carried out to the sun" unclear/poetic phrasing for infant death
- [Pass 14] "wrapped and taken away before Jayā understood why women whispered" overly evocative AI-style phrasing
- [Pass 14] "Eastern Indo-Aryan village tongue" reads like a textbook

**Changes made:**
- Added Rāmū to illness scene (para 3) and death/funeral scene (para 6) for consistent character tracking
- Restructured chronology: moved sibling deaths to chronological positions (Gaurī 1087, Nanda 1089, Sītā 1091) interspersed with illness and pond accident
- Changed "before she could be carried out to the sun" → "within days" (clearer, plainer)
- Changed "wrapped and taken away before Jayā understood why women whispered" → "was born and died soon after" (direct prose)
- Removed "Her family spoke an Eastern Indo-Aryan village tongue" (unnecessary textbook detail)
