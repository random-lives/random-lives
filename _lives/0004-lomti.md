# ethnicity: Munda-speaking (Austroasiatic) communities in the broader central Indian
#   hinterland
# father_occupation: Trader/caravan-related (periodic long-distance or regional trade
#   in grain, salt, livestock, forest products)
# historical_context:
# - event: Post-Aśokan political fragmentation and contestation (declining Mauryan cohesion
#     after c. 232 BCE), increasing local uncertainty—banditry/raiding risk, shifting
#     petty rulers, and irregular extraction on frontier villages and caravan routes.
#   timing: adolescence through midlife (c. ages 10–45)
# - event: Monsoon variability causing at least one serious multi-season drought or
#     rainfall failure in the region, leading to poor harvests, distress sales of grain/livestock,
#     and heightened food prices.
#   timing: anytime, but most likely midlife (c. ages 20–55)
# - event: Localized crop pest outbreaks (locusts/caterpillars) or plant disease affecting
#     dry-season stores and kharif crops, producing short but sharp subsistence stress
#     in rural households.
#   timing: intermittent across life (c. ages 5–65)
# - event: Expansion and normalization of money/markets under Mauryan-era economic integration
#     (greater use of coin, standardized weights, more regular market days), affecting
#     grain pricing, debt relationships, and small-scale trade opportunities.

#     incident: sick_relative
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-9
#     key_events:
#     - Grows up in a patrilocal nuclear household near husband’s kin cluster; father
#       often absent on caravan circuits.
#     - Learns intensive household work early as more siblings arrive and several die
#       young.
#     - First exposures to market-day bustle and caravan talk through father’s network
#       (coins/weights as curiosities rather than literacy).
#     phase: Early childhood in natal hamlet (Kachra Kheri area)
#   - age_range: 10-17
#     key_events:
#     - Household anxiety increases with post-Aśokan unrest; rumors of tolls/raids on
#       routes and shifting local demands.
#     - Teen Lomti becomes outspoken and socially bold, helping negotiate with neighbors/kin
#       while mother works; starts tasting/using fermented drink at gatherings.
#     - Likely betrothal and marriage arrangements begin; preparation for moving to
#       husband’s settlement.
#     phase: Later childhood & adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-32
#     key_events:
#     - Marries Ragho (~-225) and relocates; begins life as household manager while
#       husband travels.
#     - Endures multiple pregnancies, including a late miscarriage and three infant
#       deaths, amid periodic crop stress and price swings.
#     - At least one relocation linked to trade opportunities/insecurity; household
#       ties to caravan lodging increase exposure to outsiders.
#     phase: 'Young adulthood: marriage, childbirth, and early moves'
#   - age_range: 33-55
#     key_events:
#     - Returns seasonally to natal hamlet to care for aging father and assist mother
#       (-208 to -204).
#     - Political fragmentation and route insecurity peak; drought/pest years force
#       difficult provisioning decisions and perhaps debt.
#     - During a later move, Ragho falls into a long wasting illness (-195 to -192);
#       Lomti carries the household load and his death sets up later decline.
#     phase: 'Midlife: caregiving, instability, and declining household fortune'
#   - age_range: 56-72
#     key_events:
#     - Lives as a widow; dependence shifts to relatives as her adult children die (-188
#       and -176), leaving her without direct support.
#     - Alcohol misuse becomes more entrenched; reputation suffers and she is treated
#       as burdensome or untrustworthy in some households.

#     scene: On market days and when caravans camp nearby, Lomti is the one who talks
#       first—haggling loudly, trading gossip, and hosting travelers with confident
#       familiarity.
#     timing: adolescence through midlife (ages 14-45)
#     trait: Extraversion (85th percentile)
#   - consequence: Contributes to household conflict, worsens outcomes during drought/pest
#       years, and makes her seem unreliable as a widow dependent.
#     scene: She postpones threshing/grain-storage tasks, improvises rations day-to-day,
#       and breaks agreed routines, leaving others to repair shortages or redo work.
#     timing: young adulthood onward (ages 18-60)
#     trait: Very low Conscientiousness (7th percentile)
#   - consequence: Weakens support from in-laws; increases likelihood she must move
#       between relatives’ households later.
#     scene: She argues sharply with co-wives/affinal kin and responds to criticism
#       with counter-accusations rather than apology, escalating domestic disputes.
#     timing: young adulthood through widowhood (ages 20-70)
#     trait: Low Agreeableness (19th percentile)
#   - consequence: Reinforces a reputation for being slippery/untrustworthy, deepening
#       marginalization after widowhood.
#     scene: She takes extra grain from shared stores 'for the children' and minimizes
#       it when confronted; she is also quick to flatter or mislead to secure small
#       favors.
#     timing: midlife to old age (ages 35-72)
#     trait: Low Honesty-Humility (11th percentile)
#   - consequence: Limits ability to manage accounts/credit cleanly; increases susceptibility
#       to being cheated in petty exchanges and to debt spirals.
#     scene: She struggles with remembering quantities and sequences in multi-step processing
#       (e.g., timing of soaking/fermenting or dividing stores), relying on others’
#       guidance and repeating simple rules.
#     timing: throughout life, most visible in early adulthood (ages 18-35)
#     trait: Low Intelligence (14th percentile)
#   - consequence: Increases accidents/illness risk, worsens household conflict, and
#       contributes to social disfavor and dependence in old age.
#     scene: What begins as drinking at festivals becomes frequent use after stressful
#       years; she hides small pots of fermented drink, drinks in the morning, and becomes
#       verbally aggressive or neglectful when intoxicated.
#     timing: onset late adolescence/early adulthood (ages 16-25), escalation after
#       husband’s illness and widowhood (ages 47-72)
#     trait: Substance-related disorder (alcohol/fermented drink misuse)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During one of her household moves, her husband developed a long wasting illness
#     with recurrent fever and cough; she nursed him at home, preparing thin gruels
#     and herbal decoctions and managing smoke-and-heat treatments while still keeping
#     the hearth and grain stores.
#   reasoning: High morbidity and limited formal care meant households relied on women
#     for prolonged nursing of fever, chronic infection, injury, or alcohol-related
#     illness in relatives.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 46–49
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: After her father could no longer travel with caravans due to failing sight
#     and weakness, she spent seasons in her natal hamlet helping her mother with grinding
#     grain, fetching water, and arranging care through kin while her father stayed
#     mostly indoors.
#   reasoning: As the eldest child in a large family and a household organizer, she
#     had a meaningful chance of caring for an aging parent or in-law, especially if
#     she remained near kin during part of adulthood.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 33–37
#   type: elderly_parents
# - event: While her husband was away on a regional trading circuit, she began a discreet
#     liaison with a caravan guard who lodged near their kin compound, meeting at night
#     by the cattle enclosure during the dry season.
#   reasoning: Mobility, possible marital strain, and later-life vulnerability (including
#     coercion) make at least one extramarital episode relatively plausible even if
#     concealed.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 28–30
#   type: extramarital_sex
# - event: One pregnancy ended in a late miscarriage with heavy bleeding and days of
#     fever; older women in the settlement treated her with warm compresses, massage,
#     and astringent plant preparations while she was kept from heavy work for several
#     weeks.
#   reasoning: In a high-mortality childbirth environment, miscarriage/stillbirth or
#     dangerous complications are common across multiple pregnancies; having 5 live
#     births implies additional pregnancies are possible.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 24–25

Lomti was born in 242 BCE in a small hamlet in the dry forests and fields of what is now southeast Rajasthan, where rainfed grain and grazing fed most households. The Mauryan kingdom reached this frontier through tax demands, road watchers, and officials who measured grain and counted cattle, not through palaces. Lomti’s family spoke a Munda tongue at home and used an Indo‑Aryan vernacular in markets and with outsiders.

Her father, Buruŋ, spent many seasons on caravan circuits. He carried salt, grain, and ghee and returned with cloth, beads, and small amounts of metal. When he was away, Lomti’s mother, Sāini, ran the hearth and yard. Lomti learned early to lift water jars, watch the cooking fire, and keep the grain from damp. She also learned how to talk. When traders camped near the settlement, she hovered at the edge of the men’s talk and copied their easy bargaining tone. She loved market days for the noise and for fried cakes bought hot and eaten fast before anyone demanded a share.

She was the first of ten children. In 240 BCE, a brother was born and died in the same year. Another brother came in 238 BCE and lived long enough to chase goats and complain loudly; he died in 224 BCE, fourteen years old. A sister born in 236 BCE died at one. More births followed with short gaps: Kiriŋ in 234 BCE, then another brother in 232 BCE who died at nine. Two sisters came next, Riniŋ in 230 BCE and another in 228 BCE. The younger sister died in 192 BCE at thirty-six. A brother born in 226 BCE lived into old age. The youngest sister, born in 224 BCE, died in 193 BCE at thirty-one. The compound never had quiet.

Lomti’s adolescence unfolded as Mauryan control loosened after Aśoka’s death. Men with authority changed from season to season. Some demanded a toll at a stream crossing. Others pressed for labor on a track, then vanished when a rival group appeared. Caravans began to travel in tighter clusters. Lomti listened to her father’s stories and repeated them with extra detail, turning them into jokes that made the other girls laugh and the older women scold her for being too bold.

By sixteen she drank fermented grain beer at weddings and at post-harvest gatherings. She liked the warmth in her belly and the way it loosened her tongue. She also began to miss mornings. Sāini shook her awake, furious, and Lomti snapped back instead of lowering her eyes.

In 225 BCE, at seventeen, Lomti married Ragho, a small trader who moved between villages and market towns, and she left her natal hamlet. Ragho’s kin lived near a road used by caravans. The household was not rich, but it had surplus in good years: extra grain, a few cattle, and stores of ghee sealed in pots. Ragho traveled for weeks at a time. Lomti became the one who kept the hearth, arranged grinding, and decided how much grain could be carried to market.

A son was born in 224 BCE and died the same day. A daughter born in 222 BCE died as well. Lomti argued with Ragho’s older female relatives when they spoke of omens and blame. She refused some of the restrictions they tried to impose and then paid for it when they stopped helping her on hard days.

In 218 BCE, when she was twenty-four, she carried another pregnancy into the late months and then lost it. Blood ran for hours. Fever followed. Older women, led by a healer named Jomā, pressed warm cloths to her belly, rubbed her limbs with oil, and gave her bitter astringent preparations. Lomti lay on a mat near the cooking place and was kept from lifting or grinding for weeks. When she could stand, she went back to work too soon and fainted once while carrying water. She denied it happened.

Two years later, in 220 BCE, a drought struck. The rains failed twice. The stored grain shrank. Ragho began taking loans in coin and in measured grain, promising repayment after the next harvest. Lomti hated the counting and could not hold numbers in her head. When a lender repeated figures, she fumbled and answered too fast, and Ragho snapped at her in front of others. On market days she compensated by talking louder, pushing into conversations, and trying to turn bargaining into performance.

A daughter, Jili, was born in 219 BCE and lived. A son, Kandu, followed in 217 BCE. Another daughter was born in 214 BCE and died in infancy. In the same years, pests hit the crops more than once—caterpillars in stored grain and a sudden stripping of young plants after an early rain. Each shock tightened the household. Lomti hid small amounts of beer in a covered pot and drank in the mornings when she felt trapped. When caught, she accused others of stealing it.

In 213 BCE, at twenty-nine, Ragho left on a longer circuit. A caravan guard named Māto lodged near the kin compound for several nights while his group waited for others to assemble. Lomti spoke with him by the cattle enclosure while she checked ropes and fodder. She met him again after dark, once, then again. She chose the nights when Ragho’s relatives were drunk or asleep. The affair ran into the next dry season and ended in 211 BCE when the caravan moved on and gossip sharpened. Lomti fought with an in-law who hinted at it, and the quarrel did not heal.

In 208 BCE, when Lomti was thirty-four, Buruŋ’s eyesight failed and his legs weakened. He stopped joining caravans. Lomti returned to her natal hamlet for seasons at a time, from 208 to 204 BCE, helping Sāini grind grain and haul water, and arranging for Kiriŋ and other kin to share the burden. Buruŋ sat indoors, fingering a set of trade beads he no longer carried. Lomti resented the slow pace of care and sometimes disappeared to the edge of the fields to drink with a cousin, then returned louder than she left.

Political control shifted again as local powerholders pressed in. Different men claimed the right to collect. Ragho responded by moving the household. In 196 BCE they left one settlement for another closer to a safer route. During the move Ragho fell ill, coughing for weeks and sweating through nights. Fever returned in cycles. Lomti kept him on a mat, fed him thin gruel, and boiled herbs into sharp-smelling drinks. She held a cloth over a small pot and made him breathe the hot vapor. Between feedings she guarded the grain jars and scolded children who took handfuls without asking.

The illness dragged on through 195 and 194 BCE. Debt grew. Ragho died in 193 BCE. In the same year Lomti’s youngest sister died at thirty-one. Lomti was fifty and a widow with two living children and little surplus. The relatives who might have protected her remembered old quarrels. She moved again, into another kin household, then another, as obligations shifted.

Jili died in 188 BCE at thirty-one. Kandu died in 176 BCE at forty-one. Lomti outlived them both. With no children to claim her labor and feed her, she lived as a dependent among relatives, most often in the wider household of her sister Riniŋ. She still did work when her body allowed: grinding, stirring pots, sorting dry grain, and watching small children. She also drank more openly. Some mornings she started before the sun cleared the trees. When challenged, she answered with sharp insults and half-truths, then demanded more food than she was offered.

Old age brought stiffness in her knees and swelling in her hands. She sat near the hearth because it eased her joints. She still enjoyed market days when someone would take her along; she talked at strangers, asked questions that irritated others, and laughed too loudly at her own stories. She hated being told to sit quietly.

In 170 BCE, during the cooler season, she stopped eating much. She spent more time lying down and less time at the grinding stone. In November 170 BCE, in her seventy-second year, she died in her relatives’ house after days of failing strength.
