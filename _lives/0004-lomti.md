# ethnicity: Munda-speaking (Austroasiatic) communities in the broader central Indian
#   hinterland
# father_occupation: Trader/caravan-related (periodic long-distance or regional trade
#   in grain, salt, livestock, forest products)
# historical_context:
# - event: Post-Aśokan political fragmentation and contestation (declining Mauryan cohesion
#     after c. 232 BCE), increasing local uncertainty—banditry/raiding risk, shifting
#     petty rulers, and irregular extraction on frontier villages and caravan routes.
#   timing: adolescence through midlife (c. ages 10–45)
# - event: Monsoon variability causing at least one serious multi-season drought or
#     rainfall failure in the region, leading to poor harvests, distress sales of grain/livestock,
#     and heightened food prices.
#   timing: anytime, but most likely midlife (c. ages 20–55)
# - event: Localized crop pest outbreaks (locusts/caterpillars) or plant disease affecting
#     dry-season stores and kharif crops, producing short but sharp subsistence stress
#     in rural households.
#   timing: intermittent across life (c. ages 5–65)
# - event: Expansion and normalization of money/markets under Mauryan-era economic integration
#     (greater use of coin, standardized weights, more regular market days), affecting
#     grain pricing, debt relationships, and small-scale trade opportunities.
#   timing: young adulthood to midlife (c. ages 15–50)

#     incident: sick_relative
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-9
#     key_events:
#     - Grows up in a patrilocal nuclear household near husband’s kin cluster; father
#       often absent on caravan circuits.
#     - Learns intensive household work early as more siblings arrive and several die
#       young.
#     - First exposures to market-day bustle and caravan talk through father’s network
#       (coins/weights as curiosities rather than literacy).
#     phase: Early childhood in natal hamlet (Kachra Kheri area)
#   - age_range: 10-17
#     key_events:
#     - Household anxiety increases with post-Aśokan unrest; rumors of tolls/raids on
#       routes and shifting local demands.
#     - Teen Lomti becomes outspoken and socially bold, helping negotiate with neighbors/kin
#       while mother works; starts tasting/using fermented drink at gatherings.
#     - Likely betrothal and marriage arrangements begin; preparation for moving to
#       husband’s settlement.
#     phase: Later childhood & adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-32
#     key_events:
#     - Marries Ragho (~-225) and relocates; begins life as household manager while
#       husband travels.
#     - Endures multiple pregnancies, including a late miscarriage and three infant
#       deaths, amid periodic crop stress and price swings.
#     - At least one relocation linked to trade opportunities/insecurity; household
#       ties to caravan lodging increase exposure to outsiders.
#     phase: 'Young adulthood: marriage, childbirth, and early moves'
#   - age_range: 33-55
#     key_events:
#     - Returns seasonally to natal hamlet to care for aging father and assist mother
#       (-208 to -204).
#     - Political fragmentation and route insecurity peak; drought/pest years force
#       difficult provisioning decisions and perhaps debt.
#     - During a later move, Ragho falls into a long wasting illness (-195 to -192);
#       Lomti carries the household load and his death sets up later decline.
#     phase: 'Midlife: caregiving, instability, and declining household fortune'
#   - age_range: 56-72
#     key_events:
#     - Lives as a widow; dependence shifts to relatives as her adult children die (-188
#       and -176), leaving her without direct support.
#     - Alcohol misuse becomes more entrenched; reputation suffers and she is treated
#       as burdensome or untrustworthy in some households.
#     - Dies of frailty/decline in a relative’s household (-169).

#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds wide social knowledge and contacts, but also draws attention
#       and rumors, which later magnify reputational damage.
#     scene: On market days and when caravans camp nearby, Lomti is the one who talks
#       first—haggling loudly, trading gossip, and hosting travelers with confident
#       familiarity.
#     timing: adolescence through midlife (ages 14-45)
#     trait: Extraversion (85th percentile)
#   - consequence: Contributes to household conflict, worsens outcomes during drought/pest
#       years, and makes her seem unreliable as a widow dependent.
#     scene: She postpones threshing/grain-storage tasks, improvises rations day-to-day,
#       and breaks agreed routines, leaving others to repair shortages or redo work.
#     timing: young adulthood onward (ages 18-60)
#     trait: Very low Conscientiousness (7th percentile)
#   - consequence: Weakens support from in-laws; increases likelihood she must move
#       between relatives’ households later.
#     scene: She argues sharply with co-wives/affinal kin and responds to criticism
#       with counter-accusations rather than apology, escalating domestic disputes.
#     timing: young adulthood through widowhood (ages 20-70)
#     trait: Low Agreeableness (19th percentile)
#   - consequence: Reinforces a reputation for being slippery/untrustworthy, deepening
#       marginalization after widowhood.
#     scene: She takes extra grain from shared stores 'for the children' and minimizes
#       it when confronted; she is also quick to flatter or mislead to secure small
#       favors.
#     timing: midlife to old age (ages 35-72)
#     trait: Low Honesty-Humility (11th percentile)
#   - consequence: Limits ability to manage accounts/credit cleanly; increases susceptibility
#       to being cheated in petty exchanges and to debt spirals.
#     scene: She struggles with remembering quantities and sequences in multi-step processing
#       (e.g., timing of soaking/fermenting or dividing stores), relying on others’
#       guidance and repeating simple rules.
#     timing: throughout life, most visible in early adulthood (ages 18-35)
#     trait: Low Intelligence (14th percentile)
#   - consequence: Increases accidents/illness risk, worsens household conflict, and
#       contributes to social disfavor and dependence in old age.
#     scene: What begins as drinking at festivals becomes frequent use after stressful
#       years; she hides small pots of fermented drink, drinks in the morning, and becomes
#       verbally aggressive or neglectful when intoxicated.
#     timing: onset late adolescence/early adulthood (ages 16-25), escalation after
#       husband’s illness and widowhood (ages 47-72)
#     trait: Substance-related disorder (alcohol/fermented drink misuse)
# number_of_children: '5'
# number_of_siblings: '9'
# occupation: Household manager/food processor (grain grinding, cooking, storage, water/fuel

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During one of her household moves, her husband developed a long wasting illness
#     with recurrent fever and cough; she nursed him at home, preparing thin gruels
#     and herbal decoctions and managing smoke-and-heat treatments while still keeping
#     the hearth and grain stores.
#   reasoning: High morbidity and limited formal care meant households relied on women
#     for prolonged nursing of fever, chronic infection, injury, or alcohol-related
#     illness in relatives.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 46–49
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: After her father could no longer travel with caravans due to failing sight
#     and weakness, she spent seasons in her natal hamlet helping her mother with grinding
#     grain, fetching water, and arranging care through kin while her father stayed
#     mostly indoors.
#   reasoning: As the eldest child in a large family and a household organizer, she
#     had a meaningful chance of caring for an aging parent or in-law, especially if
#     she remained near kin during part of adulthood.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 33–37
#   type: elderly_parents
# - event: While her husband was away on a regional trading circuit, she began a discreet
#     liaison with a caravan guard who lodged near their kin compound, meeting at night
#     by the cattle enclosure during the dry season.
#   reasoning: Mobility, possible marital strain, and later-life vulnerability (including
#     coercion) make at least one extramarital episode relatively plausible even if
#     concealed.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 28–30
#   type: extramarital_sex
# - event: One pregnancy ended in a late miscarriage with heavy bleeding and days of
#     fever; older women in the settlement treated her with warm compresses, massage,
#     and astringent plant preparations while she was kept from heavy work for several
#     weeks.
#   reasoning: In a high-mortality childbirth environment, miscarriage/stillbirth or
#     dangerous complications are common across multiple pregnancies; having 5 live
#     births implies additional pregnancies are possible.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 24–25
#   type: pregnancy_complications

Lomti was born in a small hamlet on the dry forest edge in what is now southeastern Rajasthan, where fields depended on the monsoon and the nearest market town was a day's walk with a load. The great Mauryan realm still mattered to the area through tax demands and the expectation that roads stay open, but the hamlets and caravan halts were run by local headmen and lineages. Lomti's family spoke a Munda tongue at home and an Indo‑Aryan vernacular in markets and with neighbors. At household shrines they offered grain and clarified butter to local guardians—stone spirits who watched the fields, ancestor figures who needed feeding—and they kept a small platform for the village's protective deity, where milk and grain went on market days and after safe returns from travel.

She was the first of ten children born to Buruŋ and Sāini. Buruŋ traveled with caravans when he could, moving grain, salt, and sometimes cattle. He returned with small coins and stories of tolls and quarrels at river crossings. Sāini kept the hearth and stores, and Lomti learned early to do what had to be done without waiting to be asked. She fetched water from the well while still small enough to brace the pot against her hip. By the time she could carry fuelwood, she had also learned how to sweep the grain room and tamp down the mud around the storage jars after rain.

Deaths came close together. When Lomti was two, the next baby boy died before his first season turned. Another brother lived longer, long enough to run messages and chase goats; he died when Lomti was eighteen, but his fevers and thinness had started years earlier. Between those two, a baby sister died at one year, and another younger brother died at nine. The household did the rites they knew: food set aside on a leaf, a smear of ash at the threshold, a night lamp protected from the wind. Lomti watched the older women press hands on bellies and foreheads, mutter names, and argue about which spirit had been offended.

As she grew into her teens, she pushed herself into talk that other girls stayed out of. When a trader’s wife complained about weights at market, Lomti leaned in, laughed, and told her how to test a stone weight in the palm. When her mother sent her with grain to barter, Lomti came home loud with news, repeating gossip about toll collectors and rumors from the road. She also drank. At festivals and after harvest she took cups of fermented grain beer from older cousins and did not stop at one. If someone tried to take the cup away, she slapped their hand and called them stingy.

By twelve she heard men speaking of Aśoka's death and of officials who no longer arrived on schedule. A local collector came demanding a levy and then did not return the next season. Strangers asked for "road money" and called it a toll. A headman's son started keeping a few armed youths near the paths. Lomti's father adjusted routes, sometimes taking longer paths to avoid known trouble spots.

At sixteen she was married to Ragho, a small trader tied to the same circuits as her father. She moved into Ragho’s settlement, not far enough to lose her language, but far enough that the wells tasted different and the people called the same grain by another name. Ragho’s kin lived nearby in clustered compounds, yet he and Lomti kept their own hearth. He came and went with the seasons, leaving her to run the house. She liked the control of it. She hated being corrected.

Their first child, a son, was born when she was seventeen and died the same day. She refused to stay inside afterward. She went out the next morning with a water pot as if it were any other day, and fought with Ragho’s aunt when the older woman told her to sit and be silent. Two years later a daughter was born and did not survive the night. The household responded with more offerings: a little mound of grain at the edge of the yard, a smear of butter at the stone where they left food for the village guardian. Lomti carried it out, muttering at the ants as if they were stealing from her.

When she was twenty‑four she conceived again. In the late months she felt the pains come early. Blood followed, heavy and frightening. She lay on a mat while Jomā, an older woman known for handling births, pressed warm cloths against her lower belly and ordered another woman to heat water again and again. Jomā rubbed her legs and belly with oil, fed her a bitter astringent brew, and warned her not to stand. Lomti obeyed for a few days and then tried to rise to stop a goat from breaking into the grain; Sāini’s sister shoved her back down and cursed her for stupidity. Fever followed, then eased. She stayed away from heavy work for weeks, resentful and restless.

At twenty‑eight she had a daughter who lived. Two years later a son lived. These two, and the grinding, cooking, and storage that kept them fed, made Lomti’s days full. She rose before dawn to start the fire, made thin gruel when stores were low, and kept better food for evenings when Ragho was home and wanted to feel he had returned to abundance. She took satisfaction in full jars sealed with mud and straw. She also gambled small amounts at festivals and laughed loudly when she won, even when it angered Ragho’s sister.

During a dry stretch when Lomti was twenty‑nine, Ragho left on a longer circuit. Grain prices rose; people brought coins to market more often, and debts began to be counted in small pieces of metal rather than promises. A caravan guard named Māto lodged near the kin compound for several nights. He spoke Lomti’s home language with an accent and joked about it, which made her laugh. One night, with the children asleep and the air hot even after dark, she met him by the cattle enclosure. She met him again. She kept it quiet, but quiet did not mean careful. A neighbor saw enough to talk, and Lomti responded the way she usually did: with insults and threats, not with denial. The talk clung to her.

When Lomti was thirty‑three she went back to her natal hamlet for a season. Her father Buruŋ could no longer travel; his eyes clouded and he stumbled on uneven ground. He sat inside during the bright part of the day, listening to the yard. Lomti fetched water for Sāini, ground grain until her shoulders ached, and arranged with her long‑lived brother Kiriŋ to bring extra fodder. She argued over it too—complaining that Kiriŋ brought the wrong amount, that he took too long, that he tried to look generous with someone else’s grain. Still, she came again the next season and the next, until Buruŋ stopped asking about the road.

In her forties the pressures of the frontier grew sharper. Banditry along routes rose and fell with the local politics, and some years the collector changed twice. Once, caterpillars stripped patches of crop. Another year the monsoon failed badly enough that wells sank low and goats grew thin. Ragho took risks to keep trading, chasing profit when others stayed home. Lomti managed what was left behind and drank more, small cups in the morning that she hid behind the grain jars.

At forty‑six, during a relocation meant to put them closer to a safer route, Ragho fell ill. The cough did not stop. Fever came in waves, and he grew thin while still sweating at night. Lomti set up a sleeping place near the hearth to keep him warm. She boiled thin gruels, added herbs given by an elder, and made smoke and heat treatments by covering him with cloth while hot stones hissed in water. She still had to grind grain, keep the jars sealed, and keep her children from wandering into other compounds. When she drank, she snapped at them and then forgot what she had promised. Ragho died when Lomti was forty‑eight. The move left them with fewer allies, and his death left her with debts.

Her surviving daughter grew into adulthood and married out. She died at thirty‑one, when Lomti was fifty‑three. Her son lasted longer, trading a little and farming when he had to, until he died at forty‑one, when Lomti was sixty‑five. By then Lomti had already shifted between relatives’ households more than once, moving after disputes, moving when stores ran out, moving when someone said she drank too much and brought trouble. Her sister Riniŋ took her in for a time; a nephew took her in later. Lomti did work when she could—sorting grain, tending the fire, pounding spices—but her hands shook some mornings and her temper made people avoid her.

In her last year she lived in a relative's compound, sleeping near the grain room so she could be watched. She ate little, complained about the food, and demanded beer. One morning she did not rise when the fire was lit. She died that day at seventy‑two, after weeks of sitting and eating less, her body failing without a single dramatic illness to name. They set food out for her spirit as they had set food out for all the others, and the household went on.
