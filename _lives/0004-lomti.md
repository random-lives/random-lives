# ethnicity: Munda-speaking (Austroasiatic) communities in the broader central Indian
#   hinterland
# father_occupation: Trader/caravan-related (periodic long-distance or regional trade
#   in grain, salt, livestock, forest products)
# historical_context:
# - event: Post-Aśokan political fragmentation and contestation (declining Mauryan cohesion
#     after c. 232 BCE), increasing local uncertainty—banditry/raiding risk, shifting
#     petty rulers, and irregular extraction on frontier villages and caravan routes.
#   timing: adolescence through midlife (c. ages 10–45)
# - event: Monsoon variability causing at least one serious multi-season drought or
#     rainfall failure in the region, leading to poor harvests, distress sales of grain/livestock,
#     and heightened food prices.
#   timing: anytime, but most likely midlife (c. ages 20–55)
# - event: Localized crop pest outbreaks (locusts/caterpillars) or plant disease affecting
#     dry-season stores and kharif crops, producing short but sharp subsistence stress
#     in rural households.
#   timing: intermittent across life (c. ages 5–65)
# - event: Expansion and normalization of money/markets under Mauryan-era economic integration
#     (greater use of coin, standardized weights, more regular market days), affecting
#     grain pricing, debt relationships, and small-scale trade opportunities.
#   timing: young adulthood to midlife (c. ages 15–50)

#     incident: sick_relative
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-9
#     key_events:
#     - Grows up in a patrilocal nuclear household near husband’s kin cluster; father
#       often absent on caravan circuits.
#     - Learns intensive household work early as more siblings arrive and several die
#       young.
#     - First exposures to market-day bustle and caravan talk through father’s network
#       (coins/weights as curiosities rather than literacy).
#     phase: Early childhood in natal hamlet (Kachra Kheri area)
#   - age_range: 10-17
#     key_events:
#     - Household anxiety increases with post-Aśokan unrest; rumors of tolls/raids on
#       routes and shifting local demands.
#     - Teen Lomti becomes outspoken and socially bold, helping negotiate with neighbors/kin
#       while mother works; starts tasting/using fermented drink at gatherings.
#     - Likely betrothal and marriage arrangements begin; preparation for moving to
#       husband’s settlement.
#     phase: Later childhood & adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-32
#     key_events:
#     - Marries Ragho (~-225) and relocates; begins life as household manager while
#       husband travels.
#     - Endures multiple pregnancies, including a late miscarriage and three infant
#       deaths, amid periodic crop stress and price swings.
#     - At least one relocation linked to trade opportunities/insecurity; household
#       ties to caravan lodging increase exposure to outsiders.

#   - age_range: 33-55
#     key_events:
#     - Returns seasonally to natal hamlet to care for aging father and assist mother
#       (-208 to -204).
#     - Political fragmentation and route insecurity peak; drought/pest years force
#       difficult provisioning decisions and perhaps debt.
#     - During a later move, Ragho falls into a long wasting illness (-195 to -192);
#       Lomti carries the household load and his death sets up later decline.
#     phase: 'Midlife: caregiving, instability, and declining household fortune'
#   - age_range: 56-72
#     key_events:
#     - Lives as a widow; dependence shifts to relatives as her adult children die (-188
#       and -176), leaving her without direct support.
#     - Alcohol misuse becomes more entrenched; reputation suffers and she is treated
#       as burdensome or untrustworthy in some households.
#     - Dies of frailty/decline in a relative’s household (-169).

#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds wide social knowledge and contacts, but also draws attention
#       and rumors, which later magnify reputational damage.
#     scene: On market days and when caravans camp nearby, Lomti is the one who talks
#       first—haggling loudly, trading gossip, and hosting travelers with confident
#       familiarity.
#     timing: adolescence through midlife (ages 14-45)
#     trait: Extraversion (85th percentile)
#   - consequence: Contributes to household conflict, worsens outcomes during drought/pest
#       years, and makes her seem unreliable as a widow dependent.
#     scene: She postpones threshing/grain-storage tasks, improvises rations day-to-day,
#       and breaks agreed routines, leaving others to repair shortages or redo work.
#     timing: young adulthood onward (ages 18-60)
#     trait: Very low Conscientiousness (7th percentile)
#   - consequence: Weakens support from in-laws; increases likelihood she must move
#       between relatives’ households later.
#     scene: She argues sharply with co-wives/affinal kin and responds to criticism
#       with counter-accusations rather than apology, escalating domestic disputes.
#     timing: young adulthood through widowhood (ages 20-70)
#     trait: Low Agreeableness (19th percentile)
#   - consequence: Reinforces a reputation for being slippery/untrustworthy, deepening
#       marginalization after widowhood.
#     scene: She takes extra grain from shared stores 'for the children' and minimizes
#       it when confronted; she is also quick to flatter or mislead to secure small
#       favors.
#     timing: midlife to old age (ages 35-72)
#     trait: Low Honesty-Humility (11th percentile)
#   - consequence: Limits ability to manage accounts/credit cleanly; increases susceptibility
#       to being cheated in petty exchanges and to debt spirals.
#     scene: She struggles with remembering quantities and sequences in multi-step processing
#       (e.g., timing of soaking/fermenting or dividing stores), relying on others’
#       guidance and repeating simple rules.
#     timing: throughout life, most visible in early adulthood (ages 18-35)
#     trait: Low Intelligence (14th percentile)
#   - consequence: Increases accidents/illness risk, worsens household conflict, and
#       contributes to social disfavor and dependence in old age.
#     scene: What begins as drinking at festivals becomes frequent use after stressful
#       years; she hides small pots of fermented drink, drinks in the morning, and becomes
#       verbally aggressive or neglectful when intoxicated.
#     timing: onset late adolescence/early adulthood (ages 16-25), escalation after
#       husband’s illness and widowhood (ages 47-72)
#     trait: Substance-related disorder (alcohol/fermented drink misuse)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During one of her household moves, her husband developed a long wasting illness
#     with recurrent fever and cough; she nursed him at home, preparing thin gruels
#     and herbal decoctions and managing smoke-and-heat treatments while still keeping
#     the hearth and grain stores.
#   reasoning: High morbidity and limited formal care meant households relied on women
#     for prolonged nursing of fever, chronic infection, injury, or alcohol-related
#     illness in relatives.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 46–49
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: After her father could no longer travel with caravans due to failing sight
#     and weakness, she spent seasons in her natal hamlet helping her mother with grinding
#     grain, fetching water, and arranging care through kin while her father stayed
#     mostly indoors.
#   reasoning: As the eldest child in a large family and a household organizer, she
#     had a meaningful chance of caring for an aging parent or in-law, especially if
#     she remained near kin during part of adulthood.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 33–37
#   type: elderly_parents
# - event: While her husband was away on a regional trading circuit, she began a discreet
#     liaison with a caravan guard who lodged near their kin compound, meeting at night
#     by the cattle enclosure during the dry season.
#   reasoning: Mobility, possible marital strain, and later-life vulnerability (including
#     coercion) make at least one extramarital episode relatively plausible even if
#     concealed.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 28–30
#   type: extramarital_sex
# - event: One pregnancy ended in a late miscarriage with heavy bleeding and days of
#     fever; older women in the settlement treated her with warm compresses, massage,
#     and astringent plant preparations while she was kept from heavy work for several
#     weeks.
#   reasoning: In a high-mortality childbirth environment, miscarriage/stillbirth or
#     dangerous complications are common across multiple pregnancies; having 5 live
#     births implies additional pregnancies are possible.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 24–25

Lomti was born in a small hamlet in the dry forest country of what is now southeast Rajasthan, where rainfed fields lay between scrub and tree cover and wells decided which households ate first in a bad season. Mauryan power reached the region through collectors, guards on roads, and local chiefs who answered to larger centers; the hamlets still ran on kin ties and bargains made at market days. Lomti’s family spoke a Munda tongue at home and an Indo‑Aryan village speech with neighbors and traders.

Her father, Buruŋ, traveled with caravans when she was small. He carried salt and small bundles of forest produce and returned with cloth, iron bits, and news of tolls and quarrels on the roads. Her mother, Sāini, ran the house: grinding, storing grain, keeping water jars filled, and putting children to sleep on hot nights. Lomti came first of ten. A younger brother followed and died the same year, then another brother who lived into his teens, then a sister who died at one. By the time Lomti was six, the courtyard had seen too many small burials, and she had learned to carry water without spilling it and to stop asking where the babies went.

She grew loud early. When women gathered at the well, Lomti cut into talk and pushed her way to the rope. When older girls teased her for it, she snapped back and kept her place. She liked the days her father returned. She sat close to the packs and picked at knots while men argued over weights and the feel of coins. She could not read marks, but she could tell which traders tried to short a measure by the way their hands moved.

In her later childhood, the world outside the hamlet pressed closer. After the death of Aśoka, the great court’s grip loosened. Men who carried letters and seals still came through, but the demands changed. One season it was a new toll, another season it was an extra claim on grain. Caravans started to travel with more guards. Lomti listened from the edge of men’s talk and repeated the sharp parts to her mother, adding her own insults.

She began drinking fermented grain beer at gatherings as a teenager. At first it was a cup passed around during songs. Then she kept asking for another. She laughed harder than others and talked over the singers. When Sāini pulled her away, Lomti shook her arm off and kept drinking until her head swam and she shouted at a cousin who tried to correct her.

At about seventeen, arrangements were made with a caravan-linked trader named Ragho, called Rāghava by people who wanted to sound careful. Lomti moved to his settlement, a place with a larger kin compound and more travelers stopping near the cattle pen. Ragho left often on circuits, sometimes gone for weeks. Lomti stayed and kept the hearth, stores, and day labor in order. She liked bargaining in the open. She liked the smell of fresh ground grain before dawn. She also left tasks half finished and blamed others when they failed. Grain jars stood unsealed. A tether wore through because she did not replace it when it frayed. A goat slipped loose and ruined a neighbor’s seedlings, and Lomti answered with a shout instead of an apology.

Her first child, a son, was born when she was seventeen or eighteen and died the same day. She washed him, wrapped him, and handed him over without tears, then quarreled with an older affinal aunt who suggested a spirit had been offended. Two years later a daughter was born and died within days. Lomti blamed the wet nurse for thin milk and threw a pot against the wall. The household’s older women kept their distance after that and took over parts of the childbed rituals without asking her.

At twenty-four, another pregnancy ended late. She bled heavily and shook with fever for days. Jomā, an older woman with a reputation for midwifery and plant remedies, pressed warm cloths to Lomti’s belly, rubbed her legs with oil, and gave her astringent preparations made from bark and leaves. Lomti survived, but she could not stand for long stretches for weeks. When she was finally back at the quern, she worked in angry bursts, then sat to drink and tell a neighbor’s girl to fetch water for her.

Two surviving children came in the next years: a daughter in her early twenties, then a son two years later. Lomti held them close and also used them in arguments, dragging them by the wrist to show others she was right. A later daughter was born when Lomti was about twenty-seven and died quickly, leaving Lomti with a hard, fixed temper in the house.

During those years markets grew busier and more regular. Coin and weights mattered more. Ragho began taking small loans and paying them with interest after a circuit went well. Lomti did not keep accounts. She forgot who had lent what and tried to repay with goods that did not match the agreement, then insisted the creditor was lying. Arguments flared at the edge of market stalls.

When Lomti was twenty-eight, Ragho left on a long circuit. A guard named Māto lodged near their kin compound with other men from the caravan. He joked with Lomti while she stirred a pot at dusk and asked for an extra ladle of gruel. Lomti met him later at night by the cattle enclosure during the dry season, when the yard lay quiet and the dogs slept. The meetings continued. She liked having someone who listened to her talk and did not correct her, and she liked the risk. When Ragho returned, she acted ordinary and dared anyone to challenge her.

In her mid-thirties, she returned in seasons to her natal hamlet. Buruŋ’s eyes had gone milky and he could not travel. He sat inside and felt for bowls by touch. Lomti fetched water with Sāini, arranged for a younger brother to stay nearby, and traded small quantities of grain for oil and herbs. She complained that her mother moved too slowly and that her father asked for more than he needed, then she sat beside him and fed him curds with her fingers. She stayed long enough each season for the chores, then left before the household could start ordering her around.

The rains failed in one run of years when Lomti was in her forties. Fields yielded thin heads of grain. People sold goats and borrowed against future harvest. Locusts came in another year and stripped patches of green in a day. Ragho changed routes and took more risks. The household moved at least twice, following kin offers and safer roads, carrying jars and bedding on carts and on heads.

During one of those moves, when Lomti was forty-six, Ragho developed a long illness with fever and a cough that did not stop. He sweated through nights and spat thick phlegm. Lomti nursed him in their new house, keeping smoke and heat around him, boiling thin gruels, and coaxing him to swallow bitter decoctions. She still ground grain, watched the stores, and argued with neighbors over borrowed pots. She also drank more. She hid a small jar behind the grain bins and took mouthfuls in the morning before anyone else rose. When she was drunk, she shouted at Ragho for being useless, then wiped his face and pulled the blanket up.

Ragho died when Lomti was around forty-eight. Without his circuits, the household’s money dried up. Debts that had been manageable became heavy. Her adult son worked and brought in grain, but he also quarreled with her. Her daughter married out and later returned only for short visits. Lomti’s drinking grew into a daily need, and relatives stopped trusting her with stores.

Her daughter died at thirty-one, when Lomti was in her fifties. Her son died at forty-one, when Lomti was sixty-five. Those deaths stripped away her remaining claim to a stable place. She moved between relatives’ compounds, first to a brother’s household, then to a sister’s kin network. She did work when pressed—grinding, sorting grain, cooking—but she stole small amounts for drink and lied about it. Some nights she fought with younger women, slapping and scratching. In the mornings she sat apart, chewing roasted grain and watching the courtyard.

At seventy-two, living in a relative’s house, Lomti stopped eating much. She sat by the wall, complained of weakness, and could not keep her balance when she stood. After several days of this decline, she died on a cool season night in the sleeping area near the hearth.
