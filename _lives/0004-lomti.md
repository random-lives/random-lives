# ethnicity: Munda-speaking (Austroasiatic) communities in the broader central Indian
#   hinterland
# father_occupation: Trader/caravan-related (periodic long-distance or regional trade
#   in grain, salt, livestock, forest products)
# historical_context:
# - event: Post-Aśokan political fragmentation and contestation (declining Mauryan cohesion
#     after c. 232 BCE), increasing local uncertainty—banditry/raiding risk, shifting
#     petty rulers, and irregular extraction on frontier villages and caravan routes.
#   timing: adolescence through midlife (c. ages 10–45)
# - event: Monsoon variability causing at least one serious multi-season drought or
#     rainfall failure in the region, leading to poor harvests, distress sales of grain/livestock,
#     and heightened food prices.
#   timing: anytime, but most likely midlife (c. ages 20–55)
# - event: Localized crop pest outbreaks (locusts/caterpillars) or plant disease affecting
#     dry-season stores and kharif crops, producing short but sharp subsistence stress
#     in rural households.
#   timing: intermittent across life (c. ages 5–65)
# - event: Expansion and normalization of money/markets under Mauryan-era economic integration
#     (greater use of coin, standardized weights, more regular market days), affecting
#     grain pricing, debt relationships, and small-scale trade opportunities.
#   timing: young adulthood to midlife (c. ages 15–50)

#     incident: sick_relative
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-9
#     key_events:
#     - Grows up in a patrilocal nuclear household near husband’s kin cluster; father
#       often absent on caravan circuits.
#     - Learns intensive household work early as more siblings arrive and several die
#       young.
#     - First exposures to market-day bustle and caravan talk through father’s network
#       (coins/weights as curiosities rather than literacy).
#     phase: Early childhood in natal hamlet (Kachra Kheri area)
#   - age_range: 10-17
#     key_events:
#     - Household anxiety increases with post-Aśokan unrest; rumors of tolls/raids on
#       routes and shifting local demands.
#     - Teen Lomti becomes outspoken and socially bold, helping negotiate with neighbors/kin
#       while mother works; starts tasting/using fermented drink at gatherings.
#     - Likely betrothal and marriage arrangements begin; preparation for moving to
#       husband’s settlement.
#     phase: Later childhood & adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-32
#     key_events:
#     - Marries Ragho (~-225) and relocates; begins life as household manager while
#       husband travels.
#     - Endures multiple pregnancies, including a late miscarriage and three infant
#       deaths, amid periodic crop stress and price swings.
#     - At least one relocation linked to trade opportunities/insecurity; household
#       ties to caravan lodging increase exposure to outsiders.
#     phase: 'Young adulthood: marriage, childbirth, and early moves'
#   - age_range: 33-55
#     key_events:
#     - Returns seasonally to natal hamlet to care for aging father and assist mother
#       (-208 to -204).
#     - Political fragmentation and route insecurity peak; drought/pest years force
#       difficult provisioning decisions and perhaps debt.
#     - During a later move, Ragho falls into a long wasting illness (-195 to -192);
#       Lomti carries the household load and his death sets up later decline.
#     phase: 'Midlife: caregiving, instability, and declining household fortune'
#   - age_range: 56-72
#     key_events:
#     - Lives as a widow; dependence shifts to relatives as her adult children die (-188
#       and -176), leaving her without direct support.
#     - Alcohol misuse becomes more entrenched; reputation suffers and she is treated
#       as burdensome or untrustworthy in some households.
#     - Dies of frailty/decline in a relative’s household (-169).

#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds wide social knowledge and contacts, but also draws attention
#       and rumors, which later magnify reputational damage.
#     scene: On market days and when caravans camp nearby, Lomti is the one who talks
#       first—haggling loudly, trading gossip, and hosting travelers with confident
#       familiarity.
#     timing: adolescence through midlife (ages 14-45)
#     trait: Extraversion (85th percentile)
#   - consequence: Contributes to household conflict, worsens outcomes during drought/pest
#       years, and makes her seem unreliable as a widow dependent.
#     scene: She postpones threshing/grain-storage tasks, improvises rations day-to-day,
#       and breaks agreed routines, leaving others to repair shortages or redo work.
#     timing: young adulthood onward (ages 18-60)
#     trait: Very low Conscientiousness (7th percentile)
#   - consequence: Weakens support from in-laws; increases likelihood she must move
#       between relatives’ households later.
#     scene: She argues sharply with co-wives/affinal kin and responds to criticism
#       with counter-accusations rather than apology, escalating domestic disputes.
#     timing: young adulthood through widowhood (ages 20-70)
#     trait: Low Agreeableness (19th percentile)
#   - consequence: Reinforces a reputation for being slippery/untrustworthy, deepening
#       marginalization after widowhood.
#     scene: She takes extra grain from shared stores 'for the children' and minimizes
#       it when confronted; she is also quick to flatter or mislead to secure small
#       favors.
#     timing: midlife to old age (ages 35-72)
#     trait: Low Honesty-Humility (11th percentile)
#   - consequence: Limits ability to manage accounts/credit cleanly; increases susceptibility
#       to being cheated in petty exchanges and to debt spirals.
#     scene: She struggles with remembering quantities and sequences in multi-step processing
#       (e.g., timing of soaking/fermenting or dividing stores), relying on others’
#       guidance and repeating simple rules.
#     timing: throughout life, most visible in early adulthood (ages 18-35)
#     trait: Low Intelligence (14th percentile)
#   - consequence: Increases accidents/illness risk, worsens household conflict, and
#       contributes to social disfavor and dependence in old age.
#     scene: What begins as drinking at festivals becomes frequent use after stressful
#       years; she hides small pots of fermented drink, drinks in the morning, and becomes
#       verbally aggressive or neglectful when intoxicated.
#     timing: onset late adolescence/early adulthood (ages 16-25), escalation after
#       husband’s illness and widowhood (ages 47-72)
#     trait: Substance-related disorder (alcohol/fermented drink misuse)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During one of her household moves, her husband developed a long wasting illness
#     with recurrent fever and cough; she nursed him at home, preparing thin gruels
#     and herbal decoctions and managing smoke-and-heat treatments while still keeping
#     the hearth and grain stores.
#   reasoning: High morbidity and limited formal care meant households relied on women
#     for prolonged nursing of fever, chronic infection, injury, or alcohol-related
#     illness in relatives.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 46–49
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: After her father could no longer travel with caravans due to failing sight
#     and weakness, she spent seasons in her natal hamlet helping her mother with grinding
#     grain, fetching water, and arranging care through kin while her father stayed
#     mostly indoors.
#   reasoning: As the eldest child in a large family and a household organizer, she
#     had a meaningful chance of caring for an aging parent or in-law, especially if
#     she remained near kin during part of adulthood.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 33–37
#   type: elderly_parents
# - event: While her husband was away on a regional trading circuit, she began a discreet
#     liaison with a caravan guard who lodged near their kin compound, meeting at night
#     by the cattle enclosure during the dry season.
#   reasoning: Mobility, possible marital strain, and later-life vulnerability (including
#     coercion) make at least one extramarital episode relatively plausible even if
#     concealed.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 28–30
#   type: extramarital_sex
# - event: One pregnancy ended in a late miscarriage with heavy bleeding and days of
#     fever; older women in the settlement treated her with warm compresses, massage,
#     and astringent plant preparations while she was kept from heavy work for several
#     weeks.
#   reasoning: In a high-mortality childbirth environment, miscarriage/stillbirth or
#     dangerous complications are common across multiple pregnancies; having 5 live
#     births implies additional pregnancies are possible.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 24–25

Lomti was born in a small hamlet on the dry-forest edge of what is now southeast Rajasthan, where rainfed fields broke up the scrub and cattle tracks ran toward market villages. Officials and tax collectors spoke for the Mauryan state far to the east, but in her area power sat close to the ground: headmen, armed retainers, and whoever controlled the safest stretches of road. At home Lomti heard Munda speech and the local Indo‑Aryan vernacular mixed together, and she grew up with household offerings that blended both worlds—rice gruel and flowers set at a smeared stone by the path, a pinch of grain cast into the cooking fire, and small libations poured at the base of a neem tree for village spirits.

She was the first child, and her mother, Sāini, handed her work early. Lomti learned to keep the hearth alive through winter mornings, to slap dung onto a wall for fuel, and to carry water from a shallow well with a rope that cut into her palms. Her father, Buruŋ, came and went with traders who moved salt, grain, ghee, and sometimes cattle. When he returned he brought stories and small things: a twist of salt wrapped in cloth, a copper coin to show off, a fragment of colored glass traded from someone farther west. Lomti could not read marks on anything, but she liked the clink of coin and the way men argued over weights.

The births came one after another. A brother arrived when she was two and died before the next hot season. Another brother lived long enough to run errands and taunt her in the yard; he died at fourteen after a fever that left him delirious, and his death changed how her mother watched the younger children. A sister died at one. Another brother died at nine. Lomti carried ash from the hearth to the small outdoor shrines after those deaths, pressing it onto stones and muttering names into the smoke. She also learned the blunt lesson that crying did not get the grain ground.

By the time Lomti was ten, people traveling the roads spoke more often of trouble. After Aśoka’s time, the chain of command frayed. A different set of men demanded grain, then another. Caravans started moving with extra guards. At night Lomti heard older men talk in the courtyard about tolls and raids. She listened closely and then repeated what she had heard the next day, enjoying the way attention gathered around her. She liked talk, liked an audience, liked the noise of a busy yard. Even when she was wrong about details, she argued anyway.

At sixteen she began drinking fermented millet beer at gatherings and festivals. It started with a cup pressed into her hand by an aunt during dancing, then a second cup because she laughed loudly and wanted more. When her mother scolded her, Lomti answered back and walked off to sit with girls her own age near the cattle line, swapping gossip and chewing roasted chickpeas.

Sāini arranged her marriage when Lomti was seventeen. The man was Ragho, a small trader tied to caravan circuits, older than her by several years and frequently away. Lomti moved to his settlement at eighteen and settled into a patrilocal household that stood close to his kin, but separate enough that she ran her own hearth. Ragho’s departures set the rhythm. When he was home he wanted food quickly and a full store jar. When he was gone the household leaned on her.

She became pregnant soon after marriage. Her first child, a boy, was born dead before dawn and carried away wrapped in cloth. Two years later a daughter died within days. Lomti argued with Ragho’s female relatives over blame—over what she had eaten, which spirit had been offended, which ancestor had been neglected. She did not lower her voice, even with elders present.

At twenty-four, during another pregnancy, she miscarried late. Blood soaked her bedding and she ran a fever. An older woman named Jomā, known for treating childbirth trouble, came with other women. They heated water and cloths, pressed warm compresses to Lomti’s belly, and rubbed her limbs with oil mixed with astringent plant paste. They made her drink bitter decoctions and kept her from the heavy quern stone for weeks. Lomti hated the forced stillness and broke it too early, standing to stir a pot and nearly fainting.

Markets in the region grew busier during her twenties. Coins circulated more widely and weights felt more standardized; even villages that once bartered by handfuls now talked in copper and measured out grain with more care. Ragho brought home small lumps of silver and a few stamped pieces, and he began extending credit to people he trusted. Lomti did not keep accounts well. She remembered faces and insults but forgot quantities. She scooped grain from jars to feed visitors and then denied she had taken so much when Ragho complained.

During a dry season when she was twenty-nine, Ragho went on a longer circuit. A caravan guard named Māto lodged near their kin compound. He had an easy grin and spoke both the local vernacular and enough of Lomti’s Munda speech to joke with her. Lomti met him at night by the cattle enclosure where the dung piles steamed faintly. It went on for weeks. She returned to her sleeping mat smelling of smoke and sweat, and in daylight she laughed more loudly than usual. When Ragho came home she treated him sharply, as if daring him to accuse her.

She carried two children to adulthood after that. A daughter was born when Lomti was twenty-two and lived into her thirties. A son came two years later and survived into his forties. Another daughter born when Lomti was twenty-seven died at birth. Between pregnancies she ran the household: grinding grain, fermenting beer, drying lentils, organizing water trips, and pushing younger girls to work faster. She enjoyed sitting in the late afternoon with a neighbor woman, Riniŋ, cracking jokes at passing boys and throwing husks at chickens. Lomti liked sour curd with salt and green chilies, and she took extra for herself before anyone else noticed.

When Lomti was thirty-five, she left Ragho’s settlement for a season and returned to her natal hamlet. Her father Buruŋ could no longer travel. His sight had dimmed and his legs shook when he stood. He sat inside the house in the heat, listening to others speak. Lomti hauled water, ground grain beside her mother, and arranged for kin to take turns sitting with Buruŋ when Sāini needed to go out. She argued with her long-lived younger brother Kiriŋ over whose turn it was to fetch fuel. Kiriŋ snapped back. Lomti shouted louder. In the end she did the work and kept score.

In midlife the monsoon failed hard one year. The kharif crop came up thin and brittle. People sold goats early and tried to stretch stored grain. Caterpillars stripped some fields the next season, and rumors of locusts farther away made everyone watch the sky. Ragho’s trading got riskier as banditry rose on some routes. A relocation followed when Lomti was in her mid-forties, pushed by a bad harvest and by shifting demands from local strongmen who claimed authority after the Mauryan grip weakened.

During that move Ragho fell into a long illness. He coughed through the nights and ran fevers that returned in waves. Lomti kept him on a mat near the hearth in cold months so smoke and heat warmed his chest. She made thin gruels, watered beer down, and boiled herbs into dark teas. She still had to manage storage jars, ration oil, and keep fuel piled. She drank more herself, stealing swallows from the fermenting pot in the morning. Some days she neglected the fire and the food burned. When relatives criticized her, she snapped and blamed them for withholding help.

Ragho died when Lomti was forty-eight. Debt remained. Without a husband and without a strong claim on land, she moved between relatives’ households, sometimes with Kiriŋ’s help, sometimes by clinging to her sister Riniŋ’s connections. Her surviving son kept her fed for a time, but he died when she was sixty-five. Her daughter, the one who had reached adulthood, died earlier, when Lomti was fifty-three. After that, Lomti became a dependent in other people’s compounds, valued for grinding and cooking when she was sober, scorned when she drank.

She reached seventy-two in a relative’s household, thin and unsteady, sleeping near the storeroom. One cool-season morning she could not rise from the mat. The household washed her, wrapped her in cloth, and carried her to a cremation spot outside the settlement. They burned her with firewood and cow dung cakes, and a niece placed a small offering of grain and curd at the edge of the ash.
