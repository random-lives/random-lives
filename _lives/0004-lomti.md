# ethnicity: Munda-speaking (Austroasiatic) communities in the broader central Indian
#   hinterland
# father_occupation: Trader/caravan-related (periodic long-distance or regional trade
#   in grain, salt, livestock, forest products)
# historical_context:
# - event: Post-Aśokan political fragmentation and contestation (declining Mauryan cohesion
#     after c. 232 BCE), increasing local uncertainty—banditry/raiding risk, shifting
#     petty rulers, and irregular extraction on frontier villages and caravan routes.
#   timing: adolescence through midlife (c. ages 10–45)
# - event: Monsoon variability causing at least one serious multi-season drought or
#     rainfall failure in the region, leading to poor harvests, distress sales of grain/livestock,
#     and heightened food prices.
#   timing: anytime, but most likely midlife (c. ages 20–55)
# - event: Localized crop pest outbreaks (locusts/caterpillars) or plant disease affecting
#     dry-season stores and kharif crops, producing short but sharp subsistence stress
#     in rural households.
#   timing: intermittent across life (c. ages 5–65)
# - event: Expansion and normalization of money/markets under Mauryan-era economic integration
#     (greater use of coin, standardized weights, more regular market days), affecting
#     grain pricing, debt relationships, and small-scale trade opportunities.

#     incident: sick_relative
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-9
#     key_events:
#     - Grows up in a patrilocal nuclear household near husband’s kin cluster; father
#       often absent on caravan circuits.
#     - Learns intensive household work early as more siblings arrive and several die
#       young.
#     - First exposures to market-day bustle and caravan talk through father’s network
#       (coins/weights as curiosities rather than literacy).
#     phase: Early childhood in natal hamlet (Kachra Kheri area)
#   - age_range: 10-17
#     key_events:
#     - Household anxiety increases with post-Aśokan unrest; rumors of tolls/raids on
#       routes and shifting local demands.
#     - Teen Lomti becomes outspoken and socially bold, helping negotiate with neighbors/kin
#       while mother works; starts tasting/using fermented drink at gatherings.
#     - Likely betrothal and marriage arrangements begin; preparation for moving to
#       husband’s settlement.
#     phase: Later childhood & adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-32
#     key_events:
#     - Marries Ragho (~-225) and relocates; begins life as household manager while
#       husband travels.
#     - Endures multiple pregnancies, including a late miscarriage and three infant
#       deaths, amid periodic crop stress and price swings.
#     - At least one relocation linked to trade opportunities/insecurity; household
#       ties to caravan lodging increase exposure to outsiders.

#   - age_range: 33-55
#     key_events:
#     - Returns seasonally to natal hamlet to care for aging father and assist mother
#       (-208 to -204).
#     - Political fragmentation and route insecurity peak; drought/pest years force
#       difficult provisioning decisions and perhaps debt.
#     - During a later move, Ragho falls into a long wasting illness (-195 to -192);
#       Lomti carries the household load and his death sets up later decline.
#     phase: 'Midlife: caregiving, instability, and declining household fortune'
#   - age_range: 56-72
#     key_events:
#     - Lives as a widow; dependence shifts to relatives as her adult children die (-188
#       and -176), leaving her without direct support.
#     - Alcohol misuse becomes more entrenched; reputation suffers and she is treated
#       as burdensome or untrustworthy in some households.
#     - Dies of frailty/decline in a relative’s household (-169).

#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds wide social knowledge and contacts, but also draws attention
#       and rumors, which later magnify reputational damage.
#     scene: On market days and when caravans camp nearby, Lomti is the one who talks
#       first—haggling loudly, trading gossip, and hosting travelers with confident
#       familiarity.
#     timing: adolescence through midlife (ages 14-45)
#     trait: Extraversion (85th percentile)
#   - consequence: Contributes to household conflict, worsens outcomes during drought/pest
#       years, and makes her seem unreliable as a widow dependent.
#     scene: She postpones threshing/grain-storage tasks, improvises rations day-to-day,
#       and breaks agreed routines, leaving others to repair shortages or redo work.
#     timing: young adulthood onward (ages 18-60)
#     trait: Very low Conscientiousness (7th percentile)
#   - consequence: Weakens support from in-laws; increases likelihood she must move
#       between relatives’ households later.
#     scene: She argues sharply with co-wives/affinal kin and responds to criticism
#       with counter-accusations rather than apology, escalating domestic disputes.
#     timing: young adulthood through widowhood (ages 20-70)
#     trait: Low Agreeableness (19th percentile)
#   - consequence: Reinforces a reputation for being slippery/untrustworthy, deepening
#       marginalization after widowhood.
#     scene: She takes extra grain from shared stores 'for the children' and minimizes
#       it when confronted; she is also quick to flatter or mislead to secure small
#       favors.
#     timing: midlife to old age (ages 35-72)
#     trait: Low Honesty-Humility (11th percentile)
#   - consequence: Limits ability to manage accounts/credit cleanly; increases susceptibility
#       to being cheated in petty exchanges and to debt spirals.
#     scene: She struggles with remembering quantities and sequences in multi-step processing
#       (e.g., timing of soaking/fermenting or dividing stores), relying on others’
#       guidance and repeating simple rules.
#     timing: throughout life, most visible in early adulthood (ages 18-35)
#     trait: Low Intelligence (14th percentile)
#   - consequence: Increases accidents/illness risk, worsens household conflict, and
#       contributes to social disfavor and dependence in old age.
#     scene: What begins as drinking at festivals becomes frequent use after stressful
#       years; she hides small pots of fermented drink, drinks in the morning, and becomes
#       verbally aggressive or neglectful when intoxicated.
#     timing: onset late adolescence/early adulthood (ages 16-25), escalation after
#       husband’s illness and widowhood (ages 47-72)
#     trait: Substance-related disorder (alcohol/fermented drink misuse)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During one of her household moves, her husband developed a long wasting illness
#     with recurrent fever and cough; she nursed him at home, preparing thin gruels
#     and herbal decoctions and managing smoke-and-heat treatments while still keeping
#     the hearth and grain stores.
#   reasoning: High morbidity and limited formal care meant households relied on women
#     for prolonged nursing of fever, chronic infection, injury, or alcohol-related
#     illness in relatives.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 46–49
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: After her father could no longer travel with caravans due to failing sight
#     and weakness, she spent seasons in her natal hamlet helping her mother with grinding
#     grain, fetching water, and arranging care through kin while her father stayed
#     mostly indoors.
#   reasoning: As the eldest child in a large family and a household organizer, she
#     had a meaningful chance of caring for an aging parent or in-law, especially if
#     she remained near kin during part of adulthood.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 33–37
#   type: elderly_parents
# - event: While her husband was away on a regional trading circuit, she began a discreet
#     liaison with a caravan guard who lodged near their kin compound, meeting at night
#     by the cattle enclosure during the dry season.
#   reasoning: Mobility, possible marital strain, and later-life vulnerability (including
#     coercion) make at least one extramarital episode relatively plausible even if
#     concealed.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 28–30
#   type: extramarital_sex
# - event: One pregnancy ended in a late miscarriage with heavy bleeding and days of
#     fever; older women in the settlement treated her with warm compresses, massage,
#     and astringent plant preparations while she was kept from heavy work for several
#     weeks.
#   reasoning: In a high-mortality childbirth environment, miscarriage/stillbirth or
#     dangerous complications are common across multiple pregnancies; having 5 live
#     births implies additional pregnancies are possible.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 24–25

Lomti was born in a small hamlet in the dry forests of what is now southeastern Rajasthan, where cropped plots lay close to grazing and scrub. Her people spoke a Munda tongue at home and used an Indo‑Aryan village speech when dealing with neighbors and traders. When she was small, officials tied to the Mauryan realm still mattered in the wider region—road guards, toll points, and demands for grain or labor—though her hamlet answered first to local headmen and the strength of kin.

Her father, Buruŋ, left often with caravans that moved salt, grain, and livestock between market towns. He returned with stories about road blocks and which stretches were safe, and with small things that caught children’s attention: a copper coin, a stamped weight, a strip of dyed cloth. Lomti learned early that her mother, Sāini, kept the household steady while the men moved. She carried water with other girls, gathered fuel, and learned to judge grain by touch. She had nine younger siblings in all. Two died so early that the household spoke of them only in ritual phrases, and one brother reached fourteen before a fever took him. When Lomti was nine, another brother died at nine. The losses kept coming close enough together that she stopped expecting the younger ones to reach adulthood.

She grew into a tall, loud girl who pushed herself into conversations. At gatherings she sat close to older women and interrupted them, demanding details about births, remedies, and what signs meant in a child’s cough. When someone told her to fetch water, she argued about whose turn it was. The adults still sent her, and she returned later than expected, talking on the path. At seasonal festivals she drank the lightly sour brew that women kept for guests. By sixteen she drank more than the others. She laughed hard, sang loudly, and then snapped at anyone who teased her about it.

Her marriage was arranged when she was seventeen. The next year she moved to her husband’s settlement, not far in distance but far enough that the fields and wells were new. Her husband, Ragho, ran small trade through the caravan circuits. He bought and sold grain when prices moved, carried bundles of salt and cloth, and hired himself out to bigger merchants when the roads were quiet. He was away for weeks at a time. Lomti managed the hearth and the stores, ground grain, watched the pots, and kept the children of the compound out of the drying grain. She understood her authority through the work. If the hearth ran well, she spoke as if she owned the whole courtyard.

At eighteen she gave birth to a son. The baby died the same day. Two years later a daughter was born and died as well. The deaths brought older women to her doorstep with advice and blame. Lomti answered them sharply. She insisted the problem was bad water and dirty hands, not spirits. Then she paid for offerings anyway, pushing a small plate of grain and ghee toward the village guardian stone because she could not stop the pressure from the courtyard.

When she was twenty‑four, she became pregnant again. Late in that pregnancy, after a day of heavy work at the grinding stone and carrying water, pain started low in her belly. Bleeding followed. Jomā, an older woman who handled births and herbs, came quickly. They warmed cloths near the fire, pressed them to Lomti’s belly, and rubbed her legs and back. Jomā boiled a bitter astringent drink and made Lomti swallow it. The bleeding went on through the night. Fever came after. For days Lomti lay on a mat while the household moved around her, and her sister‑in‑law grumbled at the extra work. When the fever broke, Lomti sat up and demanded food. Within weeks she returned to the grinding stone, complaining about aches and refusing to rest when others told her to.

At twenty‑seven she had a daughter who lived. Two years later, she bore a son who lived too. By then the world outside the hamlet felt less settled. The Mauryan order that elders spoke about with certainty fractured after Aśoka’s death. New demands appeared without warning. A messenger would arrive asking for grain, then another promising protection from raiders if the village sent men to help guard a track. Ragho changed routes and delayed travel, and some seasons he took work closer to home. Money circulated more often. Market sellers expected small coins for salt or oil. Lomti handled coins in her palm and hated counting them. She lost track and accused sellers of cheating her, sometimes correctly, sometimes not. After one argument she threw a coin into the dust and walked away, leaving Ragho to clean up the quarrel on his return.

When Lomti was twenty‑nine, Ragho left on a circuit that took him beyond the nearer markets. A caravan guard named Māto lodged near the kin compound for several nights, sleeping with other men by the cattle enclosure. Lomti saw him while bringing water at dusk and later while handing out a bowl of gruel to travelers. He spoke her home language badly and the village speech well. He listened to her complaints about prices and the way her in‑laws watched her. On a dry-season night she met him behind the cattle pen. That became a pattern for several weeks. She returned to her mat with dust on her feet and a sharper edge to her temper. When Ragho came back, she demanded gifts and spoke about the road as if she knew it. Rumors moved through women’s talk. Sāini heard them later and scolded Lomti in private, and Lomti laughed and told her mother to mind her own hearth.

When Lomti was thirty‑three, word came that Buruŋ could no longer travel. His eyesight failed and he stumbled in the courtyard. Lomti went back to her natal hamlet for part of each year for four seasons. She brought her surviving children with her at first, then left them with Ragho and traveled alone. She fetched water, pounded grain, and took over the household when Sāini’s hands shook with fatigue. Buruŋ sat indoors, rubbing his eyes and asking for news from the road. Lomti arranged help through her younger brothers and cousins, sometimes by shouting until they agreed. She also carried fermented drink in a small pot and drank while working, telling herself it calmed her. It made her clumsy. Once she cut her hand badly on a sickle while sharpening it and had to keep it wrapped for days while still directing others.

In her forties, rainfall failed across two seasons. The fields produced thin stalks. Locusts stripped patches that had survived the first dry spell. Grain prices rose in the markets, and Ragho took loans against future sales. Lomti hid small amounts of grain in a pot under rags, then denied it when confronted. The household moved again when she was forty‑six, chasing a better position near a safer route. During that move Ragho started coughing. Fever came and went. The cough stayed. He sweated at night and lost weight until his hip bones stood out. Lomti kept him propped by the fire, fed him thin gruels, and made herbal decoctions that Jomā’s sister taught her to prepare. She heated stones, wrapped them, and placed them near his chest. She smoked his bedding over the hearth to drive out whatever she believed clung to cloth. She also kept the grain stores in order and forced her children to work harder. Ragho lived three more years and died when Lomti was forty‑nine.

Widowhood changed her standing at once. She argued with Ragho’s kin about what remained of his goods. Some debt followed her. She drank more openly. Her daughter, the one born when Lomti was twenty‑seven, married out. Her son stayed near her for a time, but his own household needs came first. When Lomti was fifty‑three, she lost another infant daughter soon after birth. After that she stopped speaking of more children and poured herself into food work, then into drink.

Her adult daughter died at thirty‑one, when Lomti was fifty‑eight. Her son died at forty‑one, when Lomti was sixty‑five. With her children gone, she moved between relatives. Her long‑lived sister Riniŋ took her in for stretches, then a brother’s household did. Lomti still pushed herself into talk at market days, still laughed loudly, still picked fights over small slights. She also took grain without asking and blamed children for it. Relatives fed her because she was kin and because she could still grind and stir pots when she chose.

At seventy‑two, after a cold-season spell of poor appetite and days spent sitting close to the fire, she stopped getting up. A niece brought her thin porridge and water. Lomti died on a mat in her relatives’ house in the dry forest zone where she had ended up after her last move.
