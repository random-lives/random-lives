# ethnicity: Munda-speaking (Austroasiatic) communities in the broader central Indian
#   hinterland
# father_occupation: Trader/caravan-related (periodic long-distance or regional trade
#   in grain, salt, livestock, forest products)
# historical_context:
# - event: Post-Aśokan political fragmentation and contestation (declining Mauryan cohesion
#     after c. 232 BCE), increasing local uncertainty—banditry/raiding risk, shifting
#     petty rulers, and irregular extraction on frontier villages and caravan routes.
#   timing: adolescence through midlife (c. ages 10–45)
# - event: Monsoon variability causing at least one serious multi-season drought or
#     rainfall failure in the region, leading to poor harvests, distress sales of grain/livestock,
#     and heightened food prices.
#   timing: anytime, but most likely midlife (c. ages 20–55)
# - event: Localized crop pest outbreaks (locusts/caterpillars) or plant disease affecting
#     dry-season stores and kharif crops, producing short but sharp subsistence stress
#     in rural households.
#   timing: intermittent across life (c. ages 5–65)
# - event: Expansion and normalization of money/markets under Mauryan-era economic integration
#     (greater use of coin, standardized weights, more regular market days), affecting
#     grain pricing, debt relationships, and small-scale trade opportunities.
#   timing: young adulthood to midlife (c. ages 15–50)

#     incident: sick_relative
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-9
#     key_events:
#     - Grows up in a patrilocal nuclear household near husband’s kin cluster; father
#       often absent on caravan circuits.
#     - Learns intensive household work early as more siblings arrive and several die
#       young.
#     - First exposures to market-day bustle and caravan talk through father’s network
#       (coins/weights as curiosities rather than literacy).
#     phase: Early childhood in natal hamlet (Kachra Kheri area)
#   - age_range: 10-17
#     key_events:
#     - Household anxiety increases with post-Aśokan unrest; rumors of tolls/raids on
#       routes and shifting local demands.
#     - Teen Lomti becomes outspoken and socially bold, helping negotiate with neighbors/kin
#       while mother works; starts tasting/using fermented drink at gatherings.
#     - Likely betrothal and marriage arrangements begin; preparation for moving to
#       husband’s settlement.
#     phase: Later childhood & adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-32
#     key_events:
#     - Marries Ragho (~-225) and relocates; begins life as household manager while
#       husband travels.
#     - Endures multiple pregnancies, including a late miscarriage and three infant
#       deaths, amid periodic crop stress and price swings.
#     - At least one relocation linked to trade opportunities/insecurity; household
#       ties to caravan lodging increase exposure to outsiders.
#     phase: 'Young adulthood: marriage, childbirth, and early moves'
#   - age_range: 33-55
#     key_events:
#     - Returns seasonally to natal hamlet to care for aging father and assist mother
#       (-208 to -204).
#     - Political fragmentation and route insecurity peak; drought/pest years force
#       difficult provisioning decisions and perhaps debt.
#     - During a later move, Ragho falls into a long wasting illness (-195 to -192);
#       Lomti carries the household load and his death sets up later decline.
#     phase: 'Midlife: caregiving, instability, and declining household fortune'
#   - age_range: 56-72
#     key_events:
#     - Lives as a widow; dependence shifts to relatives as her adult children die (-188
#       and -176), leaving her without direct support.
#     - Alcohol misuse becomes more entrenched; reputation suffers and she is treated
#       as burdensome or untrustworthy in some households.
#     - Dies of frailty/decline in a relative’s household (-169).

#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds wide social knowledge and contacts, but also draws attention
#       and rumors, which later magnify reputational damage.
#     scene: On market days and when caravans camp nearby, Lomti is the one who talks
#       first—haggling loudly, trading gossip, and hosting travelers with confident
#       familiarity.
#     timing: adolescence through midlife (ages 14-45)
#     trait: Extraversion (85th percentile)
#   - consequence: Contributes to household conflict, worsens outcomes during drought/pest
#       years, and makes her seem unreliable as a widow dependent.
#     scene: She postpones threshing/grain-storage tasks, improvises rations day-to-day,
#       and breaks agreed routines, leaving others to repair shortages or redo work.
#     timing: young adulthood onward (ages 18-60)
#     trait: Very low Conscientiousness (7th percentile)
#   - consequence: Weakens support from in-laws; increases likelihood she must move
#       between relatives’ households later.
#     scene: She argues sharply with co-wives/affinal kin and responds to criticism
#       with counter-accusations rather than apology, escalating domestic disputes.
#     timing: young adulthood through widowhood (ages 20-70)
#     trait: Low Agreeableness (19th percentile)
#   - consequence: Reinforces a reputation for being slippery/untrustworthy, deepening
#       marginalization after widowhood.
#     scene: She takes extra grain from shared stores 'for the children' and minimizes
#       it when confronted; she is also quick to flatter or mislead to secure small
#       favors.
#     timing: midlife to old age (ages 35-72)
#     trait: Low Honesty-Humility (11th percentile)
#   - consequence: Limits ability to manage accounts/credit cleanly; increases susceptibility
#       to being cheated in petty exchanges and to debt spirals.
#     scene: She struggles with remembering quantities and sequences in multi-step processing
#       (e.g., timing of soaking/fermenting or dividing stores), relying on others’
#       guidance and repeating simple rules.
#     timing: throughout life, most visible in early adulthood (ages 18-35)
#     trait: Low Intelligence (14th percentile)
#   - consequence: Increases accidents/illness risk, worsens household conflict, and
#       contributes to social disfavor and dependence in old age.
#     scene: What begins as drinking at festivals becomes frequent use after stressful
#       years; she hides small pots of fermented drink, drinks in the morning, and becomes
#       verbally aggressive or neglectful when intoxicated.
#     timing: onset late adolescence/early adulthood (ages 16-25), escalation after
#       husband’s illness and widowhood (ages 47-72)
#     trait: Substance-related disorder (alcohol/fermented drink misuse)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During one of her household moves, her husband developed a long wasting illness
#     with recurrent fever and cough; she nursed him at home, preparing thin gruels
#     and herbal decoctions and managing smoke-and-heat treatments while still keeping
#     the hearth and grain stores.
#   reasoning: High morbidity and limited formal care meant households relied on women
#     for prolonged nursing of fever, chronic infection, injury, or alcohol-related
#     illness in relatives.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 46–49
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: After her father could no longer travel with caravans due to failing sight
#     and weakness, she spent seasons in her natal hamlet helping her mother with grinding
#     grain, fetching water, and arranging care through kin while her father stayed
#     mostly indoors.
#   reasoning: As the eldest child in a large family and a household organizer, she
#     had a meaningful chance of caring for an aging parent or in-law, especially if
#     she remained near kin during part of adulthood.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 33–37
#   type: elderly_parents
# - event: While her husband was away on a regional trading circuit, she began a discreet
#     liaison with a caravan guard who lodged near their kin compound, meeting at night
#     by the cattle enclosure during the dry season.
#   reasoning: Mobility, possible marital strain, and later-life vulnerability (including
#     coercion) make at least one extramarital episode relatively plausible even if
#     concealed.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 28–30
#   type: extramarital_sex
# - event: One pregnancy ended in a late miscarriage with heavy bleeding and days of
#     fever; older women in the settlement treated her with warm compresses, massage,
#     and astringent plant preparations while she was kept from heavy work for several
#     weeks.
#   reasoning: In a high-mortality childbirth environment, miscarriage/stillbirth or
#     dangerous complications are common across multiple pregnancies; having 5 live
#     births implies additional pregnancies are possible.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 24–25

Lomti was born in a small hamlet on the dry-forest edge of what is now southeast Rajasthan, where rainfed fields and grazing patches lay between scrub and open woodland. The Mauryan state reached into the region through taxes, tolls, and road-watchers on the routes that fed Malwa’s markets, and later through uncertainty as that control broke apart. Lomti’s family spoke a Munda tongue at home and used an Indo‑Aryan village speech in markets and dealings with outsiders.

She arrived as the first child in a household that stood above most of its neighbors. Her father, Buruŋ, traveled with caravans when the season allowed, carrying grain, salt, and animals between villages and larger market places. Her mother, Sāini, ran the hearth and stores, and taught Lomti early to keep a lid on a pot, to judge the weight of a grinding stone, to sense when a clay jar was dry enough for grain. The hamlet lived close to Buruŋ’s kin cluster, but Lomti’s parents kept their own fire and their own bins.

Children followed quickly. When Lomti was two, her first younger brother died in the same year he was born. At four, another brother arrived; he lived long enough to run errands and mock Lomti’s serious face, then died at fourteen. A sister died at one. Another brother, born when Lomti was eight, survived into old age. Between those births came a boy who died at nine, and then four more siblings who reached adulthood: three sisters and a brother. The house filled and emptied, and Sāini kept the daily round steady—grain, water, fuel, dung, cooking, storage—while Lomti learned to do it without being asked.

She became the child who stepped forward in crowded places. On market days she pressed close to the sellers, listened to the talk of prices, and called out to people she recognized from her father’s stories. She enjoyed roasted gram and sour curd, and she liked to sit at the edge of the threshing floor when the work was done, watching dust settle and men argue over measures. She also left things undone. She forgot to cover jars. She let a pot boil down too far. When Sāini scolded her, Lomti snapped back and then acted as if the scolding had never happened.

By the time Lomti was ten, the talk around the route had changed. Men spoke of guards demanding extra payment, of petty chiefs taking tolls, of officials with different seals. Travelers arrived with new coins and insisted on new weights. Buruŋ brought home copper pieces and showed them off, tapping them on the floor. Lomti could not follow the counting, but she watched who handled the coins and how quickly they disappeared into cloth folds.

At sixteen she began drinking the fermented grain drink served at gatherings after harvest. It made her louder, quicker to laugh, quicker to accuse. Sāini tried to keep it from her, but Lomti knew where the jars were stored and took sips in the morning while she swept the yard.

She married at about sixteen. Her husband, Ragho, kept one foot in village farming and the other on the route, carrying goods in small lots and traveling with other men for safety. Lomti moved to his settlement and took charge of a new hearth. Ragho’s kin lived close enough that women drifted in and out of the yard, commenting on her hands, her pace, her temper. She answered them sharply.

Her first child, a son, was born when she was seventeen and died the same day. Two years later a daughter was born and also died at birth. The older women pressed her belly, rubbed her back, and spoke of spirits and hot and cold foods. Lomti did what they told her, then ignored their rules when she felt like it.

At twenty-four, she carried another pregnancy into late months and then lost it. The bleeding started at night and continued into morning. She lay on a mat while Jomā, an older woman with a reputation for strong hands, worked over her—warm compresses, massage, astringent plant mixtures, smoke at the doorway. Lomti survived, weak and angry. For weeks she did not lift heavy loads. When she returned to work, she pushed herself too fast, then missed days and left grain to sit damp.

She had two children who lived: a daughter born when she was twenty-two, and a son born at twenty-four. They grew into noisy, active children. Lomti kept them close, shouted at them, then gave them extra food when she felt generous. At twenty-seven she bore another daughter who died at birth.

During her late twenties the route brought strangers to the edge of her kin compound—guards, drovers, men looking for a night’s shelter. Ragho left on longer circuits. In the dry season when she was twenty‑eight, she began meeting one of the guards, Māto, after dark by the cattle enclosure. He came smelling of dust and sweat and sometimes of meat from the road. She chose the nights, told him where to stand, and sent him away when she heard footsteps. When Ragho returned she acted as she always had. The risk lay in other eyes, not in Ragho’s.

At thirty-three she moved again, this time back toward her natal hamlet for seasons at a stretch. Buruŋ could no longer travel. His sight failed, and his legs shook when he stood. Lomti fetched water and ground grain beside Sāini, arranging which sibling would bring fuel, who would sit with their father while the rest worked. Her younger brother Kiriŋ argued with her about stores; she accused him of holding back grain. Sāini cut in and told them to stop. Lomti stopped in the moment and resumed the argument the next day.

The years from her teens through midlife brought stretches of hard weather. A run of weak monsoons left the fields thin. Once, during her forties, insects took stored grain and damaged the next sowing. Ragho borrowed to cover a shortfall, then spent a season chasing better prices at a market farther west. Lomti dealt with traders at the gate, spoke too fast, and accepted deals she did not understand. More than once she found out after the fact that she had traded away more grain than she meant to.

When she was forty-six, she and Ragho moved again, following a safer route and a place where Ragho expected better trade. On that move he began coughing. It turned into a long illness—fever, cough, nights of sweating, days when he could not sit up. Lomti kept the household running while nursing him. She cooked thin gruels, boiled water with herbs, and held him near the hearth so he could breathe the warm smoky air. She slept little. She also drank more, starting early in the day, hiding a small pot behind stacked fuel. When Ragho’s kin came to advise, she told them to leave. When they returned anyway, she fought them over grain and blamed them for not bringing enough.

Ragho died when Lomti was forty‑nine. Without his earnings she sold animals and used up stored grain. Her surviving son reached adulthood and tried to steady the household, but Lomti quarreled with his wife and took from shared stores. Her daughter, grown and married, died at thirty‑one when Lomti was fifty‑three. Her son died at forty‑one when Lomti was sixty‑five. After that she had no children to anchor her place.

She moved between relatives’ compounds. Her sister Riniŋ took her in for a time, then sent her to a brother’s household when disputes grew too loud. Lomti still rose before dawn to light the fire, grind grain, and manage water and fuel, but she left tasks half done and snapped at younger women. She drank whenever she could, sometimes stumbling in the yard, sometimes starting arguments that ended with her being pushed outside the gate until she quieted.

In her seventy-second year she lived in a relative’s household, sleeping near the cooking area where she could be watched. She stopped eating full meals and could not finish her chores. One morning she sat by the storage jars and did not rise when called. She died there, in the compound, with the day’s work beginning around her.
