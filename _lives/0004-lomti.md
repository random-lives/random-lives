# ethnicity: Munda-speaking (Austroasiatic) communities in the broader central Indian
#   hinterland
# father_occupation: Trader/caravan-related (periodic long-distance or regional trade
#   in grain, salt, livestock, forest products)
# historical_context:
# - event: Post-Aśokan political fragmentation and contestation (declining Mauryan cohesion
#     after c. 232 BCE), increasing local uncertainty—banditry/raiding risk, shifting
#     petty rulers, and irregular extraction on frontier villages and caravan routes.
#   timing: adolescence through midlife (c. ages 10–45)
# - event: Monsoon variability causing at least one serious multi-season drought or
#     rainfall failure in the region, leading to poor harvests, distress sales of grain/livestock,
#     and heightened food prices.
#   timing: anytime, but most likely midlife (c. ages 20–55)
# - event: Localized crop pest outbreaks (locusts/caterpillars) or plant disease affecting
#     dry-season stores and kharif crops, producing short but sharp subsistence stress
#     in rural households.
#   timing: intermittent across life (c. ages 5–65)
# - event: Expansion and normalization of money/markets under Mauryan-era economic integration
#     (greater use of coin, standardized weights, more regular market days), affecting
#     grain pricing, debt relationships, and small-scale trade opportunities.
#   timing: young adulthood to midlife (c. ages 15–50)

#     incident: sick_relative
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-9
#     key_events:
#     - Grows up in a patrilocal nuclear household near husband’s kin cluster; father
#       often absent on caravan circuits.
#     - Learns intensive household work early as more siblings arrive and several die
#       young.
#     - First exposures to market-day bustle and caravan talk through father’s network
#       (coins/weights as curiosities rather than literacy).
#     phase: Early childhood in natal hamlet (Kachra Kheri area)
#   - age_range: 10-17
#     key_events:
#     - Household anxiety increases with post-Aśokan unrest; rumors of tolls/raids on
#       routes and shifting local demands.
#     - Teen Lomti becomes outspoken and socially bold, helping negotiate with neighbors/kin
#       while mother works; starts tasting/using fermented drink at gatherings.
#     - Likely betrothal and marriage arrangements begin; preparation for moving to
#       husband’s settlement.
#     phase: Later childhood & adolescence
#   - age_range: 18-32
#     key_events:
#     - Marries Ragho (~-225) and relocates; begins life as household manager while
#       husband travels.
#     - Endures multiple pregnancies, including a late miscarriage and three infant
#       deaths, amid periodic crop stress and price swings.
#     - At least one relocation linked to trade opportunities/insecurity; household
#       ties to caravan lodging increase exposure to outsiders.
#     phase: 'Young adulthood: marriage, childbirth, and early moves'
#   - age_range: 33-55
#     key_events:
#     - Returns seasonally to natal hamlet to care for aging father and assist mother
#       (-208 to -204).
#     - Political fragmentation and route insecurity peak; drought/pest years force
#       difficult provisioning decisions and perhaps debt.
#     - During a later move, Ragho falls into a long wasting illness (-195 to -192);
#       Lomti carries the household load and his death sets up later decline.
#     phase: 'Midlife: caregiving, instability, and declining household fortune'
#   - age_range: 56-72
#     key_events:
#     - Lives as a widow; dependence shifts to relatives as her adult children die (-188
#       and -176), leaving her without direct support.
#     - Alcohol misuse becomes more entrenched; reputation suffers and she is treated
#       as burdensome or untrustworthy in some households.
#     - Dies of frailty/decline in a relative’s household (-169).

#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Builds wide social knowledge and contacts, but also draws attention
#       and rumors, which later magnify reputational damage.
#     scene: On market days and when caravans camp nearby, Lomti is the one who talks
#       first—haggling loudly, trading gossip, and hosting travelers with confident
#       familiarity.
#     timing: adolescence through midlife (ages 14-45)
#     trait: Extraversion (85th percentile)
#   - consequence: Contributes to household conflict, worsens outcomes during drought/pest
#       years, and makes her seem unreliable as a widow dependent.
#     scene: She postpones threshing/grain-storage tasks, improvises rations day-to-day,
#       and breaks agreed routines, leaving others to repair shortages or redo work.
#     timing: young adulthood onward (ages 18-60)
#     trait: Very low Conscientiousness (7th percentile)
#   - consequence: Weakens support from in-laws; increases likelihood she must move
#       between relatives’ households later.
#     scene: She argues sharply with co-wives/affinal kin and responds to criticism
#       with counter-accusations rather than apology, escalating domestic disputes.
#     timing: young adulthood through widowhood (ages 20-70)
#     trait: Low Agreeableness (19th percentile)
#   - consequence: Reinforces a reputation for being slippery/untrustworthy, deepening
#       marginalization after widowhood.
#     scene: She takes extra grain from shared stores 'for the children' and minimizes
#       it when confronted; she is also quick to flatter or mislead to secure small
#       favors.
#     timing: midlife to old age (ages 35-72)
#     trait: Low Honesty-Humility (11th percentile)
#   - consequence: Limits ability to manage accounts/credit cleanly; increases susceptibility
#       to being cheated in petty exchanges and to debt spirals.
#     scene: She struggles with remembering quantities and sequences in multi-step processing
#       (e.g., timing of soaking/fermenting or dividing stores), relying on others’
#       guidance and repeating simple rules.
#     timing: throughout life, most visible in early adulthood (ages 18-35)
#     trait: Low Intelligence (14th percentile)
#   - consequence: Increases accidents/illness risk, worsens household conflict, and
#       contributes to social disfavor and dependence in old age.
#     scene: What begins as drinking at festivals becomes frequent use after stressful
#       years; she hides small pots of fermented drink, drinks in the morning, and becomes
#       verbally aggressive or neglectful when intoxicated.
#     timing: onset late adolescence/early adulthood (ages 16-25), escalation after
#       husband’s illness and widowhood (ages 47-72)
#     trait: Substance-related disorder (alcohol/fermented drink misuse)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During one of her household moves, her husband developed a long wasting illness
#     with recurrent fever and cough; she nursed him at home, preparing thin gruels
#     and herbal decoctions and managing smoke-and-heat treatments while still keeping
#     the hearth and grain stores.
#   reasoning: High morbidity and limited formal care meant households relied on women
#     for prolonged nursing of fever, chronic infection, injury, or alcohol-related
#     illness in relatives.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 46–49
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: After her father could no longer travel with caravans due to failing sight
#     and weakness, she spent seasons in her natal hamlet helping her mother with grinding
#     grain, fetching water, and arranging care through kin while her father stayed
#     mostly indoors.
#   reasoning: As the eldest child in a large family and a household organizer, she
#     had a meaningful chance of caring for an aging parent or in-law, especially if
#     she remained near kin during part of adulthood.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 33–37
#   type: elderly_parents
# - event: While her husband was away on a regional trading circuit, she began a discreet
#     liaison with a caravan guard who lodged near their kin compound, meeting at night
#     by the cattle enclosure during the dry season.
#   reasoning: Mobility, possible marital strain, and later-life vulnerability (including
#     coercion) make at least one extramarital episode relatively plausible even if
#     concealed.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 28–30
#   type: extramarital_sex
# - event: One pregnancy ended in a late miscarriage with heavy bleeding and days of
#     fever; older women in the settlement treated her with warm compresses, massage,
#     and astringent plant preparations while she was kept from heavy work for several
#     weeks.
#   reasoning: In a high-mortality childbirth environment, miscarriage/stillbirth or
#     dangerous complications are common across multiple pregnancies; having 5 live
#     births implies additional pregnancies are possible.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 24–25
#   type: pregnancy_complications

Lomti was born in a small hamlet on the dry-forest edge of what is now southeast Rajasthan, where fields depended on the monsoon and cattle grazed the scrub between thorn trees. The district lay within the reach of the Mauryan world to the east, but authority arrived in pieces: a tax collector passing through, a demand for grain, a guard at a crossing, then months of silence. Lomti’s family spoke a Munda tongue at home and used an Indo-Aryan village speech in markets and with outsiders.

Her father, Buruŋ, traveled in trading parties. He carried salt, grain, and sometimes livestock, and he brought back small copper pieces and stories about the road. Lomti grew up with her mother, Sāini, keeping the house and yard running near the father’s kin. The household was not hungry most years. There were good pots, a spare sickle, and enough cattle dung to dry into neat fuel cakes stacked by the wall.

Children arrived quickly after Lomti. A brother came when she was two and died before he could be given more than a cradle name. Another brother, born when she was four, lived long enough to run with her to the edge of the fields, then died at fourteen after a sudden fever that left him confused and hot for days. A sister followed and died at one year old. Two more brothers and four more sisters came after that. Lomti learned to carry water early, to keep little ones from the cooking fire, and to hush a crying baby when Sāini’s hands were full of wet grain. She liked the noise of workdays when neighbors came to pound grain together and talk. She copied their teasing and made sharper jokes than the older girls liked.

By the time she was ten, travelers brought different talk. The old certainty of one distant power faded after the great emperor’s death. Men argued about who controlled which road. Some seasons a petty chief’s men demanded a toll at a ford; another season they vanished and a different set appeared. Buruŋ began to travel with more guards. Lomti listened at the doorway when he spoke with other men at night, then repeated the parts that made the women laugh: which official had fallen from his horse, whose donkey had bolted with sacks of salt.

In her teens she started drinking fermented grain beer at festivals and after hard days, first in cups passed around, then from small clay pots she hid behind the fuel stack. She talked too much when she drank. She made promises she forgot the next morning. When Sāini scolded her for leaving millet out to spoil, Lomti shouted back and did not lower her voice even when elders were present.

At sixteen she was betrothed to Ragho, a caravan-linked trader from another settlement in the same broad region. She moved to his kin cluster at eighteen, into a small house close to his relatives. Ragho left before dawn for circuits that took him toward the bigger market towns. Lomti stayed. She rose early to grind grain, boiled porridge thick enough to stand a spoon in it, and kept jars sealed against damp. She liked to sit in the late afternoon at the cattle enclosure when the animals came home, trading gossip with other women and laughing at the insults men threw at each other as they tied their ropes.

Her first child, a son, was born when she was seventeen turning eighteen. He died the same day, and the women washed him and carried him out without ceremony beyond a few murmured offerings. Two years later a daughter was born and died before her hair was thick enough to tie. Lomti did not speak softly about it. She blamed Ragho’s mother for giving her bad food, and she argued until Ragho’s older brother stepped between them.

When Lomti was twenty-four she became pregnant again. The pregnancy ended late, with heavy bleeding that soaked the cloths Sāini’s daughter-in-law brought from a neighbor’s house. Lomti lay on a mat while the older woman Jomā pressed warm compresses to her belly and rubbed her lower back with oil. They gave her bitter astringent preparations and kept her from lifting water jars. Fever came and went for days. She recovered and returned to work with anger at the time she had lost, snapping at anyone who moved her pots or touched her grain stores.

A surviving daughter arrived when Lomti was twenty-two turning twenty-three, and a son two years after that. With children who lived, Lomti became harder to manage. She insisted on deciding how much grain to put aside and how much to sell, and she accused Ragho’s kin of taking from her jars. Ragho brought home coins and weighed them in his palm, and Lomti watched without understanding the numbers involved, then demanded he spend some of it on salt or cloth she wanted. She enjoyed the taste of fresh curds with a pinch of salt and would eat more than her share, then deny it when the pot was found scraped.

At twenty-nine, while Ragho was away on a longer circuit, a caravan guard named Māto lodged near the compound with other men. Lomti talked with him openly in daylight, leaning against the cattle pen as if it were nothing. When the dry season nights turned cool, she met him behind the enclosure where the smell of dung covered other scents. It lasted until Ragho returned. Lomti did not confess. She watched for any sign that someone had seen and answered questions with quick anger.

When she was thirty-three, Buruŋ stopped traveling. His sight failed and he walked slowly, hands out before him in the yard, feeling for walls. Lomti returned to her natal hamlet for whole seasons between planting and harvest. She ground grain for Sāini and fetched water from the well, swearing at younger cousins who left the rope tangled. She arranged for a nephew to sit with Buruŋ when Sāini had to go to the fields. She brought a small amount of salt and a few copper pieces, then complained loudly that her brothers should give more. One brother, Kiriŋ, argued with her in front of others. She answered with insults that made the women snort with laughter and made Kiriŋ leave the courtyard in a rage.

As she entered her forties, the road became less predictable. Guards demanded payment more often. Ragho shifted routes, sometimes staying longer away, sometimes returning quickly after hearing of trouble ahead. A year of poor rains hit when Lomti was in her early forties. Grain prices rose. Ragho sold a goat to cover a debt, and Lomti accused him of selling too cheaply. That year locusts stripped leaves from a patch of beans and the women pulled the pests off by hand, dropping them into fires.

At forty-six, during a household move to a settlement closer to a more reliable market, Ragho started coughing. He had fevers that came in waves and left him sweating, then cold. Lomti nursed him for years. She cooked thin gruels and pressed him to drink. She burned damp leaves and made him inhale smoke and heat under a cloth, because that was what the local healer advised. She still managed the hearth, the stores, and the children. She drank more, hiding a pot in the back corner and taking swallows before dawn. When Ragho’s cough worsened, she snapped at neighbors who came with advice and threw one woman out of the house for touching the sick man’s bedding.

Ragho died when Lomti was forty-eight. Without his road connections, the household lost credit. Her son reached adulthood and worked, but he died at forty-one, leaving Lomti past sixty without his support. Her adult daughter died at thirty-one. Lomti moved between relatives’ households, staying where she was tolerated. She took more food than she was given and denied it. She argued with her sister Riniŋ, then tried to make up by singing drinking songs and offering to grind grain, only to abandon the stone midway and wander off to talk with men at the edge of the market.

In her seventies she lived in a relative’s house, sleeping near the storage jars. She could still pound grain, though slowly, and she watched the pots to keep others from taking. She spent more mornings with a cup in her hand than with the grinding stone. One cold-season week she stopped eating properly, lay down for much of the day, and did not recover. She died at seventy-two in that house, after several days of not rising from her mat.
