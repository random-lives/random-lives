Shlomit was born on March 25, 366 BC in a low desert basin west of the head of the Persian Gulf, where Achaemenid officials collected tribute from the towns along the waterways and left the grazing lands to tribal custom. Her family spoke Imperial Aramaic at home and dealt with neighbors through kin ties and seasonal agreements over wells and pasture.

Her father, Bar-Malku, owned sheep and goats and moved them between sparse grazing and water points. He had two wives. Shlomit’s mother, Atarah, shared a tent line with the other wife, Naqia. The women milked at dawn, strained the foam through cloth, and set skins of souring milk in the shade. They kneaded flour when it could be bought from traders and cooked thin breads on a hot stone. At night they poured a little milk on the sand at the edge of the camp and spoke names of household gods and older powers, asking for protection from sickness.

Shlomit was the second child. Her older sister, Hannah, survived into adulthood. After Shlomit came seven more births. Two babies were buried within days. One boy died at two years. Another child lived two seasons and then died in the cold months.

Shlomit never fed strongly. Atarah kept her wrapped close while she worked, tried goat’s milk when her own failed, and rubbed salt and fat on the child’s gums. Shlomit’s belly stayed swollen and her limbs stayed thin. On June 6, 365 BC, Atarah set her down on a folded cloak inside the tent and Shlomit died there before nightfall.
