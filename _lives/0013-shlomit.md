Shlomit was born on March 25, 366 BC in a camp of Aramaic-speaking pastoralists west of the head of the Persian Gulf, where Achaemenid officials collected tribute and expected safe passage along the routes that linked the Gulf to Babylon. Her father, Nadan, kept sheep and goats and a few camels and moved his household between wells and sparse grazing. He had two wives. Shlomit’s mother, Atarah, shared the work with the other wife, Rahmah: milking at first light, straining the milk into skin bags, churning butter by rocking a bag hung from a pole, and boiling sour milk into thicker curds that traveled well.

Shlomit was the second child. Her older sister, Tamar, was a toddler who already carried kindling and watched younger children when the women worked. The household grew crowded as more babies came. Some lived only a season. At night the women set a small dish of grain and a little poured milk at the edge of the sleeping space and spoke short prayers to the powers that guarded the family and herd.

Shlomit did not take milk well. Atarah tried goat milk thinned with water, then more curds and broth as the months passed. Shlomit stayed small and soft-limbed, and she tired quickly. On June 6, 365 BC, after a day of wind and dust, she lay quiet on a folded wool blanket while the camp prepared the evening meal. Atarah washed her, wrapped her, and the family buried her in the sand beyond the tethered animals, marking the place with stones.
