Mariam was born at the end of March in 1779 in the low wet country near the bends of the river in the Malda tract. Their homestead sat on a raised patch in a shared compound: her father’s household and his brothers’ households facing the same yard. There were cooking fires, a few trees, and walls of mud and thatch that did not keep voices in.

The men worked rented plots on share. Rent was not a season to them but a constant. An agent came with a paper and a seal and sat on a stool as if he owned the shade. Mariam could not read what was written, but she learned how the older men’s faces changed when the paper came out. They spoke softly, then argued after the man left, then went quiet again.

Her father left for days at a time to find extra work when the grain from their plots would not cover what was demanded. When he was gone, the women ran the place. Mariam’s mother earned small money by pounding rice for others, spinning thread, and shaping dung cakes to dry. Mariam was put to it early. She did not drift from task to task. She did one thing until it was done, then looked for the next.

She was the second child. Five children were born to her mother. Two boys died as infants, one after the other, and their names were still used when someone spoke of bad luck. Her mother watched Mariam’s younger sister too closely, touching her forehead for heat, counting her breaths at night. When sickness moved through the village, her mother tied a thread at the child’s wrist and went to the nearby shrine with a small offering.

They were Muslims and kept the basic rites, but the shrine mattered in the same way the well and the market mattered. People went there for relief when they had no other handle on things. Mariam went with her mother on crowded days. She did not join the singing. She stood close, shoulders tight, eyes scanning faces. She listened for what people said about whose vow had been answered and who had been refused.

By eleven she did more than a child’s share. She husked grain until her hands blistered and her shoulders knotted. She watched smaller cousins when the older women went to seek work or bargain for a better rate. She kept track of small tools and bundles and noticed when something was missing. If someone took more than their portion, she said so to their face. She did not smile to soften it.

She did not trust people easily and she did not hide it. If an aunt told her to go on an errand after dark, Mariam said no and stayed where she was. If the aunt raised her voice, Mariam raised her eyes and stared until the aunt cursed and turned away. Her mother told her she would make enemies for nothing. Mariam answered that enemies were already there.

Some monsoon seasons the water sat too long in the low fields. Work stopped for days. Grain stores dampened and turned sour at the edges. In those years the household ate thinner rice and more greens. Mariam’s mother took on more pounding. Mariam spun more thread, twisting it hard, and carried small lots to a better-off house where women bought it for weaving. She counted what she brought and counted what she was paid, and she watched hands.

More soldiers and their followers moved through the area in those years, using the roads and the river routes. They bought grain when they had coin and took it when they did not. They hired porters. They crowded the markets and the ferries. They brought noise, new rumors, and sickness that passed from mouth to mouth in the tea stalls and from sleeping mats in the rest-houses.

The quarrel that stuck to Mariam started over thread when she was thirteen. A servant in the weaving household grabbed at Mariam’s bundle and said the skeins were mixed with rough fiber. Mariam called her a liar and said her mistress paid for scraps and wanted the price of good work. Other women came in from the yard, drawn by the sound. The servant reached again. Mariam yanked the bundle back and a skein fell into the dust. The servant shouted that Mariam had been light with the weight and heavy with excuses.

Mariam did not back down. She shouted that she would not be cheated, that she knew the servant’s tricks, that she saw where the coins went. An older neighbor slapped Mariam across the face, not to defend the servant but to stop the scene. Mariam turned her head back and kept talking. After that, some women stopped calling her for small jobs. Work shifted to other yards. Her mother found other piecework and stopped speaking much at home. If Mariam complained, her mother told her to keep her mouth shut and her hands moving.

In her fourteenth year the household became steadier. Her father’s absences were regular now, tied to seasons of work elsewhere, and he returned with small coins instead of only promises. The brothers held their tenancy. There was more rice in the pot. Mariam did not change with it. She slept in short stretches and woke before anyone else, sitting near the cold ashes with her shawl tight around her shoulders. She finished chores without being told and then sat empty-handed, staring at the yard as if waiting for someone to step wrong.

She startled easily. If someone laughed behind her, she jerked and looked as if she had been struck. She accused her sister of stealing scraps of food when the girl had only eaten what was left in the pot. She watched her mother’s hands when her mother handled money. When her mother spoke about finding her a match, Mariam’s face went blank and hard. She walked out and did not return until the talk was over.

In early January of 1795 the nights were cold enough to bite through the thatch and thin walls. Mariam began coughing. Within days it deepened and would not settle. She tried to keep working, bending over the husking pot until she had to stop to breathe. Her mother warmed oil and rubbed her chest. She took Mariam to the shrine and made a vow with a small offering, then brought her home before the crowd could press in on her.

Fever came and stayed. Mariam lay on a reed mat by the fire. Sweat soaked her hair and then she shivered hard enough to rattle the mat. Her breathing grew loud and rough in the hours before dawn, each breath taking longer than the last. On January 14, still fifteen years old, she stopped breathing. The fire burned down. The winter air moved through the gaps in the wall and the yard outside remained stiff with cold.
