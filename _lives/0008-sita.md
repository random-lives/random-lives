Sita was born on 19 August 1936 in a village outside Raebareli, on the flat cropland of the Gangetic plain. In the hot months the work shifted early and late, and at noon people stayed in the shade. Her parents spoke Awadhi at home.

Shanti, her mother, began most mornings by rinsing her hands, lighting a small oil lamp in the wall niche, and setting down water and a few flower petals before the images. Then she put rice on the fire.

They lived as a nuclear household. Sita was the fourth child. Two older sisters had already died, one as a baby and one at two years old. The three surviving children were an older brother and two sisters. The brother was taken along to the fields when he could be useful. One girl carried water. The other kept an eye on the baby while Shanti swept the courtyard and shaped dung cakes to dry for fuel.

Ram Saran farmed his own small plots and kept buffalo. Before daylight he cut fodder and checked the animals. He milked them and carried the milk in a brass pot to the market. The cash from milk came in small amounts and often, and he used it for salt, oil, and medicine when someone fell sick.

In late January 1937, fog sat over the fields in the mornings and Sita started to cough. Within days her breathing turned fast and wet. Shanti kept her on her lap close to the warmth of the chulha and rubbed warmed oil on her chest. Ram Saran went into town and returned with a packet of medicine powder from a shop. It did not turn the illness.

On 7 February 1937, before midday, Sita’s breathing slowed and stopped.
