historical_notes:
  - "Camila’s birth date (15 Jan 2021) places her in Mexico’s high-mortality COVID-19 period; Mexico recorded roughly 334,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths cumulatively by 2023, consistent with continued masking/temperature checks in early 2021 clinics and workplaces."
  - "Coahuila (including the Monclova–Frontera area) is part of northern Mexico’s export-manufacturing belt linked to U.S. supply chains; maquiladora/IMMEX-style assembly expanded after NAFTA (1994), providing a plausible local labor context for Maribel’s low-wage, shift-based packaging work and periodic hour cuts."
  - "National poverty levels were high around Camila’s infancy: CONEVAL reported about 43.9% of Mexico’s population in poverty in 2020 (~55.7 million people). This macro context supports the narrative’s “formal job but still food/phone-credit insecurity,” without claiming it is unique to Coahuila."
  - "Camila’s demographic profile aligns with the region’s mainstream pattern: Coahuila is predominantly Spanish-speaking, and many urban/peri-urban households identify as mestizo and use Spanish in daily life; a Spanish-only home/school environment is therefore consistent with local norms rather than indicating linguistic isolation."
  - "The household’s Catholicism is expressed through widely documented Mexican popular devotion (Virgen de Guadalupe imagery, votive candles, posadas), which commonly persists even when weekly Mass attendance is irregular—matching the story’s pay-day candle and occasional Sunday Mass."

Camila Moreno García was born on January 15, 2021, in La Cruz outside Frontera, Coahuila, when masks and temperature checks were still normal. Maribel Moreno García delivered her in a public clinic and brought her back to the rented room where she slept with her two daughters. Camila’s father did not come. He never became someone the girls waited for.

Spanish filled the room, quick and sharp when Maribel got home from the maquiladora. She worked shifts packing parts under fluorescent lights. When the factory cut hours, there were days of beans and tortillas and nothing else, and the phone stopped working because there was no credit. When shifts came back, Camila’s older sister, Sofi, handled what Maribel could not: warming tortillas on the comal, keeping Camila from wandering into the street, walking her to the corner in the morning and watching her go with the other kids.

Camila fixated on small systems. She took apart a broken fan and set the screws in a straight line on the floor, separated by size. She sorted bottle caps by color and blocked Sofi’s hand when Sofi tried to sweep them into a pile. If someone changed the order, Camila argued until her voice went thin and harsh. She asked the same question again and again, not waiting for the answer to land, until Maribel snapped at her to stop. After that Camila went silent and stared, tracking Maribel’s face instead of the words.

In first grade she lost things constantly. She left her notebook at school twice in one week and came home insisting she had done the work. She forgot the reading sheet, then showed up the next day with the wrong paper folded into her pocket. When the teacher sent notes home, Maribel read them at the small table after a night shift, still in her work shirt, her hair tied back. She told Camila to open her backpack. Camila pulled at the zipper slowly, then dumped everything out—wrinkled worksheets, a broken pencil, candy wrappers—and pushed the pile away when Maribel asked where the missing pages were. Maribel raised her voice; Camila stared at the table and did not move.

Above the bed, a printed Virgen de Guadalupe sat in a cheap plastic frame. In the corner, Maribel kept a glass candle and lit it on paydays, the flame steady until the wax ran down the side. Some Sundays she took the girls to Mass if she was not coming off a night shift. In December they joined a neighbor’s posada. Camila stayed tight against Sofi’s arm, mouthed the parts she remembered, and went quiet when it was time to greet people.

By 2027 Camila had learned not to speak to strangers unless she was forced. After school she sat on the step outside their door and ran a pebble back and forth across the same spot on the concrete until it left a pale line of dust. When she heard her mother’s key, she stood up immediately, shoulders tight, eyes fixed on the lock, ready to answer for whatever she had forgotten that day.
