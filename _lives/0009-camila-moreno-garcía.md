historical_notes:
  - "In northern Mexico, the “maquiladora” system—factories tied to export supply chains that expanded along the U.S. border after trade liberalization—has long provided steady but low-wage shift work, often with tight production demands and limited job security for workers."
  - "In 2020–2022, COVID-19 public-health measures and economic disruptions in Mexico affected school routines, childcare arrangements, and household income, with many families experiencing reduced hours, interruptions, or informal work as a fallback."
  - "Coahuila’s desert-edge towns include many households that mix formal wages with informal survival strategies (sharing housing, relying on neighbors or older siblings for care, stretching food budgets), reflecting longstanding regional inequality and uneven access to services."
  - "“Culturally Catholic” practice in much of Mexico often centers on home devotions (images of the Virgen de Guadalupe, candles, prayers) and community celebrations like posadas, alongside key rites such as baptism and first communion even when regular Mass attendance is occasional."

Camila Moreno García was born on January 15, 2021, in La Cruz outside Frontera, Coahuila. The pandemic was still in place. Her mother, Maribel Moreno García, gave birth alone. Camila’s father did not come to the rented room where Maribel and the two girls slept, and he never became a person the girls expected to see.

Spanish filled the room, fast and clipped when Maribel came back from the maquiladora. She worked shifts packing parts under fluorescent lights. When the factory cut hours, there was less food and the phone credit ran out. When the shifts returned, Camila’s older sister, Sofi, took over the small jobs at home: heating tortillas, keeping Camila inside, walking her to the corner when it was time for school.

Camila noticed things other people passed over. She pulled apart a broken fan and left the screws in a neat row on the floor. She lined bottle caps by color and argued when Sofi mixed them. She asked the same question again and again until Maribel snapped at her to stop. Then Camila stopped talking and watched.

In first grade she lost track of her own work. She left her notebook in the classroom twice in one week. She forgot to bring home the reading sheet and said she had done it anyway. Her teacher sent notes. Maribel read them at the kitchen table after a night shift, still in her work shirt, rubbing her forehead. She told Camila to open her backpack and show what she had. Camila stared at the zipper, moved slowly, and then pushed the papers away when Maribel asked where the missing pages were.

A small printed Virgen de Guadalupe hung above the bed in a plastic frame. On paydays Maribel lit a candle. On Sunday mornings she sometimes took the girls to Mass if she was not asleep from the night shift. In December they went to a neighbor’s posada; Camila stayed close to Sofi and sang the parts she knew.

By 2027 Camila had learned to be quiet with strangers. After school she sat on the step outside their door and turned a pebble between her fingers. When she heard her mother’s key, she stood up at once, as if she had been waiting for hours even when it had only been minutes.
