#     death_year: -355
#     name: Nari
#     narrative_role: Only live-born child; dies shortly after birth. His loss hardens
#       Suri’s fear of sudden illness and deepens her sense that she must watch everything
#       all the time.
#     sex: M
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 19
#     connection: Occurs soon after marriage and relocation; fever and heavy bleeding

#     incident: elderly_parents
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-7
#     key_events:
#     - Born very short and treated as physically vulnerable; older women keep her close
#       during work and rituals.
#     - Older brother Bori dies at age 7 (Suri age ~2), shaping household anxieties
#       and protective practices.
#     - Learns water-carrying, fuel gathering, and herd-watching in small tasks; begins
#       showing bold curiosity and talkativeness.
#     phase: Early childhood in mother’s kin compound (birth to ~7)
#   - age_range: 8-17
#     key_events:
#     - Becomes highly social at wells/market days; asks outsiders questions about distant
#       places and goods (high openness/extraversion).
#     - Recurring fear episodes during night sounds/raiding rumors; develops hypervigilant
#       habits (sleep light, checks animals).

#     name: Dika
#     narrative_role: A successful herder for much of adulthood; proud and status-conscious.
#       His help is conditional, and tensions with Suri flare when resources tighten.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Gains practical ideas and wider contacts, but also draws suspicion
#       for being 'too curious' and for talking beyond her station.
#     scene: At seasonal market days she lingers with caravan-linked visitors, handling
#       beads/cloth and pressing them for stories of salt sources, far water, and new
#       iron shapes; she experiments with new storage and cooking methods learned from
#       travelers.
#     timing: later childhood through early adulthood (ages ~12–30)
#     trait: Openness (very high)
#   - consequence: Builds a strong presence and allies, but escalates conflicts and
#       makes reconciliation harder after arguments.
#     scene: She takes the lead in work songs, organizes other women to move together
#       to distant water, and speaks loudly in disputes rather than yielding.
#     timing: adolescence through middle adulthood (ages ~14–45)
#     trait: Extraversion (very high)
#   - consequence: Reputation for being difficult; contributes to marital breakdown
#       and to conditional/strained kin support later.
#     scene: When accused of taking extra milk or grain, she responds with sharp counter-accusations
#       and refuses to perform conciliatory gestures until forced by elders; she often
#       interprets ambiguous acts as disrespect.
#     timing: adolescence onward; peaks during separation and poverty (ages ~16–56)
#     trait: Agreeableness (very low)
#   - consequence: Occasional short-term advantage, but worsens trust and increases
#       monitoring by co-residents.
#     scene: She withholds information about small household stores and bargains hard
#       at exchange, sometimes exaggerating need or downplaying what she has to secure
#       better terms.
#     timing: most visible during economic stress (ages ~30–56)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (low)
#   - consequence: Strained sleep and irritability; increases conflict but also makes
#       her effective at noticing danger and preventing some losses.
#     scene: At night she startles at animal movement or distant shouting, checks the
#       enclosure repeatedly, and has breath-catching episodes during storms or illness
#       in the household; she rehearses escape routes and keeps tools close.
#     timing: begins after early family deaths/raiding rumors (ages ~6–12) and intensifies
#       after pregnancy loss and separation (ages ~19–56)
#     trait: Neuroticism (high) + Anxiety-related disorder (chronic anxiety/hypervigilance)
#   - consequence: Social slights contribute to her combative style; also reduces her
#       leverage in physical confrontations, making verbal dominance more central.
#     scene: She is assigned tasks that fit her size (sorting grain, small-stock handling)
#       and is mocked in disputes; she compensates by being loud, assertive, and refusing
#       to be physically pushed aside.
#     timing: childhood through adulthood (ages ~5–40 especially)
#     trait: Height (very short, 3rd percentile)
# number_of_children: '1'
# number_of_siblings: '5'
# occupation: Agro-pastoral household producer (farming/gardening + tending small stock/dairy
#   + food processing and provisioning work)
# religion: Local ancestral + household/hearth offerings; protective and fertility rites
#   tied to kin, cattle, and seasons (community elders/ritual specialists)

# - event: 'Sustained period: After her separation, she spent several seasons living
#     in a relative’s compound and took on much of the daily care for an aging parent—bringing
#     water and firewood, preparing porridge and milk, and helping them move when joints
#     and weakness made walking difficult, especially during the hottest months.'
#   reasoning: Some parents survived into old age, and daughters often provided hands-on
#     support, but her migration at marriage and later marginality reduce the chance
#     she was the primary caregiver rather than one helper among many.
#   tier: 2

# - event: 'Single event with prolonged aftermath: In her late teens/early twenties
#     she had a pregnancy that ended in a late miscarriage or stillbirth after days
#     of fever and heavy bleeding; older women and a local healer managed her with warmth,
#     fluids, and herbal preparations, and she was weak for months afterward.'
#   reasoning: Miscarriage/stillbirth and serious birth complications were common across
#     lifetimes; given she had only one live birth and lived long, subfertility or repeated
#     pregnancy loss is a realistic contributor.

Suri was born in a cluster of kin compounds on the dry edge of the Red Sea hills, where seasonal watercourses cut through scrub and sparse trees. Her people spoke an Eastern Sudanic tongue and lived by mixed herding and cultivation, tied to lineage elders and to household rites for ancestors and local spirits. Far to the west, rulers on the Nile demanded tribute at times and drew trade along the river; nearer routes carried salt, iron, and beads between the interior and the sea. Those forces reached Suri’s life as rumors, visiting intermediaries, and sudden pressures on pasture.

She came into a household run day to day by her mother, Sena, with help from Sena’s mother, Rina. Her father, Lema, worked fields and animals but stayed away for long stretches, appearing when disputes with other households needed a man’s voice or when herds shifted. Suri was very small from early childhood, lighter and shorter than girls her age, and the older women kept her close at the grinding stones or seated beside them when they mended leather ties. When she could walk well, they still assigned her work that did not require long carrying: sorting grain, watching small kids near the thorn fence, holding a bowl under a goat’s udder while an aunt squeezed.

Before Suri could remember clearly, a brother, Bori, fell sick and died at seven. After that, Rina pressed protective habits into the children. At the hearth she scattered a pinch of flour into the coals before the morning meal. She rubbed fat on small leather packets tied to wrists and ankles and spoke the names of ancestors in a low voice. Suri learned the rhythm of it: ash, flour, a sip of sour milk left on the ground at the edge of the compound. She copied the actions exactly, then added her own questions—why this ancestor and not that one, why the milk had to be sour, why a certain tree near the wadi was avoided. Rina answered some questions and snapped at others.

Suri’s closest surviving sibling was her older sister, Kena. Kena moved fast and expected others to keep pace. Suri trailed her in height and refused to trail her in argument. At the wells, Kena tried to steer her away from strangers; Suri leaned in anyway, asking where a traveler had slept, what iron points he carried, what salt tasted like at the source. Her brothers tolerated her chatter until it crossed into mockery. Madi, already practical and stern, told her to keep her eyes on goats and her mouth shut. Dika, proud even as a boy, laughed at her size and then tried to order her around. Suri answered him with insults that made older women clap their hands in warning.

She was bold in daylight and afraid at night. If dogs barked, she sat up, listening for men's voices. She checked the thorn gate twice before sleeping. Once, after a distant shout carried across the wadi, she dragged a cooking knife and hid it under the sleeping mat. In the day she acted unafraid. At night she watched shadows and counted animals again and again.

At eighteen she married Kori from a neighboring community and walked to his compound with her bedding rolled and tied. The move was short, across familiar ground, but the rules changed. Kori’s relatives expected her to work hard and show deference. She worked—milking, cooking sorghum porridge, scraping hides, carrying water in two smaller pots instead of one large. She also argued. When Kori’s sister, Jalo, claimed Suri had held back a bowl of milk for herself, Suri shouted back in the center of the compound and demanded Jalo bring witnesses. Elders forced them to quiet down, but the conflict never settled.

The first pregnancy came quickly. In the rainy season of her nineteenth year, fever hit her hard. She bled after days of pain and delivered a dead child late in the pregnancy. Hara, an older woman known for healing work, stayed in the hut with her, warming stones and placing them near Suri’s feet, pressing a cloth to her belly, giving her bitter herbal infusions and thin gruel when she could swallow. Suri lived, but she took months to regain strength. Even when she could walk to the fields again, she stopped to catch her breath and felt her heart race without warning. She slept lightly, waking at small sounds, convinced something was about to happen. That same year, Rina died. The old woman had been slowing for seasons, and now she was gone. Suri made the offerings at the hearth as Rina had taught her.

She returned to work with a harsh edge. She counted grain stores and accused others of wasting them. She inspected the knot on the gate and the placement of jars. Kori wanted a quieter wife. Some evenings he struck her in anger during arguments about food, about her refusal to submit to Jalo’s taunts, about her insistence on leaving offerings at the compound’s edge for her own ancestors as well as his. Suri did not hide bruises. She spoke about them to other women at the well, then spoke about them to Kori’s mother, demanding intervention. Sometimes it brought scolding on Kori. Sometimes it brought scolding on Suri for provoking him.

Trade goods drifted through the local market in uneven waves. In good stretches, Etem, a man who brokered exchanges, arrived with salt and a few iron tools and a string of beads. Suri liked those days. She liked the noise and the bargaining, the chance to hear news. She sat close to Etem and asked where he had been, what had changed on the routes, who controlled the best water points. Etem answered because she was quick and amusing and because she pushed food toward him while others watched silently.

At twenty-five she carried a pregnancy to term and gave birth to a son, Nari. He died the same day. Suri did not accept the death quietly. She pressed for explanations, then for blame, then for actions—more offerings, better guarding of milk, tighter control over visitors. She also sought out Kori at night more than she had before, demanding closeness and then rejecting it, switching fast between want and suspicion. Her marriage held in a tense way for years.

Her father, Lema, died when Suri was in her mid-thirties. He had never been central to her life—more a voice at disputes than a daily presence—and his death changed little in her household. His kin mourned him and buried him according to custom. Suri attended the rites and then returned to her own compound.

The rains failed around that same time. Pasture shrank and herds were moved farther. Grain grew thin. People accused each other more often and more harshly. Kori’s household insisted Suri take the hardest hauling and accept less food. She argued until shouting drew men into the courtyard. One confrontation ended with Kori hitting her in front of others. Suri picked up a stick and swung back once, not hard enough to stop him, hard enough to make him furious. Elders, including Guma, forced a settlement that sent Suri away. At forty she walked back to her mother’s kin with her possessions bundled and no child at her side.

Sena was still alive then, older and worn down. Sena pressed Suri into work and told her she had brought trouble back with her. Suri answered that Sena had sent her out unprotected in the first place. Madi intervened and gave her a space in his compound. Dika offered help only when it suited him, and he kept reminding others that Suri caused conflict wherever she stood.

Suri’s place in the compound depended on her labor. She rose early, cleaned the hearth, carried small loads of water repeatedly, and tended goats close to home. Her small size limited what she could carry, so she made up for it in persistence and in voice. She organized younger girls, teased them into work, then snapped at them when they slowed. She suspected theft constantly, checking jars and accusing people when stores ran low. Sometimes she was right. Sometimes she drove people to hide things from her just to avoid her temper.

By her mid-forties, Sena had grown frail. Suri took on the daily care: lifting her mother to sit, bringing water, wiping her clean, cooking soft porridge and warmed milk, rubbing her sore joints with fat. She resented the duty and guarded it at the same time. If another woman tried to help, Suri accused her of trying to claim authority in the household. Sena depended on her, and Suri used that dependence to secure her own place. Sena died when Suri was forty-seven. The burial rites were done properly, and Suri scattered flour at the hearth and spoke the names of ancestors, as Rina had once taught her.

Kena died when Suri was in her late forties. The loss removed the one sibling who matched her in sharpness and stamina. After that, Suri relied on Madi’s protection more directly, and he made his expectations clear: no public fights that risked alliances, no accusations without proof.

Suri reached fifty-six as a poor dependent in the compound, still working, still waking at night to listen. In the cool season she developed a cough that turned into fever and heavy breathing. Madi’s household kept her inside, propped up, fed with thin gruel and warm water. Hara visited and burned fragrant resin near the doorway while murmuring to the ancestors to open a path and to the local spirits to stop pressing on her chest. Suri died after several days of illness.

Her kin washed her body, wrapped it in cloth and a hide, and carried it to a burial place used by the lineage on higher ground above the wadi. They placed a small bowl of flour and a little milk beside her and spoke the names of ancestors so she would be taken in.
