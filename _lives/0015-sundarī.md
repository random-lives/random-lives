# historical_context:
# - event: Annual monsoon variability affecting rice/field crops (late/weak monsoon,

#     season in the village
#   timing: age 0-6 (one or more monsoon seasons)
# - event: Localized river/stream flooding and standing-water expansion in the lower
#     Gangetic plains (crop damage, disrupted paths/markets, increased mosquito burden)
#   timing: any monsoon season during age 0-6
# - event: Endemic malaria-like fevers and other vector-borne disease pressure tied
#     to wetlands/monsoon ecology (community-wide waves of fever without a single identifiable
#     'epidemic')
#   timing: recurrent, especially monsoon/post-monsoon, age 0-6
# - event: Enteric disease environment from contaminated water/food (village-wide bouts
#     of diarrheal illness/dysentery, especially in hot/rainy seasons)

#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 5
#     connection: Triggered by a household mistake during peak labor season (spilled
#       grain, broken pot, or letting a goat stray) amid food stress from a poor monsoon;
#       links to her high conscientiousness (she tries hard to be perfect, becomes anxious
#       about errors).
#     incident: victim_violence (domestic violence/corporal punishment within household)
#   - age: 6
#     connection: Occurs during hot/rainy season when village water is contaminated;
#       follows a period of community-wide stomach sickness; parents attempt customary
#       remedies and offerings before rapid decline.

#       path to the pond, and clings to customary phrasing in household prayers/offerings;
#       uneasy around strange travelers at market.
#     timing: ages 3-6 (market day/ritual days)
#     trait: Openness (17th percentile)
#   - consequence: Adults remark she is quick-witted; she is used to mind younger sister
#       briefly; her awareness of danger (dirty water) contrasts with limited power
#       to change household practices.
#     scene: She quickly learns seasonal cues (wind, clouds) and remembers steps of
#       food processing; notices which pond edge water tastes 'off' and asks questions
#       about why people get sick after rains.
#     timing: ages 4-6
#     trait: Intelligence (82nd percentile)
# number_of_siblings: '5'
# religion: Household and village rites centered on local deities/spirits (grama-devata),

Sundarī was born on January 12, 324 BC in a small farming village on the western side of the lower Ganges plain, where Indo‑Aryan speech and village shrines shaped daily life. Officials tied to Magadha’s expanding power took grain as tax and demanded occasional labor on paths and embankments. Her father, Nanda, held a small plot and kept seed grain in clay jars inside their house. Her mother, Jaya, ran the household, pounded rice, carried water from the pond, and went to the fields when planting and harvest pressed.

Her eldest brother, Bhadra, had been born in 334 BC. By the time Sundarī arrived he worked beside their father, driving the ox and cutting stalks. Between Bhadra and Sundarī came three short lives: a girl born in 331 BC who died in 330, a boy born and lost in 328, and another girl born in 327 who died in 326. Jaya kept small offerings at the edge of the courtyard and marked certain days with food set aside for household spirits and the dead.

In 322 BC Jaya gave birth again, a daughter the family called Little Nandi. Sundarī learned early to keep her hands busy. She lined up lentils for picking, swept the packed earth until it showed no footprints, and repeated instructions back to her mother. She followed the same path to the pond and watched strangers on market days without approaching. After heavy rains in 320 BC the low fields stayed waterlogged, the footpath to the market broke in places, and fevers moved through the village as mosquitoes spread from standing water.

In 319 BC a weak harvest tightened the household. One afternoon Sundarī spilled a pot of cleaned grain while hurrying to keep up. Nanda struck her with a switch in the courtyard. After that she checked each knot and lid twice and kept Little Nandi close when goats wandered near the grain.

In early March 318 BC several children in the village developed sudden diarrhea. Sundarī began the same sickness. Jaya boiled water and mixed thin rice gruel; Dhira, an older neighbor, tied a protective thread and placed an offering at the village shrine. Sundarī could not keep down drink or food. She died on March 16, 318 BC.
