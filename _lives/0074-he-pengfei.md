#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Chronic sleep deprivation, intermittent clinic visits/medication,
#       avoidance of promotions requiring public-facing responsibility, and relationship
#       strain.
#     scene: Before exams and later before work presentations, he rehearses endlessly,
#       checks documents repeatedly, and experiences insomnia, racing thoughts, and
#       stomach pain; after small mistakes he spirals into catastrophic thinking.
#     timing: Adolescence through adulthood (mid-1990s–2026)
#     trait: Neuroticism (100th percentile) + mixed anxiety-depression
#   - consequence: Earns stable employment and respect despite modest background; also
#       increases frustration when others are sloppy, feeding anxiety-driven overcontrol.
#     scene: In school he solves math/logic problems quickly and tutors peers; in the
#       office he becomes the go-to person for untangling procedures, spreadsheets,
#       and policy details, spotting inconsistencies others miss.
#     timing: School years and early career (1992–2012, recurring later)
#     trait: Very high intelligence (97th percentile)
#   - consequence: Job stability and trust from supervisors; also contributes to burnout
#       and makes it hard to 'let things go,' worsening insomnia.
#     scene: He keeps meticulous lists, arrives early, and double-files documents; even
#       when depressed, he forces himself to meet deadlines and maintain a clean audit
#       trail.
#     timing: University onward (2000–2026)
#     trait: High conscientiousness (80th percentile)
#   - consequence: Lower likelihood of entrepreneurial leaps or major career switches;
#       narrows social network, increasing loneliness after breakup.
#     scene: He prefers predictable routines, familiar foods, and standard career paths;
#       he resists job-hopping and avoids unfamiliar social scenes, framing them as
#       risky or 'not worth it.'
#     timing: Early adulthood onward (2004–2026)
#     trait: Low openness (16th percentile)
#   - consequence: Heightened self-consciousness, avoidance of photos/social events,
#       increased dependence on achievement/work identity, and prolonged singlehood.
#     scene: He is repeatedly passed over in dating; relatives/coworkers make casual
#       comments about looks and 'marriage prospects,' and he over-interprets facial
#       expressions as rejection.
#     timing: Late teens onward (2000–2026)
#     trait: Very low physical attractiveness (0th percentile) affecting social dynamics
# number_of_children: '0'
# number_of_siblings: '1'
# occupation: General white-collar staff (administration, HR, operations, clerical in
#   a company/agency)
# religion: 'Mostly secular: no regular worship; participates in customary rites (Qingming
#   ancestor-sweeping, funeral rituals, occasional incense/temple visit on festivals)'
# sibling_ages_at_death:
# - alive
# sibling_sexes:
# - M
# structured_incidents:
# - event: While commuting to his administrative job in a large city outside Shandong,
#     his smartphone and wallet were pickpocketed in a crowded bus/metro interchange;
#     he spent days cancelling bank cards and redoing residence/ID-related paperwork.
#   reasoning: Living in Chinese cities through the 1990s–2010s (high migration, crowded
#     housing, booming commerce) makes theft/scams fairly common experiences at least
#     once (e.g., stolen bike/phone, fraud).
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Age 29 (2011)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: To save money during a tight period, he repeatedly filed inflated fapiao
#     reimbursements for taxis/meals on business days (mixing some personal expenses
#     into work claims), treating it as a workaround rather than “stealing.”
#   reasoning: Base rates for deliberate theft/fraud are modest; however, ordinary rule-bending
#     (petty workplace pilfering, minor tax/fee evasion) is not rare, especially under
#     financial strain.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Recurring pattern, ages 31–33 (2013–2015)
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime
# - event: After moving for education, he passed competitive entrance exams and completed
#     a bachelor-level degree, becoming the first in his immediate family to obtain
#     a university credential, which directly led to his first stable office job.
#   reasoning: Very high intelligence and high conscientiousness increase chances of
#     academic/career recognition, but his adult status is only working/ordinary and
#     mental health issues may limit standout achievements.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Sustained period, ages 18–22 (2000–2004)
#   type: major_achievement
# - event: He was beaten in a group fight after a dispute near a late-night barbecue
#     stall; he suffered facial bruising and a cracked tooth but did not pursue a formal
#     police case beyond a brief report.
#   reasoning: For an urban Chinese male, the most common violence exposure is school
#     bullying, street fights, or workplace conflict; male sex and high neuroticism
#     (conflict sensitivity) raise the odds of at least one assault/fight victimization
#     event.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Single event, age 26 (2008)
#   type: physical_assault
# - event: He developed chronic anxiety with depressive episodes and insomnia, leading
#     to persistent fatigue and concentration problems; he cycled through short courses
#     of medication and intermittent counseling while continuing to work.
#   reasoning: By his 40s, chronic conditions (e.g., hypertension, GI issues, migraine,
#     depression/anxiety-related impairment) are fairly common; extreme neuroticism
#     and confirmed anxiety-depression increase the likelihood of a function-limiting
#     chronic condition.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Sustained period, ages 23–present (2005–2026)
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: In his late 20s he had a consensual sexual relationship with a girlfriend
#     he met through coworkers; they dated for months and broke up over pressure to
#     marry and housing expectations.
#   reasoning: For an urban man born 1982, premarital sex became common from the late
#     1990s onward; being never married into midlife increases the chance he had at
#     least one consensual sexual relationship outside marriage.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Sustained period, ages 27–28 (2009–2010)
#   type: premarital_sex

He Pengfei was born on January 22, 1982, in Qingdao in Shandong, under the People’s Republic of China, in a Han household that spoke a local Jiaoliao Mandarin at home and Putonghua in school. His parents kept no altar in the living room, but they did what their neighbors did: his father bought incense sticks before Spring Festival, and at Qingming they went to sweep a grave, pull weeds, and leave fruit and paper offerings before burning them in a metal basin.

He arrived as the second of two sons. His older brother, He Wei, already ran around the small flat with a schoolbag and scraped knees. Their father, He Guoqiang, worked construction and day labor, taking whatever was available: hauling cement, carrying rebar, pouring concrete on windy sites near the sea. He came home with dust in the creases of his hands and an uneven temper that followed the job market. Their mother, Zhang Shulan, stayed inside. She had a long illness that left her weak and often in bed. On better days she sat near the window and peeled garlic or sorted beans into a bowl; on worse ones she slept through the afternoon with a damp towel on her forehead. Pengfei learned early to move quietly and to watch faces.

In primary school he carried a neat pencil case and a small notebook where he copied homework twice because he distrusted the first version. He read faster than his classmates and corrected their arithmetic without thinking, then flushed when they stared. Teachers praised him and also told him to relax. At home his father talked about money in short sentences, mostly about what something cost now and what it had cost last year. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, new goods appeared in Qingdao’s shops and street stalls, and prices changed quickly. His father bought a secondhand fan, then worried aloud about the electric bill.

Shulan’s illness shaped the apartment’s rhythm. Pengfei learned to heat water, wash rice, and keep track of medicine packets. Wei teased him for being careful and small, then covered for him when their father snapped over something misplaced. Their bond was practical: Wei walked him to school sometimes, slapped his shoulder when he was slow, and later bragged to relatives that his little brother would go farther than both of them.

By middle school, Pengfei’s body reacted to pressure. He woke before dawn with a tight chest, washed his face in cold water, and checked his bag repeatedly: keys, bus card, pen, ID. He took the same route, avoiding crowded corners where boys shoved each other. He still talked easily in class and laughed at the right times, but afterward he replayed each sentence in his head. He kept a small routine for comfort. After school he bought a skewer of grilled squid from a cart, ate it quickly, and then walked the long way home along a quieter street to stretch the time before stepping back into the apartment’s hush.

When talk of layoffs and “xiagang” spread in the mid-1990s, Guoqiang’s anxiety sharpened. Neighbors who had counted on work-unit jobs started selling small goods or doing errands for cash. Guoqiang was already outside that system, but the mood hit him anyway. He took more jobs, came home later, and argued with Wei about money. Pengfei listened from the doorway, gripping his workbook.

In 2000 he left Shandong for a major city outside the province to attend university. Higher education had expanded, and the campus was crowded with students who had also come from modest homes. The dorm room smelled of instant noodles and wet towels. His roommate Zhao Min joked about everything: the canteen, the professors, the boys who showed off in English class. Zhao called him “Old He” for his seriousness and dragged him to late-night bowls of beef noodle soup. Pengfei liked those meals. The shop was bright, the tables sticky, and the talk stayed on small things.

He studied hard and kept to routines. He wrote schedules on a calendar and underlined exam dates twice. He took part-time work sorting files and checking receipts at a small office near campus. He sent some money home when he could, and he called his mother on Sundays. Shulan spoke softly, asking if he ate enough and whether the weather was cold. Guoqiang asked about grades and then asked about practical things: when the semester ended, what tickets cost, whether the dorm had heat.

In 2004 he finished his bachelor degree and became the first in his immediate family to do so. He kept the graduation photo even though he disliked how he looked in it. He found a stable office job and stayed in that city. The work was administrative and process-heavy: forms, spreadsheets, stamps, phone calls to confirm documents, and the quiet pressure of deadlines. His supervisor Chen Rong valued accuracy. Chen handed Pengfei stacks of paperwork and said, “You check. Don’t miss anything.” Pengfei checked everything. He built a personal system of folders and labels and kept backup copies on a USB drive in a separate pocket.

The next year his sleep broke apart. He lay awake hearing traffic from the road below and felt his mind click through worries in a fixed order: mistakes at work, his mother’s health, money, his appearance, what coworkers thought of him. In the morning he washed his face, drank strong tea, and went in anyway. When the fatigue piled up, he visited a community hospital and met Dr. Li Wen, who wrote short notes and gave him a small prescription for sleep. Pengfei took it for a few nights, then stopped, then returned months later when he couldn’t stand another week of waking at three.

At twenty-six, in 2008, a night out ended badly. He and coworkers ate barbecue at a street stall, drinking beer and arguing over a small misunderstanding about a seat and a bill. The voices rose. A group from another table pushed in. Someone grabbed his collar, and fists landed on his cheek and jaw. He fell, covered his head, and later noticed a tooth cracked when his mouth filled with blood. He filed a brief report and let it go. After that he avoided late-night stalls and ate dinner earlier, alone or with one trusted coworker.

He tried to build a normal adult life anyway. In 2009 he started dating Liu Xue, a coworker who worked in operations. They met at the copier, making jokes about forms that required three stamps and a signature from someone always “in a meeting.” She liked that he listened closely and remembered details. They took walks after work along a river path, ate dumplings in a small shop, and talked about their families. They slept together after several months. Pengfei enjoyed the closeness and the routine of having plans on weekends, but he also waited for the relationship to fail. He read her expressions too carefully. When she sighed, he asked what he had done.

The housing market surged, and Xue’s questions turned practical. Her parents asked about an apartment, a down payment, a timeline for marriage. Pengfei’s salary was stable but modest. He calculated costs on paper and still couldn’t make it work. In 2010 she ended it. She cried and apologized, and then she stopped answering his messages.

In 2011, during the morning commute, he was pickpocketed in a crowded interchange. His phone and wallet disappeared in minutes. He stood near the platform exit, scanning faces, then walked to a police kiosk to file a report. The next days were paperwork: canceling bank cards, replacing documents, explaining the loss to HR because his work ID had been inside. It fed his insomnia. He kept patting his pockets afterward, even when he was alone in his room.

From 2013 to 2015 he bent rules at work. Money was tight, and he felt trapped between expenses and his father’s needs. Coworker Wang Qiang showed him how people padded reimbursements: extra taxi receipts, meals that weren’t really business. Pengfei started doing it too, then kept doing it, telling himself it was temporary. He tracked the numbers carefully and worried about audits, so he made the claims look tidy. He felt a small spike of shame each time he stapled a receipt.

His mother died in 2016. Guoqiang called with a flat voice, and Pengfei took leave to return to Qingdao. The apartment looked smaller than he remembered. After the funeral he stayed a few days, sorting medicines, helping his father clear drawers, and walking with Wei through the neighborhood. Wei talked about practical arrangements. Pengfei nodded and went along, then woke at night with his throat tight and his heart racing.

In the years of heavy haze, he paid attention to air-quality readings and wore a mask on bad days. He booked checkups and asked Dr. Li more questions than before. During the COVID-19 years he followed the rules, scanned codes, queued for tests, and kept his routine even when routines were hard to keep. He still worked in administration, still filed documents, still corrected mistakes others missed.

By late 2025 he lives alone in a rented apartment in the city where he settled after university. He keeps his desk clean and his documents in labeled folders. On weekends he buys noodles and a bag of apples, calls his father, and sends short messages to his brother. At Qingming he orders flowers online and asks Wei to place them at the grave. At night he sets an alarm, checks the door lock twice, and lies down with the lights off, listening to traffic until his breathing slows.
