# Debug information (not displayed on page):
# Age at death: 82
# Agreeableness (% rank): 14
# Birth date: February 6, 53654 BC
# Birth year: 53654 BC
# Climate now: Today the Volta Basin spans savanna to woodland and seasonal dry forests,
#   with a pronounced wet season driven by the West African monsoon and a dry season
#   influenced by Harmattan winds. Much of the basin is heavily shaped by agriculture
#   and major reservoirs, and natural river flow is strongly regulated in places.
# Climate then: 'Around 53,654 BC the region was in a glacial-period background climate:
#   cooler overall than today and generally drier, with strong seasonality in rainfall.
#   River flow and wetlands would have fluctuated with shifts in monsoon strength, so
#   landscapes likely alternated between more open steppe-like savanna in drier phases
#   and more wooded savanna during wetter pulses.'
# Conscientiousness (% rank): 95
# Cultural tradition: undifferentiated
# Death date: December 27, 53572 BC
# Environment: A mosaic of wooded savanna and open grassland cut by the Volta river
#   system and its seasonal tributaries, with gallery forests along waterways, scattered
#   wetlands, and patches of denser woodland on better-watered or higher ground. People
#   would have focused activity near reliable water, floodplain resources, and ecotones
#   where hunting and gathering returns were highest.

#     death_age: 25
#     death_year: -53585
#     name: Yaro
#     narrative_role: Youngest son; bold and risk-taking. Dies in a hunting-related
#       mishap or intergroup skirmish; his death partially softens Yonu’s antagonism
#       into protective vigilance toward grandchildren.
#     sex: M
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 17
#     connection: Occurs during a dry-season aggregation at a dependable waterhole;
#       later informs his guarded, pragmatic approach to partnerships (sex as occasional,
#       not central).
#     incident: premarital_sex
#   - age: 30
#     connection: After the theft he becomes more controlling about where gear is stacked
#       and who watches loads during moves—feeds into his reputation for strictness.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 34
#     connection: Triggered by his low agreeableness and insistence on strict meat-division;
#       afterward his influence shifts toward rules-and-procedure rather than camaraderie.
#     incident: physical_assault
#   - age: 41
#     connection: Validates his emphasis on planning, storing dried foods when possible,
#       and enforcing sharing; also stresses his partnership and kin relations.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 53
#     connection: Forces him into dependence on others’ provisioning; becomes a pivotal
#       lesson in humility and reciprocity despite his abrasive style.
#     incident: serious_accident
#   - age: 66
#     connection: Hearing loss reduces participation in hunts and arguments; it partially
#       blunts overt conflict but increases misunderstandings, requiring kin ‘interpreters’.
#     incident: acquired_disability
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-9
#     key_events:
#     - Grows up near Volta tributaries with frequent seasonal moves between gallery
#       forest and open savanna camps.
#     - Learns early about loss through stories of dead infant sisters; his living sister
#       Kori becomes his closest peer-bond.
#     - Mother Bena dies when he is about 9; caregiving shifts to father Aru and grandmother/aunt
#       Tuma.
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 10-18
#     key_events:
#     - 'Becomes unusually task-focused: keeps firewood sorted, checks fish traps early,
#       learns tool maintenance meticulously.'
#     - Premarital sexual contact with a girl from another camp during joint dry-season
#       stays at a reliable waterhole (age 16–18).
#     - Develops reputation for blunt speech and strict fairness—quick to accuse others
#       of cutting corners.
#     phase: Later childhood & adolescence
#   - age_range: 19-35
#     key_events:
#     - First partnership with Ena begins (age ~23); he contributes reliably but is
#       emotionally restrained and not strongly motivated by sex.
#     - 'Victim property crime during a dry-season move: his knife and cordage stolen
#       (age 29–31).'
#     - Physical assault after a meat-sharing dispute with allied-but-rival camp (age
#       33–34).
#     phase: Young adult
#   - age_range: 36-55
#     key_events:
#     - 'Severe economic crisis during weak rains (age 41–42): hunger, long foraging
#       days, reliance on fallback foods and strict sharing norms.'
#     - Continues as a reliable organizer of routine tasks (water runs, tool re-sharpening
#       schedules, camp maintenance), earning influence despite abrasive tone.
#     - Serious accident from a fall while harvesting honey/larvae near the river (age
#       52–53), followed by weeks of incapacity.
#     phase: Mature adult
#   - age_range: 56-82
#     key_events:
#     - Transitions from active hunting to mentoring and camp work; known for strict
#       accounting of shares and for calling out laziness.
#     - 'Acquired disability: progressive hearing loss begins (age 63–70) and becomes
#       a persistent limitation; relies on Daro and Sena to relay talk in councils.'
#     - Dies at 82 in an accident (already established), likely connected to reduced
#       hearing/mobility and river-edge hazards.
#     phase: Older adult & elder years
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Kato
#     prominence: Most prominent around ages 30–35 (theft suspicion atmosphere and the
#       assault episode), then reappears during inter-camp negotiations.
#     relationship: Older hunter from an allied camp; later rival in a meat-sharing
#       dispute
#   - name: Mira
#     prominence: Ages 16–18; referenced later as a memory when discussing youth behavior
#       and camp alliances.
#     relationship: Girl/young woman from another camp involved in Yonu’s premarital
#       sex; later marries elsewhere
#   - name: Hemu
#     prominence: Ages 25–45; helps channel Yonu’s bluntness into rule-focused influence
#       rather than personal feuding.
#     relationship: Elder counselor in Yonu’s band; informal mentor in speaking at councils
#   - name: Sago
#     prominence: Ages 50–53; present during the honey-tree accident and the recovery
#       period.
#     relationship: Skilled honey-collector and climbing companion
#   partners:
#   - name: Ena
#     narrative_role: First long co-resident partnership formed after years of occasional
#       contact at shared waterholes; practical and work-focused. Ends with Ena’s death
#       after a difficult birth (their infant daughter dies too), shaping Yonu’s later
#       guarded attachment.
#     relationship_end_year: -53622
#     relationship_start_year: -53630
#   - name: Suma
#     narrative_role: Second partnership; more argumentative and socially tangled because
#       camps merge/split. They raise several children; the relationship strains under
#       Yonu’s blunt rule-following and her kin’s suspicions, but it lasts until Suma
#       later dies as an older adult.

#     name: Nara
#     narrative_role: A stillbirth/early neonatal death that his father mentions only
#       in clipped words; her absence is used to explain why women guarded water and
#       shade fiercely in the hot months.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -53655
#     death_age: 31
#     death_year: -53624
#     name: Kori
#     narrative_role: The only sister Yonu truly knows; protective but sometimes exasperated
#       by his bluntness. She teaches him riverbank plants and camp rules, then later
#       dies as a young adult, leaving him with a lasting hard edge about loss.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Earns trust and influence for reliability; also irritates others
#       because he scolds sloppy work and pushes strict routines.
#     scene: He rises before others to check traps, re-wraps spear bindings, and keeps
#       a small kit of flakes/cordage in the same place every night; he is the one who
#       insists on repairing a leaky water-skin before travel.
#     timing: adolescence through mature adult years
#     trait: Conscientiousness (very high)
#   - consequence: Builds reputation for fairness and incorruptibility, helping explain
#       'respected/influential' standing; increases conflict with those who bend norms.
#     scene: During scarcity he publicly refuses a larger share even when he has done
#       more work, insisting portions be divided by agreed rule; he confronts covert
#       hoarding and demands open accounting.
#     timing: economic crisis (age 41–42) and repeated councils afterward
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (very high)
#   - consequence: Contributes to being assaulted and to tense relations with allied
#       camps; later he is listened to but not always liked.
#     scene: He speaks bluntly in council, names offenders directly, and doesn’t soften
#       criticism; the meat-sharing dispute escalates because he refuses to let a perceived
#       slight pass.
#     timing: young adult to mature adult (peaking around age 33–34)
#     trait: Agreeableness (very low)
#   - consequence: Occasionally improves returns and adds to his influence; also leads
#       him into riskier foraging (e.g., honey harvesting) contributing to the serious
#       accident.
#     scene: He experiments with new trap placements along ecotones, is curious about
#       distant waterholes and unfamiliar plants, and listens closely to travelers’
#       reports—then tries variations methodically.
#     timing: late adolescence into adulthood
#     trait: Openness (very high)

# number_of_siblings: '3'

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During a dry-season move between Volta tributaries, someone from a neighboring
#     camp quietly took his well-shaped stone knife and a bundle of sinew/cordage from
#     where his family’s gear was stacked near the sleeping area; it was never returned
#     and he had to rely on others’ tools until he remade replacements.
#   reasoning: Even without formal property, theft of food, tools, weapons, and personal
#     items occurs; in a lifetime with multiple camps and exchanges, experiencing at
#     least one meaningful theft is plausible but not certain.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 29–31
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: A prolonged weak-rains period shrank pools and reduced game; for weeks the
#     band rotated between dwindling wetlands and gallery-forest patches, eating lower-prestige
#     fallback foods and depending heavily on sharing, with several days where adults
#     went hungry so children could eat.
#   reasoning: Hunter-gatherers don’t face debt, but can face severe subsistence shortfalls
#     (drought years, injury limiting foraging, loss of key tools); living through multiple
#     climatic swings makes at least one episode of near-destitution likely.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 41–42 (late dry season into early rains)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: After an argument over meat division and accusations of taking more than
#     his share, he was set upon near the edge of camp and beaten with fists and a stick
#     by two men from an allied-but-rival camp, leaving him bruised and bloodied but
#     able to walk away.
#   reasoning: Among adult males in small-scale societies, serious fights, retaliatory
#     beatings, and occasional intergroup attacks are common enough that this is the
#     most likely way he was a violence victim over a long life.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 33–34
#   type: physical_assault
# - event: While climbing into a riverside tree to reach honey and larvae, the branch
#     broke and he fell onto hard ground, likely fracturing ribs and badly spraining
#     a shoulder; he was unable to forage normally and had to be provisioned for many
#     weeks.
#   reasoning: Foraging and travel near rivers/wooded savanna entail falls, goring,
#     burns, and other injuries; his eventual death by accident suggests a life with
#     meaningful exposure to accidental trauma.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 52–53
#   type: serious_accident
# - event: In later adulthood he developed progressive hearing loss (likely from repeated
#     infections and age), making it hard to track conversations and warnings during
#     hunts; he increasingly stayed near camp tasks and relied on close kin to relay
#     decisions.
#   reasoning: Injury- or age-related sensory loss (hearing), reduced mobility, or partial
#     vision loss becomes increasingly likely with extreme old age in a premodern setting.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: gradual onset age 63–70, persistent thereafter
#   type: acquired_disability
# - event: As an adolescent he had occasional consensual sexual contact with an unmarried
#     girl from a nearby camp during joint stays at a reliable dry-season waterhole,
#     before either formed a long-term partnership.
#   reasoning: Many forager societies tolerate adolescent/young-adult sexual activity
#     before stable pair-bonding; despite asexuality, some premarital experimentation
#     or low-frequency sex is plausible.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 16–18
#   type: premarital_sex

Yonu was born into a small band that moved with the seasons along the Volta’s tributaries, camping in gallery forest when the heat rose and spreading into open savanna when grass seeds and game were easier. No chiefs directed them. Older men and women argued, decided, and enforced rules through talk, ridicule, and the threat of leaving. Spirits were tied to places: a deep pool that never dried, a termite mound at the edge of a floodplain, the line of trees that marked an old campsite. The band fed small offerings into the fire—fat drippings, a pinch of ground seed, a tuft of hair after a haircut—to keep ancestors close and to calm whatever lived in the water.

He came last. Before he could talk, his father Aru and his mother Bena had already buried two daughters. The first, Seli, lived two rainy seasons. The second, Nara, died the day she was born. When Yonu was small enough to be carried, his older sister Kori—only a few years older than him—pulled him by the wrist away from the cooking fires and scolded him when he grabbed at glowing coals. He followed her more than he followed anyone else. He learned the band’s routes by watching her feet. The habit stayed: he watched details other people ignored.

Bena died when Yonu was nine. She had been sick through the end of the dry season, too weak to walk to the water with the other women. One morning she did not stand up when the camp started to pack. Aru wrapped her in a mat and carried her to a rise above the riverbank, where the soil stayed firmer after rains. Yonu did not cry in front of the adults. He picked up the broken bits of firewood left behind and stacked them into a neat bundle, then carried it himself.

After that, Aru took him everywhere. He made Yonu hold the cord when lashings were tightened, and he slapped his hand away when the boy tried to rush. Their conversations were short. Yonu asked questions and Aru answered once. When Yonu repeated the question, Aru turned his head and acted as if he had not heard.

Tuma, Bena’s mother, moved with them for years after the burial. She kept a small bag of powdered bark and bitter roots, and she taught Yonu which leaves soothed a sting and which made the belly turn. She also taught him the order of work at a camp. First water. Then shade. Then firewood. Only then did you look for honey or a bird’s nest. Yonu liked the sequence. When he felt crowded by talk, he went to the edge of camp to sort stones by size for tool work. Kori sat with him there. She teased him about the care he took, calling him “old man hands,” and he snapped back that her scraping strokes wasted time. They laughed once, briefly, then kept working.

At sixteen Yonu traveled with Aru to a dry-season waterhole where several bands gathered. The place was noisy, full of children, dogs, and arguments. He met Mira there, a girl from another camp who walked with confidence and met his eyes without smiling. At night, away from the fires, they touched each other and had sex twice over the weeks of the gathering. Yonu did not seek her out every night, and when Mira teased him for it he answered sharply that sleep mattered. They did not promise anything. When the rains came and bands split, Mira left with her family.

By his early twenties he spoke more in councils than most men his age. He did not soften his words. When someone claimed a broken spear point had been “lost,” Yonu pointed at the track marks near the creek and said exactly who had been there. Some people liked it. Some did not. Hemu, an older counselor, pulled him aside once and told him to use rules rather than names. After that, Yonu started his criticisms with “we agreed” and “the share is this,” but he still ended by staring at whoever had crossed the line.

At twenty-three he formed a partnership with Ena, a woman whose hands stayed busy and whose voice stayed level. They shared a sleeping place, pooled food, and moved together. In time Ena bore their first child, a son they named Daro. Yonu worked steadily: he kept spare cordage dry in a skin pouch, checked fish traps at first light, and replaced cracked hafts before they failed. He liked roasted tubers dug from the wet margins and the taste of smoked fish when the flesh stayed oily. He got annoyed when people left bones scattered where children crawled. He kicked them into the ash and said it was careless.

At twenty-nine Kori died. She had been strong and quick, the person who found edible bulbs in the hardest ground. She fell sick after the rains and did not rise again. Yonu argued with Aru at the grave, claiming they should have moved earlier to higher ground. Aru told him to stop talking and dig.

When he was thirty, during a dry-season move between tributaries, someone from a neighboring camp took his best stone knife and a bundle of sinew cord from the pile of gear beside his sleeping mat. Yonu noticed before dawn, before most people rose. He walked the camp’s edge, checking footprints in the dust, then returned and confronted Aru and Hemu. The knife did not come back. Yonu spent days knapping replacements, each strike measured, his jaw tight. After that he insisted their load be stacked in one place and watched until everyone slept.

Ena died when Yonu was thirty-one. She went into labor at the end of a long walk, and the birth went badly. The baby girl, Leni, did not live. Ena lived long enough to drink water and speak one sentence to Yonu—an instruction about Daro—then she died before the next night. Yonu did not wail. He dug the grave himself, carefully, stopping to sharpen the digging stick when it dulled.

He entered his second partnership at thirty-three, with Suma. The relationship had more friction. Suma's family were quick to interpret tone as insult, and Yonu gave them plenty of tone. Still, Suma worked hard, and she stayed. The next year, at thirty-four, a meat-sharing dispute turned into violence. After a successful hunt, Yonu accused two men from an allied-but-rival camp of taking a larger portion before the division. They argued near the edge of camp. Later those two men caught him when he walked out to urinate. They beat him with fists and a stick until his shoulder and ribs swelled purple. He stood afterward, dizzy, and walked back without asking for help. Tuma cleaned the cuts and pressed bitter leaves to the bruises. Hemu spoke at council and required the attackers’ camp to offer dried meat and a hide as compensation. Yonu accepted the payment without thanks.

Tuma, who had helped raise him after his mother died and whose bitter-leaf remedies had eased his bruises after the beating, died that same year.

Children came in the years that followed. Gamu, a son, was born when Yonu was thirty-five. Sena, a daughter, arrived three years later. Yaro, another son, came when Yonu was forty-three. Yonu did not play much with the children, but he watched them closely. He corrected grip and posture. He praised effort by handing over a better flake or letting a child carry a small bundle on a move. When Daro grew old enough to hunt, Yonu checked his spear bindings each evening and made him redo them when the knots were sloppy. Daro learned to redo them without arguing.

When Yonu was forty-one, the rains failed. Pools shrank, grass seeds were thin, and game moved farther. The band rotated between wetlands and the last green strips of forest along the river. Adults ate bitter roots and small hard seeds pounded into meal. For several days the only reliable food came from what women dug and what children caught in traps set for rats. Yonu measured shares with strict care, cutting portions to equal size and refusing extra even when others pushed it toward him. Suma argued with him one night, saying his rules were making enemies, and Yonu answered that enemies came from hunger, not from fairness.

Gamu died at forty-two during a sickness that hit after the first scattered rains. The boy's belly emptied until he could not stand. Yonu held him while Suma pushed small sips of water into his mouth. Gamu died before morning. Yonu carried the body to the burial rise and placed a small bead of polished shell beside him, something Gamu had liked to roll between his fingers.

Suma died when Yonu was forty-eight. She had weakened after a difficult season and never fully recovered. They had argued often, but she had stayed, and now Yonu slept alone again.

At fifty-two Yonu climbed a riverside tree with Sago to reach a honey hollow. He had done it before and he liked the taste of comb mixed with crushed larvae. A branch broke under his weight. He fell hard onto the packed ground and lay unable to draw a full breath. His ribs hurt with every move, and his shoulder hung wrong. For weeks others fed him and carried water to him. He kept his tools beside him and made small repairs one-handed, insisting the cordage be cut to length and stored properly. When he could walk again, he returned to work, slower, angrier at his own weakness.

Aru died when Yonu was sixty-five. His father had grown thin and slow over the final years, rising later each morning, speaking less at councils. He had stopped arguing with Yonu long before. When Aru could no longer walk to the water, Yonu sat with him at the fire and said nothing. They buried him on the rise where Bena lay.

Yaro died when Yonu was sixty-eight, killed during a hunt when a wounded animal turned and caught him. Yonu’s hearing had already begun to fade by then. He missed words in council and answered the wrong question. He started to sit closer to the fire where he could see faces and watch mouths. Daro and Sena repeated things to him, sometimes with impatience. Yonu snapped at them, then later brought them a share of dried meat without being asked.
