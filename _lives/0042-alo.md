Alo was born in a Yue farming hamlet in the hills of Lingnan, under Western Han rule. Han officials and traders moved along the main routes, but Ken and Mai spoke their Yue tongue at home and used Han speech when dealing with outsiders. Their household held to local spirit practice: offerings at a corner shelf for the family dead, and regular attention to the hill and stream spirits that guarded fields and paths.

Ken worked rainfed plots cut from the forest edge. He carried a digging stick and a small iron blade, and he stored grain in a raised bin under the eaves. Mai planted and weeded beside him when she was able, then returned to pounding grain and keeping the hearth. Their daughter Lia, born twenty-one years earlier, had grown into a young woman who hauled water in a clay jar and brought in bundles of wood.

Near the end of the cool season, on March 10, Alo came quickly. Mai washed him, wrapped him, and laid him close against her. Lia kept the fire fed and warmed water for cloths. On the second day his navel turned wet and foul-smelling. Mai rubbed him with a paste of crushed leaves and ash. Ken went to Sao, a neighbor who served as a healer and spirit-medium, and brought her back with a bundle of charms and a small gourd of liquid.

Sao tied a cord at the doorway and set rice and a bit of meat on a leaf tray for the house spirits. Alo’s skin mottled and his cries thinned. On March 15 he died in Mai’s arms.

Ken dug a narrow grave on the slope above the field. They wrapped Alo in cloth, set him in the earth, and left a pinch of rice and a cup of water beside the mound.
