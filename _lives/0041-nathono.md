# ethnicity: Makua/Makhuwa-speaking interior communities (Eastern Bantu, matrilineal
#   agrarian villages)
# father_occupation: Local lineage leader/headman/chief’s deputy (governance/ritual
#   authority alongside managing household fields)
# historical_context:
# - event: Multi-year rainfall failure and localized drought conditions consistent with
#     early-15th-century southern/eastern African climate variability, leading to poor
#     harvests, food price spikes, and temporary movement of dependents between settlements.
#   timing: most likely during early 1400s, ages ~20–35 (1399–1414), with possible repeats
#     later
# - event: Flooding/very heavy rains in some seasons (cyclone-linked coastal storms
#     and inland runoff), causing crop losses, damaged granaries, and increased malaria/fever
#     seasons in affected years.
#   timing: sporadic, any decade; plausible peaks ages ~10–25 (1389–1404) and/or ~35–50
#     (1414–1429)
# - event: Livestock disease episodes (goat/sheep epidemics and tick-borne illnesses)
#     reducing herds and undermining household resilience during bad harvest years,
#     with knock-on effects on bridewealth/alliances and food security.
#   timing: intermittent, especially adulthood when herds matter most, ages ~20–53 (1399–1433)
# household_social_status: Chiefly/lineage-elite household (headman/chief’s close kin;
#   ritual-political authority)
# household_structure_at_birth: Extended matrilineal kin compound (mother, her children,
#   and nearby maternal relatives; father present as spouse/affinal member)
# household_structure_at_death: Elite compound with dependents/clients/servants in addition
#   to kin (large multi-family homestead)

#   few km)
# mother_occupation: Senior woman coordinating compound labor and storage (overseeing
#   juniors/kin/dependents; less daily field labor)
# narrative_plan:
#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: 1430
#     name: Mawinza
#     narrative_role: Primary attachment figure and early instructor in storehouse management;
#       warm but demanding. Relationship is close yet tense because Nathono’s low agreeableness
#       leads to sharp words, followed by guilt and efforts to make amends.
#     role: mother (senior woman in elite compound; coordinator of labor and storage)
#   - death_year: 1412
#     name: Mpiru
#     narrative_role: Present in early years as public authority and dispute-settler;
#       affectionate in private but often absent with councils/tribute matters. Dies
#       during a difficult climatic period, intensifying household strain and political
#       vulnerability.
#     role: father (lineage leader/headman’s deputy)
#   - death_year: 1395
#     name: Theriwa
#     narrative_role: Ritual and story-keeper who anchors Nathono to lineage memory;
#       encourages her openness (curiosity about distant places and new goods) while
#       insisting on correct ancestral rites.
#     role: maternal grandmother/elder of the maternal lineage
#   children:
#   - birth_year: 1397
#     death_age: 48
#     death_year: 1445
#     name: Nakhulo
#     narrative_role: Firstborn who survives to adulthood; becomes a main support in

#       illness worsens.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1400
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 1400
#     name: Nawiri
#     narrative_role: Neonatal loss during a stressful climatic period; remembered in
#       protective rituals and as a private wound that deepens her later depressive
#       episodes.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1402
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 1402

#       rites, midwives, and household quarrels during pregnancies.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 1405
#     death_age: 19
#     death_year: 1424
#     name: Nathima
#     narrative_role: Daughter who helps with stores and water/field coordination; her
#       death as a young woman destabilizes Nathono emotionally and pushes her toward
#       deeper bouts of depression.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: 1410
#     death_age: 43
#     death_year: 1453
#     name: Nankaya
#     narrative_role: Youngest surviving child; close to Nathono and becomes her principal
#       helper during the mother’s frailty and the grandmother’s end-of-life care.
#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 32
#     connection: Occurs after her father’s death when obligations rise; she nurses
#       an adult relative within the elite compound, tying into her honesty-humility
#       (duty) and later depressive exhaustion.
#     incident: sick_relative
#   - age: 34
#     connection: Triggered by stress around storehouse accountability during unstable
#       seasons; her low agreeableness and extraversion drive confrontation rather than
#       quiet mediation.
#     incident: physical_assault
#   - age: 36
#     connection: Follows marital tension after public assault and shifting household
#       power; linked to her high extraversion/openness and desire for affirmation amid
#       depressive lows.
#     incident: extramarital_sex
#   - age: 38
#     connection: Begins after repeated heavy-rain/fever seasons; reinforces her move
#       into supervisory roles and amplifies depressive episodes via fatigue and pain.
#     incident: chronic_illness
#   - age: 41
#     connection: Drought/poor rains + livestock disease squeeze the elite compound;
#       she must sell/barter goats and prestige goods, raising conflict and further
#       deepening mood symptoms.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 46
#     connection: A wet-season slip while hauling water; accelerates reliance on dependents
#       and adult children, and becomes a visible marker of aging/frailty despite elite
#       standing.
#     incident: serious_accident
#   - age: 47
#     connection: Mother’s decline overlaps with Nathono’s post-accident limitations;
#       caregiving reinforces her social role as senior woman but drains her physically
#       and emotionally.
#     incident: elderly_parents
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6
#     key_events:
#     - '1379–1382: Born into an elite matrilineal compound; youngest brother dies at

#     key_events:
#     - '1390–1395: Apprentices in storage counting, drying, and pest control under
#       mother Mawinza; grandmother Theriwa dies (1395), increasing ritual responsibilities.'
#     - '1396: Marriage/recognized union with Kawina begins; she moves into adult women’s
#       work parties while remaining anchored in her maternal compound.'
#     - '1399: Older sister Namalya dies (1399), accelerating Nathono’s rise toward
#       senior responsibilities and sharpening her blunt interpersonal style.'
#     phase: Later childhood & adolescence
#   - age_range: 17-30
#     key_events:
#     - '1397–1410: Five births spaced across years; two neonatal deaths (1400, 1402)
#       intensify her private grief and contribute to later depressive vulnerability.'
#     - '1399–1414: Early-1400s rainfall instability: alternating shortage and recovery;
#       elite household obligations increase as others seek food or protection.'
#     - '1412: Father Mpiru dies; brother Nankula becomes more central, and Nathono’s
#       marital/compound power dynamics shift.'

#   - age_range: 31-45
#     key_events:
#     - '1411–1414: Heavy-rain/flood seasons intermittently damage fields and granaries;
#       fever seasons worsen, setting the stage for her later chronic illness.'
#     - '1413–1414 (age 34): Public dispute over tools/grain ends in her being physically
#       assaulted, changing how she negotiates conflicts thereafter.'
#     - '1420–1422 (ages 41–43): Severe food shortage and asset loss; she rations stores
#       and barters livestock/valuables, asserting authority while emotionally unraveling
#       in private.'
#     phase: Mature adulthood
#   - age_range: 46-53
#     key_events:
#     - '1425 (age 46): Serious fall while carrying water leads to long incapacity;
#       she shifts further from field labor to directing others.'
#     - '1426–1429: Chronic illness episodes continue; she relies more on surviving
#       children and dependents; social standing remains high but personally strained.'
#     - '1430: Mother Mawinza dies after years of frailty; Nathono’s grief and chronic
#       illness worsen. 1433: Dies of severe diarrheal illness/dehydration.'

#     name: Namutolo
#     narrative_role: Oldest brother and early model of authority; protective when she

#     name: Nankula
#     narrative_role: A long-lived brother who becomes the steadier lineage pillar after

#     death_age: 16
#     death_year: 1389

#   - birth_year: 1376
#     death_age: 23
#     death_year: 1399
#     name: Namalya

#       stores and caregiving.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: 1379
#     death_age: 53
#     death_year: 1433
#     name: Nathono
#     narrative_role: Protagonist; senior lineage-elite woman managing stores and labor,
#       outwardly forceful and socially active yet inwardly burdened by recurrent depression
#       and high anxiety.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: 1382
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 1382
#     name: Nawuna
#     narrative_role: Youngest; dies at or shortly after birth, prompting intensified
#       protective rites and feeding into Nathono’s later vigilance around infants.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Reputation for worry and intensity; occasional conflict with kin
#       who see her as overreacting; increased exhaustion and vulnerability to depressive
#       episodes.
#     scene: During fever season she repeatedly checks children’s breathing at night,
#       interprets minor symptoms as signs of death, and seeks multiple ritual protections
#       even after elders say it is enough.
#     timing: childhood through adulthood, especially ages 10–25 and again ages 38–53
#     trait: Neuroticism (very high)
#   - consequence: Periods of reduced productivity and reliance on others; guilt-driven
#       overcompensation afterward; strain in marriage and heightened risk-taking (including
#       the later affair).
#     scene: After losses (infant deaths; later daughter’s death) she withdraws for
#       days, neglects grooming and social gatherings, struggles to rise for work, and
#       speaks of being 'emptied' despite obligations.
#     timing: first clear episodes ages 21–24; recurrent episodes ages 30–53 with worsening
#       after age 38 illness
#     trait: Depressive disorder (recurrent, impairing)
#   - consequence: Builds influence and networks that help during shortages; also makes
#       her a prominent target in disputes (contributing to the assault episode).
#     scene: Leads women’s work parties, speaks first in compound councils about grain
#       distribution, and hosts visitors with strong presence and storytelling.
#     timing: adolescence through mature adulthood, ages 14–45
#     trait: Extraversion (high)
#   - consequence: Improves household resilience at times; sparks suspicion from more
#       conservative kin and fuels arguments about 'proper' ways.
#     scene: Shows strong interest in new cloth/beads and coastal stories, experiments
#       with different drying/storage methods, and is willing to consult a healer from
#       another lineage when local methods fail.
#     timing: adolescence and young adulthood, ages 12–30 (then resurfaces in problem-solving
#       during crisis)
#     trait: Openness (high)
#   - consequence: Short-term compliance from dependents but higher interpersonal conflict;
#       escalations contribute to the physical assault and marital tension.
#     scene: Confronts suspected pilfering directly, uses sharp language in disputes,
#       and resists being talked down to by male affines, even when diplomacy would
#       be safer.
#     timing: especially ages 25–40
#     trait: Agreeableness (low)
#   - consequence: Strengthens her legitimacy as senior woman and protects her status
#       even when ill; also increases burden and resentment when others do not match
#       her standards.
#     scene: Insists that grain be measured and distributed according to need and obligation,
#       refuses to secretly hoard for her own hut during shortages, and performs onerous
#       caregiving duties without seeking credit.
#     timing: adulthood, ages 20–53
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (very high)
# number_of_children: '5'
# number_of_siblings: '7'
# occupation: Subsistence farmer/food producer (fields + processing) and household manager
# religion: Local ancestral/village rites (ancestor veneration; household offerings;
#   healing/protective rituals; rain/harvest ceremonies led by elders/diviners)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: A run of poor rains left her household short of staple grain, and as the
#     woman overseeing stores she had to ration food and barter away goats/valuables
#     to secure meal and seed; dependents drifted to other compounds until the next
#     harvest recovered.
#   reasoning: Even elites faced localized crop failure, disease shocks, or political
#     conflict, but her lineage-elite position and access to dependents/stores reduce
#     the chance of true destitution or irreversible loss.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: sustained period, ages 41–43
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: During a dispute over a borrowed hoe and missing grain from the storehouse,
#     she confronted another woman’s kin at the edge of the compound and was beaten
#     with sticks and fists, leaving her with bruised ribs and a swollen face.
#   reasoning: As a visible elite household member, she could be caught up in disputes,
#     retaliation, or factional conflicts; still, women were less often targets of serious
#     non-domestic assault than men.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: single event, age 34
#   type: physical_assault
# - event: While carrying a heavy pot of water on a worn path after rains, she slipped
#     and fell hard, injuring her hip and lower back; she could not work the fields
#     or carry loads for many weeks and had to direct others from the homestead.
#   reasoning: Daily farming, water/firewood collection, cooking fires, and carrying
#     loads create real injury risk, but many serious incidents are infectious rather
#     than traumatic.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: single event with prolonged recovery, age 46
#   type: serious_accident
# - event: For years she suffered recurrent bouts of fever and weakness with lingering
#     exhaustion and body aches between episodes, leaving her unable to keep up with
#     peak-season farm labor and pushing her into more supervisory household work.
#   reasoning: Surviving to 53 in a high-pathogen environment makes intermittent-to-chronic
#     conditions (persistent fevers, chronic respiratory disease, parasitic burdens,
#     pelvic/gynecologic sequelae) fairly likely; depression also correlates with chronic
#     limitation.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: recurring pattern, ages 38–53
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: She nursed a close adult relative (likely a sibling or spouse’s kin living
#     in the compound) through a long wasting illness—feeding them thin porridge, keeping
#     fires and water close, and consulting healers—until the person eventually died.
#   reasoning: In extended compounds, senior women commonly provide long-duration care
#     during illness episodes; high mortality means repeated caregiving before deaths.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: sustained period, ages 32–33
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: As her mother became frail, she arranged daily food, washing, and supervision
#     in a separate hut within the compound and delegated younger women to help, while
#     she managed remedies and rituals to protect the elder’s spirit and dignity.
#   reasoning: Many adults did not have parents survive into old age, but in an elite
#     lineage some did; as a mature woman embedded near birthplace, she had opportunity
#     to be a primary caregiver if a parent lived long enough to become frail.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: sustained period, ages 47–50
#   type: elderly_parents
# - event: During a period of tension in her marriage, she maintained a discreet sexual
#     relationship with a visiting man tied to an allied lineage, meeting away from
#     the main compound during work days and relying on kin discretion to avoid open
#     scandal.
#   reasoning: Affairs/secondary partnerships occur in many societies, but elite scrutiny
#     and risks of conflict restrain it; her low agreeableness/high extraversion modestly
#     raise the odds.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: recurring pattern over a limited period, ages 36–37
#   type: extramarital_sex
---

Nathono was born in December 1379 in an inland settlement in the miombo woodlands north of the great Zambezi trade routes, where Makua-speaking lineages held land through women and governed themselves through elders and headmen. Traders from the coast passed news and cloth inland, but authority in her world sat in the shade of the meeting tree, where her father, Mpiru, spoke for their people as a deputy to the lineage head.

Her earliest memories sat inside a large compound. Huts circled packed earth, with granaries raised on posts and fenced pens for goats. Her mother, Mawinza, ran the stores and the daily work with a flat, practical voice. Nathono learned the sound of pestles at dawn, the smell of damp grain, the bite of smoke in the cooking hut. She watched her mother pinch a few grains and drop them on the ground at the base of a post, then touch her fingers to her lips, naming ancestors in a low voice before a harvest pot was opened. Theriwa, her mother’s mother, sat with her back against a post and corrected names when Mawinza missed one.

Deaths came early in the family. Nathono’s older sister Naweya had died as a toddler before Nathono was born, and another brother, Namwene, never lived beyond birth. When Nathono was two, her mother gave birth again. The baby, Nawuna, did not live past the first day. Women washed the small body and wrapped it in cloth, and Theriwa tied a strip of fiber around the doorway of Mawinza’s hut. Nathono grew up with those absences treated as part of the household’s obligations: offerings at the edge of the yard, a careful sweep of the threshold after certain visitors, a refusal to leave a baby’s nail clippings where dogs could reach them.

She was the seventh child, and attention did not fall on her by default. She forced it. At five she followed her older sister Namalya from hut to hut, talking and asking questions until someone snapped at her. If told to sit, she stood. If told to hush, she whispered louder. She liked sitting near the grain baskets while older women joked and sorted out which basket belonged to which hearth. She laughed easily at other people’s sharp remarks, then returned a sharper one and watched faces harden. Mawinza slapped her once for speaking that way to an aunt, and Nathono went silent the rest of the day, then rose before dawn and carried water without being asked.

Her closest sibling was Nampita, born in 1373, who treated her as a shadow and dragged her into games along the footpaths. He died in 1389, at sixteen, after a short illness in the rains. Nathono watched the men carry his body out beyond the huts and felt her throat clamp shut whenever anyone coughed for weeks afterward. She began waking in the night to check on the breathing of whoever slept nearest, pressing her hand near a mouth, then lying back down without sleep.

In 1395 Theriwa died. Mawinza called Nathono to sit with her and repeat the lineage names until she could do it without pause. The next season Nathono learned to seal gourds with resin and to raise smoked calabashes high in the rafters so rats could not reach them. She enjoyed the work that had clear measures: this many handfuls to that basket, this basket to that hearth. What she hated was being told, vaguely, to “help.” She would choose the task she wanted instead, and it often was not the one another person intended.

At sixteen, in 1396, Nathono entered a recognized union with Kawina, a man from an allied lineage. He came with gifts and a confident smile, and he liked standing near her in gatherings, letting people see the connection. Nathono liked his voice and his attention. She also began arguing with him early, when he tried to direct where she should sleep or which work party she should join. In her mother’s compound, she did not take orders quietly.

A son, Nakhulo, was born in 1397. Nathono carried him on her back and kept working, stopping to nurse and then returning to the fields with soil under her nails. When her older sister Namalya died in 1399 at twenty-three, the women’s work shifted abruptly. Nathono moved into duties her sister had held: counting baskets, tracking who owed grain after communal feasts, deciding which dependents could take from which store.

The early 1400s brought difficult seasons. Rains failed, then came late and hard, then failed again. Goats coughed and wasted in some years. Nathono’s second child, a boy named Nawiri, died at birth in 1400. Two years later she gave birth again, another son, Nampiri, and he also died immediately. She washed the small bodies with her own hands and refused help, jaw tight. For days afterward she stayed inside her hut, hair unbraided, leaving meals untouched. Then she would rise suddenly and throw herself into work, snapping at anyone who moved too slowly.

A daughter, Nathima, arrived in 1405, and another, Nankaya, in 1410. Nathono took pleasure in sitting with both girls at the edge of the granary yard in the late afternoon, shelling beans while telling them stories she had heard from travelers: salt from far places, cloth that came in bright patterns, and beads that looked like water. She liked those details. She also liked the small beer brewed from grain when it went right, slightly sour, served in a calabash she kept for herself and close kin. She did not share it widely.

In 1412 her father Mpiru died during a tense season of shortages. The compound filled with visitors, disputes, and requests. Nathono’s brother Nankula, born in 1370, leaned into authority and expected compliance. Nathono did not give it. They fought over who should receive grain when dependents asked for help. She insisted on measuring and recording each distribution with knots on a cord and marks on a stick. When others suggested she keep extra aside for her own hearth, she refused and accused them of trying to steal from ancestors.

At thirty-two, in 1411, she began nursing a sick adult relative who lived within the compound. The illness was slow, with coughing and wasting. Nathono kept a pot of thin porridge near the person’s sleeping mat, changed cloths, cleaned waste, and carried messages to a healer, Mulapwa, who came with powders and instructions. The care lasted into 1412, ending with death and another set of rites, another list of obligations.

Heavy rains returned in some seasons. Paths turned slick. Roofs leaked. Granaries needed repair. Nathono kept walking into the storehouses to check for mold, then arguing with men about replacing posts and thatching when they wanted to delay. In 1413, at thirty-four, a dispute broke out over a borrowed hoe and missing grain. Nathono confronted Sarima’s kin near the edge of the compound and accused them directly. Sticks came out. She was beaten until someone pulled them off, and she lay with bruised ribs and a swollen face, refusing to cry in front of the crowd. Afterward she avoided Sarima’s doorway and refused to attend any gathering where Sarima’s mother sat nearby.

Two years later, in 1415 and 1416, her mood broke in ways she could not hide. She stayed in her hut long after dawn, staring at the doorway. She stopped attending women’s work parties and let meals go cold. When she did appear, she spoke fast and harsh, then fell silent and turned away as if she had said nothing at all. Kawina grew resentful, and the quarrels became loud. In 1416 and 1417, when a visiting man named Chimwala arrived with an allied group, Nathono met him away from the compound during work days. The meetings were brief and carefully placed, and she returned home with her face set, as if daring anyone to question her.

At thirty-eight, in 1417, illness settled into her body as a pattern. Fevers came and went, leaving her weak and sore for weeks. She stopped doing the heaviest field work and shifted to directing others, sitting near the granaries with a staff in her hand, calling out instructions. She disliked being dependent, and she took it out on people who made mistakes. Then she would force herself to give extra food to someone else’s child and speak gently, as if paying a debt.

A run of poor rains struck again when she was forty-one, in 1420. Stores ran low. Dependents began leaving for other settlements to find food. Nathono rationed grain, gave smaller measures, and kept her cord of knots close to her waist. She bartered goats and a piece of cloth meant for display at ceremonies for meal and seed. Men complained, and she answered them in public without lowering her voice. The crisis lasted through 1422, ending only after a better harvest, but the arguments it created stayed.

Nathima died in 1424 at nineteen. Nathono stopped speaking for days, then spent hours scrubbing the inside of storage baskets as if cleanliness could change anything. Nakhulo, now grown, took over some negotiations, and Nankaya stayed close, watching her mother’s face for signs.

In 1425, at forty-six, Nathono slipped on a wet path while carrying a heavy pot of water. The fall injured her hip and lower back. For weeks she could not carry loads or walk to the far fields. She sat near the cooking huts and directed work with short commands, then retreated into her hut when pain and shame rose together.

Mawinza, her mother, became frail in 1426. Nathono arranged for her to sleep in a hut close to her own. She assigned younger women to wash her, to keep water nearby, to warm her at night. Nathono checked the old woman’s skin for sores and insisted that offerings be made correctly: a small mound of millet meal at the base of a post, a drizzle of beer on the ground, names spoken in order. In 1430 Mawinza died. Nathono argued with her brother Nankula about which obligations should be met immediately and which could wait for better stores, then collapsed into silence for a full week.

In 1433, after the start of the hot season, diarrhea spread through the compound. Nathono began passing watery stool and could not keep down water. Her mouth dried, and she lay in her hut while Nankaya tried to feed her thin gruel. Mulapwa came and gave herbs and instructions, but Nathono continued to lose fluid until she died on November 5.

Women washed her body and wrapped it in cloth. They placed her in the burial ground used by her maternal lineage and set a calabash of beer and a small measure of grain beside the grave before covering it.
