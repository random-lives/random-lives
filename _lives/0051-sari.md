#   cultural milieu)
# father_occupation: Local community role (headman’s assistant/guard/messenger/ritual
#   functionary) alongside farming
# historical_context:
# - event: Monsoon variability causing at least one notable sequence of poor rains and
#     local crop shortfalls (especially in rainfed, lightly irrigated interior zones),
#     tightening food security and increasing reliance on forest foods and grain loans.
#   timing: any time in adulthood, most likely ages 20–38
# - event: High-burden endemic vector-borne disease years (malaria-like fevers) with
#     occasional community-wide surges after heavy rains, reducing labor availability
#     during key agricultural periods.
#   timing: recurrent; especially ages 10–40
# - event: Periodic livestock disease or herd stress (cattle/goat illness, fodder shortages
#     in dry spells) affecting traction, manure supply, and household wealth in communities
#     where cattle were key assets.

#   gathering'
# narrative_plan:
#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: 98
#     name: Danku
#     narrative_role: A farmer with a local community role (watching paths, carrying
#       messages, assisting the headman); respected and orderly. Relationship is warm
#       but disciplined—he values Sari’s reliability and gives her practical skills;
#       dies when she is about 31, removing a key protector.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: 104
#     name: Lomki
#     narrative_role: Household subsistence manager; teaches Sari processing, storing,
#       and rationing. Relationship is close, with shared quiet temperament. Her decline/death
#       pushes Sari into full household leadership.
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: 79
#     name: Galko
#     narrative_role: Present in Sari’s earliest years in the nuclear household; keeper
#       of ritual habits (hearth offerings, grove visits). Gentle bond; dies when Sari
#       is about 12.
#     role: widowed paternal grandmother (in household early on)
#   children:
#   - birth_year: 86
#     death_age: 30
#     death_year: 116
#     name: Pira
#     narrative_role: Her only child; raised within her kin network but emotionally
#       closest to Sari. As he grows, he becomes her main support, especially after
#       her leg injury; his adulthood allows her to maintain a separate small household.
#     sex: M
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 16
#     connection: Begins during festival/market-season contacts; her low extraversion
#       keeps it discreet and limited to one partner rather than many.
#     incident: premarital_sex
#   - age: 18
#     connection: Pregnancy forces a return to kin protection; triggers conflict with
#       eldest brother Kora about reputation and future marriage prospects.
#     incident: pregnancy_outside_marriage
#   - age: 28
#     connection: Occurs during routine forest-product hauling while she is a core worker;
#       pushes the household to reorganize labor and increases dependence on her son
#       as he enters adolescence.
#     incident: serious_accident
#   - age: 29
#     connection: Lingering limp becomes permanent; contributes to the household’s slight
#       status decline (less capacity for heavy labor/forest travel, more reliance on
#       others).
#     incident: acquired_disability
#   - age: 32
#     connection: After father’s death (98) and poor rains (c. 98-100), Sari—now de
#       facto manager—negotiates a grain loan by pledging a goat/calf; her conscientiousness
#       drives strict rationing and repayment planning.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 34
#     connection: Lean-season theft from storage follows the debt period; the loss intensifies
#       austerity and reinforces Sari’s careful accounting and guardedness.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6
#     key_events:
#     - Raised in a nuclear household with many small children; repeated infant deaths
#       in the family create a background of protective rituals and practical caution.
#     - 'Learns early tasks: fetching small water pots, helping with kindling, watching
#       younger children while adults work.'
#     phase: Early childhood
#   - age_range: 7-15
#     key_events:
#     - Grandmother dies (c. 79), shifting ritual knowledge more to mother and older
#       sisters; Sari becomes notably diligent and quiet in work groups.
#     - Begins heavier field tasks (weeding, gleaning) and forest collection; shows
#       curiosity about stories/outsiders (high openness) but keeps to herself (low
#       extraversion).
#     phase: Later childhood and adolescence
#   - age_range: 16-24
#     key_events:
#     - Discreet relationship with Jarko during festivals/seasonal work (83-85) leading
#       to pregnancy; family attempts to manage reputation and support her through birth
#       (86).
#     - Continues as a key laborer in natal household; not married, but becomes essential
#       for childcare and food processing.
#     phase: Young adulthood
#   - age_range: 25-34
#     key_events:
#     - Takes on increasing responsibility as her parents age; her son begins contributing
#       meaningful labor.
#     - Father dies (98) and monsoon stress builds; household standing slips as Sari’s
#       unmarried status and reduced male backing matter more in negotiations.
#     - Sari transitions toward heading a smaller unit with her son, while keeping ties
#       with siblings.
#     phase: Established adulthood and household leadership
#   - age_range: 35-40
#     key_events:
#     - Lives with chronic limp and pain; work shifts to management and processing while
#       her son does more outside labor and forest trips.
#     - Mother dies (104), leaving Sari socially more exposed but practically in charge
#       of her own small household economy.
#     - 'Fatal accident occurs in 107 (distinct from earlier serious accident): likely
#       a fall or load-related incident exacerbated by uneven terrain and prior impairment.'
#     phase: Later adulthood with disability

#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 72
#     death_age: 2
#     death_year: 74
#     name: Hina
#     narrative_role: Toddlers’ death remembered in lullabies and avoidance taboos;
#       contributes to Sari’s later caregiving seriousness with children.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Household survives shortages with fewer losses, but she gains a reputation
#       for being strict/unyielding in requests for extra grain.
#     scene: She measures out seed grain and daily rations with a marked stick and insists
#       on repairing storage seals and hearth ash barriers after each use.
#     timing: Most visible ages 20-40, especially during the debt years (31-34).
#     trait: Conscientiousness (very high)
#   - consequence: Fewer allies in public disputes and less protection from gossip;
#       also fewer conflicts and a reputation for calm restraint.
#     scene: At festivals she stays near the women’s work circles, speaks little, and
#       avoids boasting or open flirting; even her relationship with Jarko is kept out
#       of public view.
#     timing: Adolescence through adulthood (15-40).
#     trait: Extraversion (very low)
#   - consequence: Others rely on her in emergencies; she may be perceived as emotionally
#       distant at times.
#     scene: During fever seasons and after family deaths, she remains steady—focused
#       on tasks and ritual obligations rather than panic—comforting others with practical
#       action.
#     timing: Childhood after sibling deaths (5-12) and again during crises (30-40).
#     trait: Neuroticism (very low)
#   - consequence: Reduces open conflict but can leave her conceding too much in negotiations
#       with stronger households.
#     scene: She mediates quarrels over shared water/fields by offering small compromises
#       (labor exchange, shared meals) and avoids escalation.
#     timing: Adulthood (25-40), especially after becoming a household head.
#     trait: Agreeableness (high)
#   - consequence: Occasional small improvements in yield/storage; mild suspicion from
#       traditionalists.
#     scene: She listens closely to travelers’ stories in Prakrit contact speech and
#       adopts a new storage or planting practice she hears about, testing it quietly.
#     timing: Late adolescence into adulthood (14-30).
#     trait: Openness (high)
#   - consequence: Helps her secure survival and reduce shame, but contributes to lingering
#       mistrust among some neighbors.
#     scene: When bargaining for a grain loan or explaining the pregnancy’s circumstances,
#       she is selective with truth and frames events to protect her household’s position.
#     timing: Key moments ages 18-19 and 31-33.
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (moderate-low)
#   - consequence: Debt terms end up harsher than ideal; she compensates through diligence
#       and labor planning.
#     scene: She excels at routine, learned procedures but struggles with complex multi-party
#       negotiations and is sometimes outmaneuvered by sharper traders/creditors.
#     timing: Most evident in the debt and theft aftermath (31-35).
#     trait: Intelligence (lower-than-average)
#   - consequence: Narrows her mobility and social presence, increases dependence on
#       her son, and likely raises risk of the later fatal accident.
#     scene: She reassigns herself from long forest trips to near-home tasks, resting
#       the leg by the hearth while directing younger helpers and her son.
#     timing: From age 29 to 40.
#     trait: Acquired disability (limp/chronic pain)
# number_of_children: '1'
# number_of_siblings: '7'
# occupation: Subsistence farmer/household laborer (field work + food processing + water/fuel
#   + childcare) within her natal/kin household
# religion: 'Local animist/ancestor/spirits practice: household hearth offerings, ancestor
#   remembrance, village/forest spirit propitiation, seasonal agrarian rites (mostly
#   indigenous forms)'

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During the lean season, someone entered her small grain-storage area at night
#     and stole a portion of stored millet/rice and a small tool (a sickle/knife), forcing
#     the household to tighten rations and borrow from kin.
#   reasoning: Even in low-density villages, theft of grain, tools, livestock, and forest
#     produce was common; as a household head she would have had assets and exposure
#     to opportunistic stealing or disputes.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Age 33–34 (one-off incident)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: After a poor monsoon and crop shortfall, and with extra mouths to feed and
#     seed to secure for the next planting, she had to pledge a goat/calf and accept
#     a burdensome grain loan from a better-off neighbor, leaving the household in debt
#     for multiple seasons.
#   reasoning: She experienced a slight status decline and ended up heading a small
#     household; harvest failure, illness, or loss of livestock could plausibly create
#     a debt/food crisis at least once.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Age 31–33 (sustained period)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: While carrying a heavy load of firewood/leaf bundles on a forest path, she
#     slipped on loose stone and fell, badly injuring her lower leg/ankle; she was unable
#     to work the fields or walk normally for many weeks and relied on her son and neighbors
#     for water and fuel.
#   reasoning: As a subsistence farmer/household laborer doing daily field, hauling,
#     and forest work, a nonfatal but serious fall/cut/animal incident causing weeks
#     of reduced function is fairly likely over 40 years (separate from the fatal accident).
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 28–29 (single event with prolonged recovery)
#   type: serious_accident
# - event: The leg injury never fully healed, leaving her with chronic pain and a persistent
#     limp that limited long walks to the forest and made squatting/field work difficult,
#     shifting her work more toward processing grain, cooking, and managing tasks close
#     to home.
#   reasoning: Permanent disability (major mobility impairment, substantial vision/hearing
#     loss) occurred but is less common than temporary serious illness/injury, and she
#     still functioned as a household head.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: From age 29 until death at 40 (long-term condition)
#   type: acquired_disability
# - event: As a young woman, she had a discreet sexual relationship with a young man
#     from a nearby settlement encountered during seasonal work and festivals; the liaison
#     was not formalized into marriage, likely due to kin objections or his prior obligations.
#   reasoning: Because she never married yet had a live-born son, the most straightforward
#     explanation is at least one consensual premarital relationship that did not result
#     in (or survive as) a recognized marriage.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 16–18 (recurring over months)
#   type: premarital_sex
# - event: She became pregnant from that relationship and returned to her kin household
#     to carry the pregnancy; her family raised the child within their household rather
#     than arranging (or succeeding at) a formal marriage.
#   reasoning: Confirmed by her having one live birth while remaining never married;
#     pregnancy outside formal marriage/partnership effectively occurred.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Conception around age 17–18; birth around age 18–19 (single event)
#   type: pregnancy_outside_marriage
---

Sari was born in 67 AD on the forested Chota Nagpur plateau, in a hamlet of North Dravidian-speaking cultivators who mixed fields with forest gathering. The plains to the north and west had kings, taxes, and coin, and from time to time messengers and traders pushed through the plateau edges; in her village, authority sat with elders and a headman, and disputes were settled by families and council.

Her household stood a little better than most. Her father, Danku, farmed and also served the headman—watching paths, carrying messages between settlements, and standing with other men when quarrels threatened to turn into raids. Her mother, Lomki, ran the household: keeping the hearth fed, drying and storing grain, and moving children between shade and smoke as the day demanded. A widowed grandmother, Galko, lived with them when Sari was small. Galko kept a small clay lamp and a bowl for offerings near the hearth. She pinched out a bit of cooked grain, set it down, and spoke quietly to the dead and to the spirits of grove and stream.

Sari was the fifth of eight children born to Lomki. Two older sisters, Tumra and Bina, had died in their first year. Sari grew up with their absence treated as part of the household's order: a few extra words at the hearth, a little more care with newborns, and no boasting about children. Her oldest surviving brother, Kora, was already old enough to herd and carry when she began to walk. Mira, an older sister close in age, took Sari's hand on paths and taught her the names for plants that stung and plants that soothed. A younger sister, Rincha, was born two years after Sari and grew into a capable worker who shared the weeding lines and the grinding stone. Two more siblings came after that: Narko, a boy who lived a year and then died after a season of fevers, and Hina, a girl who made it to two before she too was taken. Lomki shaved her head in mourning and held the toddler's anklet in a cloth bundle for a long time afterward.

By seven, Sari carried small water pots from a spring and learned how to keep ash dry for the hearth. She did not chatter with other children while she worked. Her hands stayed busy—twisting fibers, plucking seeds from heads of grain, sorting what could be stored from what had to be eaten first. When Galko died in 79, Sari watched the older women make offerings at the grove and repeat the grandmother’s short phrases. She kept them in her memory with the same care she gave to seed grain.

As a teenager she joined women in weeding lines and in forest trips for fuelwood and leaves. She listened more than she spoke. When men from other settlements came to exchange salt, iron points, or beads, she understood some of their contact speech from the plains. She asked Mira for the meanings of words she missed and then tried them out quietly at home, not in front of strangers.

At sixteen, she began seeing Jarko, a young man from a nearby settlement, during festival gatherings and when work groups met beyond the fields. They kept it hidden. They met at the edge of the grove and on the path by the stream where women washed pots. He spoke quickly, with more of the plains tongue mixed into his speech than she used. She laughed once when he tried to imitate an elder’s voice and got it wrong; it was a rare sound from her, and it brought him back again. The relationship lasted through 84 and into 85, then ended under pressure. Kora confronted her with questions she did not answer directly, and Danku’s face tightened when he realized she had been meeting a man without bringing family into it.

In 85, Sari’s belly showed. She stayed in her father’s house, and Lomki took control of the household’s story in public. Jarko did not come with bridewealth or elders to make a marriage. Some women made sharp jokes in work lines; Sari kept her eyes on the soil and did not respond. Inside the house she measured out extra food for herself without making a show of it. She ate thick porridge with greens and took whatever small share of meat came when a hunt succeeded.

Her son, Pira, was born in 86. Lomki washed him and tied a thread at his wrist; a ritual specialist came with a small bundle of leaves and ash to mark the threshold and to speak for protection against fever and wandering spirits. Danku offered cooked grain at the hearth and pressed his forehead to the ground. The child lived. Sari carried him against her back into the fields when he was small, and when he could stand she set him in the shade at the edge of work and returned to her weeding.

Through her twenties, Sari stayed in her father's household. No marriage came. Men sometimes looked at her—a few with teasing interest, some with contempt—but no household sent elders to negotiate. She was useful where she was: a steady worker with a child to raise and parents who were growing older. She measured seed grain and daily rations with marked sticks. When she tied storage covers, she checked each knot twice. She did not raise her voice even when angry. Mira remained her closest ally, bringing cooked food when gossip flared and taking Pira to her own yard to give Sari a short rest. Rincha, two years younger, worked alongside her in the fields and at the grinding stone, though the sisters spoke less as they grew older—Rincha had married and moved to a neighboring hamlet, and their paths crossed mostly at harvests and festivals.

When Sari was twenty-eight, she fell on a forest path while hauling a heavy load of firewood and leaf bundles. Loose stone gave way under her foot, and the weight twisted her leg. She lay on the ground until Rupkha, a friend from women’s work groups, heard her and came running. The swelling lasted for weeks. Sari could not squat to grind grain or walk to the fields. Pira carried water and gathered fuel with Rupkha’s help, and Mira brought a pot of thick lentils one evening when the household’s food ran thin.

The leg never healed cleanly. She walked with a limp and pain that tightened after long standing. She shifted to tasks close to home: sorting and drying grain, cooking, and overseeing storage. She sat by the hearth with her injured leg stretched out and gave instructions in short phrases while others moved.

Danku died in 98, after a fever season that took several older men. Without him, the household had less standing in disputes. Kora had always represented the family alongside their father; now he did it alone, and he had his own household to manage, his own temper. Sari found herself negotiating more directly with neighbors—over water rights, over whose cattle had trampled whose field edge—and she was not good at it. She offered compromises too quickly, gave ground to avoid conflict.

Then the rains failed badly. Two years in a row the monsoon came weak and scattered. Fields yielded little. Sari pledged a goat to Nemchi, a better-off neighbor, to secure a grain loan for seed and food. She accepted terms she did not fully understand and later realized how much interest in grain would be demanded at harvest. She tightened rations, stretched gruel with wild greens, and sent Pira farther into the forest for edibles and honey. Lomki, weakening now, watched from the hearth and said little.

The debt lasted years. Sari's careful rationing kept them alive, but it did not make the loan kinder. Then, in the lean season before harvest, someone broke into their small storage area at night and took a portion of millet and a sickle. Sari discovered it at dawn, saw the disturbed dust, and counted the missing bundles by touch. She did not wail. She woke Pira and sent him to Mira's yard for a small loan of grain, then spent the day repairing the seals and moving the remaining stores to a more hidden place.

By 104, Lomki died. Kora followed in 105, worn down by a fever that would not lift. Sari, forty years old in 107, headed a small household with Pira. He was grown and strong, twenty-one years old, and he did most of the long trips and the heaviest work, while Sari managed food, storage, and the steady tasks that kept a household running. She still made offerings at the hearth: a pinch of cooked grain, a smear of oil when it could be spared, and a quiet call to ancestors and to the grove spirits that guarded paths.

In October 107, after a day of cooking and carrying small loads around the yard, she walked down to the stream to wash a pot and slipped on uneven ground where the path cut down toward the water. Her bad leg buckled under her. The fall broke her in a way the household could not mend. Mira and the women prepared her body, bound it in cloth and leaf mats, and carried it to the grove; they placed cooked grain and a lamp at the hearth before taking her out.
