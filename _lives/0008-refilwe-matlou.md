# historical_context:

#   timing: age 0–2 (2020–2022)
# - event: Severe electricity supply crisis ('load shedding') affecting daily life (lighting,
#     cooking, refrigeration, studying, small business activity, and safety).
#   timing: age 1–6 (2021–2026), especially 2022–2024
# - event: 2021 South African unrest and wider period of heightened insecurity (disruptions
#     to supply chains, transport, and local economic activity beyond the immediate
#     hotspots).
#   timing: age 1 (mid-2021) with ripple effects into 2021–2022
# household_social_status: Extreme poverty / very insecure (informal housing or highly
#   unstable income; frequent food insecurity)

#   help; occasional piece jobs)
# narrative_plan:
#   children: []
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 3
#     connection: Occurs in Johannesburg while mother is out doing a short-term piece
#       job; loss of phone disrupts grant communications and accelerates the decision
#       to seek family support outside Gauteng.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 4
#     connection: After relocating to North West, mother disengages from the old Johannesburg
#       Pentecostal church network and begins attending a local prophecy/healing-focused
#       congregation; this becomes part of the new routine and support-seeking.
#     incident: religious_change
#   - age: 4
#     connection: In North West, a Child Support Grant/payment interruption plus loss
#       of occasional piecework leads to skipped meals and temporary doubling-up with
#       relatives; the crisis frames the household’s dependence on kin and church aid.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-3

#     - Born 9 Apr 2020 in Johannesburg during COVID-era restrictions; early clinic
#       visits and paperwork under lockdown conditions
#     - Raised by mother in extreme poverty; reliance on Child Support Grant and kin

#     key_events:
#     - Living in crowded yard/communal housing in Johannesburg; increased exposure
#       to neighborhood insecurity
#     - Decision to leave Gauteng for North West to access extended family support and
#       cheaper living
#     - Shift in religious routine as mother changes congregations after the move

#   - age_range: 5-8
#     key_events:
#     - Starts Grade R/Grade 1 in North West with mixed English/Setswana use; literacy
#       remains emergent at narrative end
#     - Household strategies for food and electricity (borrowing, sharing, cooking during
#       power-on windows)
#     - Ongoing instability but gradual re-connection to schooling, clinic care, and
#       community
#     phase: Early school-age (settling in new province)
#   - age_range: 9-18
#     key_events:
#     - 'TBD in later narrative: educational trajectory under resource constraints;
#       peer group and church youth influence'
#     - Potential increased responsibilities at home (errands, caring for younger relatives
#       if present in household)
#     - Navigating crime exposure and aspirations in a high-unemployment environment
#     phase: Later childhood/adolescence
#   - age_range: 19-60
#     key_events:
#     - 'TBD: entry into informal or low-wage formal labor market; possible return migration
#       to Gauteng for work'
#     - Formation of partnerships/household of his own (unknown/undecided)
#     - Religious involvement potentially fluctuating with work and housing stability
#     phase: Adult life

#     - Not applicable yet (person alive and very young); leave open for future expansion
#     phase: Old age/decline

#   - name: Refilwe Matlou
#     prominence: all phases (focus on ages 0-6)
#     relationship: self
#   - name: Mmago Refilwe (mother; given name to be chosen later if needed)
#     prominence: early childhood through early school-age
#     relationship: mother/caregiver
#   - name: Rre Refilwe (father; name unknown; non-resident)
#     prominence: background presence in early childhood; mentioned around questions
#       of support/identity
#     relationship: biological father, largely absent

#   - name: Malome (maternal uncle; name to be chosen later)
#     prominence: ages 4-8, associated with crowded home and household dynamics

#     prominence: ages 4-8, linked to religious change and community aid
#     relationship: religious authority figure in new congregation
#   partners: []
#   siblings: []
# number_of_siblings: '0'
# religion: Pentecostal/charismatic Christianity (lively services; prayer meetings;
#   healing/deliverance focus; frequent church involvement)
# structured_incidents:
# - event: While his mother was working a short-term piece job, their room in a crowded
#     yard/communal housing was broken into and their phone and some food/paraffin were
#     stolen, cutting them off from contacts and grant-related messages for weeks.
#   reasoning: Urban South African households—especially poor ones—face high rates of
#     theft/robbery/burglary and repeated incidents are common over a lifetime, even
#     if the person is not the direct target.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 3–4 (2023–2024)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: After moving back to North West to stay with relatives, a grant/payment interruption
#     and the loss of occasional piecework led to a stretch of near-destitution, with
#     skipped meals and a brief period where they had to leave rented space and sleep
#     with extended family in an overcrowded home.
#   reasoning: He was born into extreme insecurity and the household already relies
#     on grants/kin support; over the life course, episodes of destitution, eviction,
#     or debt crisis are common in such settings.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 4–5 (late 2024–2025)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: His mother stopped attending their Johannesburg Pentecostal church after
#     the move and began going to a different local congregation that emphasized prophecy
#     and healing services, bringing him along irregularly rather than weekly.
#   reasoning: Pentecostal/charismatic Christianity is common and relatively sticky,
#     but switching churches/denominations or periods of disengagement are frequent
#     in urbanizing, mobile families.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 4–5 (2024–2025)
#   type: religious_change

Refilwe Matlou was born on 9 April 2020 in Johannesburg, in Gauteng, under the government of South Africa’s constitutional republic. His mother spoke Setswana at home and used English whenever she dealt with clinics, schools, and officials. The country shut down for COVID-19 soon after his birth. His mother, Naledi Matlou, carried him to the local clinic with a cloth mask on her face and a folded card for his vaccinations in her pocket. Lines moved slowly. Taxis ran less often. Money came in fragments: a child support grant, small gifts from relatives, and days when Naledi found piece jobs.

Load shedding shaped their nights. When the power cut, Naledi cooked quickly on a single hotplate or lit a candle and watched the phone battery. Refilwe learned the rhythm of it, calling out “lights!” when the bulbs came back. In July 2021, news of unrest and looting filled the radio in the yard where they rented a room, and shop shelves stayed thin for weeks.

In 2023, when Refilwe was three, Naledi left before sunrise to scrub floors at a house in the suburbs. She returned to a broken door latch. Their phone was gone, along with mealie meal and a bottle of paraffin. For weeks she borrowed a neighbor’s phone to ask about the grant and to answer calls from someone offering more cleaning work. Refilwe followed her from tap to washing line, repeating the new rules: door closed, bucket inside.

Naledi moved them to North West in 2024 to stay with her mother, Mmaitshepiso, in a crowded house near Rustenburg. She stopped attending her old Johannesburg Pentecostal church and began going to a small congregation led by Prophet Kabelo, where people queued for prayer after singing. Refilwe sat on a plastic chair and copied the clapping.

In 2025 the grant payment failed and Naledi’s piece jobs dried up. They left a rented back room and slept in Mmaitshepiso’s front room with cousins on the floor, eating soft pap when there was enough. By late 2025 Refilwe goes to Grade R some days, recognizes letters, writes his name in careful strokes, and comes home before dusk when the power is on.
