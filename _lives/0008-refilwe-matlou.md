# father_occupation: Unemployed or long-term underemployed (seeking work, sporadic day

# historical_context:
# - event: COVID-19 pandemic and South Africa’s lockdowns/restrictions (schooling interruptions,
#     clinic crowding, job losses, transport limits).
#   timing: age 0–2 (2020–2022)
# - event: Severe electricity supply crisis ('load shedding') affecting daily life (lighting,
#     cooking, refrigeration, studying, small business activity, and safety).
#   timing: age 1–6 (2021–2026), especially 2022–2024
# - event: 2021 South African unrest and wider period of heightened insecurity (disruptions
#     to supply chains, transport, and local economic activity beyond the immediate
#     hotspots).
#   timing: age 1 (mid-2021) with ripple effects into 2021–2022

# - event: While his mother was working a short-term piece job, their room in a crowded
#     yard/communal housing was broken into and their phone and some food/paraffin were
#     stolen, cutting them off from contacts and grant-related messages for weeks.
#   reasoning: Urban South African households—especially poor ones—face high rates of
#     theft/robbery/burglary and repeated incidents are common over a lifetime, even
#     if the person is not the direct target.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 3–4 (2023–2024)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: After moving back to North West to stay with relatives, a grant/payment interruption
#     and the loss of occasional piecework led to a stretch of near-destitution, with
#     skipped meals and a brief period where they had to leave rented space and sleep
#     with extended family in an overcrowded home.
#   reasoning: He was born into extreme insecurity and the household already relies
#     on grants/kin support; over the life course, episodes of destitution, eviction,
#     or debt crisis are common in such settings.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 4–5 (late 2024–2025)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: His mother stopped attending their Johannesburg Pentecostal church after
#     the move and began going to a different local congregation that emphasized prophecy
#     and healing services, bringing him along irregularly rather than weekly.
#   reasoning: Pentecostal/charismatic Christianity is common and relatively sticky,
#     but switching churches/denominations or periods of disengagement are frequent
#     in urbanizing, mobile families.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 4–5 (2024–2025)

Refilwe Matlou was born on 9 April 2020 in Johannesburg, in Gauteng, under South Africa’s constitutional government, in a Setswana-speaking family that used English in daily life. His mother, Dineo Matlou, named him for a blessing and registered the birth while COVID-19 rules kept clinic queues long and taxi ranks half shut.

Dineo raised him alone in a crowded yard of rooms behind a main house. She kept him close when she went to collect water, buy bread, or queue for a grant payment. In 2021, when unrest and looting shook parts of the country, the shop near their place started closing earlier, and Dineo began buying what she could in the morning. Power cuts became normal. Some nights the light went out in the middle of a children’s program, and Dineo cooked on a small stove when she could get paraffin.

Refilwe talked early and wanted to be where adults were speaking. He followed conversations, cut in with questions, and grew restless when he had to sit still. At three, he learned letters from a poster and wrote the first R of his name on scrap paper. He liked church days because there were drums, clapping, and people who greeted him loudly. Dineo took him to a Pentecostal church in Johannesburg where the pastor prayed for jobs and sickness.

In 2023, Dineo left him with a neighbor while she did a short piece job. That afternoon their room was broken into. Someone took her phone and the small bag of food and paraffin. For weeks she borrowed phones to check on grant messages and called people back only when airtime appeared.

Dineo moved with Refilwe to North West to stay near her mother, MmaSeipati. Late in 2024 a payment interruption and the end of piecework pushed them into skipped meals and a short spell sleeping in MmaSeipati’s packed house. Dineo stopped going to her old church and began visiting a local congregation where services turned on prophecies and healing prayers, sometimes missing Sundays when taxis cost too much.

In late 2025 Refilwe sits on a concrete step outside the house in North West, tracing letters in dust with a stick while Dineo cooks inside and the power flickers off again.
