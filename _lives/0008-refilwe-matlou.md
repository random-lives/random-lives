# ethnicity: Black African (Bantu-speaking South Africans; diverse ethnolinguistic backgrounds)
# father_occupation: Unemployed or long-term underemployed (seeking work, sporadic day
#   jobs)
# historical_context:
# - event: COVID-19 pandemic and South Africa’s lockdowns/restrictions (schooling interruptions,
#     clinic crowding, job losses, transport limits).
#   timing: age 0–2 (2020–2022)
# - event: Severe electricity supply crisis ('load shedding') affecting daily life (lighting,
#     cooking, refrigeration, studying, small business activity, and safety).
#   timing: age 1–6 (2021–2026), especially 2022–2024
# - event: 2021 South African unrest and wider period of heightened insecurity (disruptions
#     to supply chains, transport, and local economic activity beyond the immediate
#     hotspots).
#   timing: age 1 (mid-2021) with ripple effects into 2021–2022
# household_social_status: Extreme poverty / very insecure (informal housing or highly
#   unstable income; frequent food insecurity)

# structured_incidents:
# - event: While his mother was working a short-term piece job, their room in a crowded
#     yard/communal housing was broken into and their phone and some food/paraffin were
#     stolen, cutting them off from contacts and grant-related messages for weeks.
#   reasoning: Urban South African households—especially poor ones—face high rates of
#     theft/robbery/burglary and repeated incidents are common over a lifetime, even
#     if the person is not the direct target.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 3–4 (2023–2024)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: After moving back to North West to stay with relatives, a grant/payment interruption
#     and the loss of occasional piecework led to a stretch of near-destitution, with
#     skipped meals and a brief period where they had to leave rented space and sleep
#     with extended family in an overcrowded home.
#   reasoning: He was born into extreme insecurity and the household already relies
#     on grants/kin support; over the life course, episodes of destitution, eviction,
#     or debt crisis are common in such settings.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 4–5 (late 2024–2025)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: His mother stopped attending their Johannesburg Pentecostal church after
#     the move and began going to a different local congregation that emphasized prophecy
#     and healing services, bringing him along irregularly rather than weekly.
#   reasoning: Pentecostal/charismatic Christianity is common and relatively sticky,
#     but switching churches/denominations or periods of disengagement are frequent
#     in urbanizing, mobile families.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 4–5 (2024–2025)

Refilwe Matlou was born on 9 April 2020 in Johannesburg, in Gauteng, under South Africa’s constitutional government. His mother, Dineo Matlou, spoke Setswana at home and used English everywhere else, from clinics to taxi ranks. He grew up in a crowded yard where several families rented rooms behind a main house, sharing a tap and a toilet. His father stayed away and drifted between short jobs and unemployment.

When Refilwe was small, the country shut down for COVID-19. Dineo queued at the clinic with him on her back, keeping her place with an elbow and a plastic folder of documents. She watched the news on other people’s phones because she had no data. At night, load shedding cut the lights and the sound of music from the next room turned to low voices. Dineo cooked quickly when power returned, then packed leftovers into a container before the fridge went warm again.

Refilwe talked early and loudly. He ran to gates, called to strangers, and tried to join older boys’ games. He copied their English words without understanding half of them. When adults gave him instructions with too many steps, he did the first part and then got distracted by whatever moved—water running, a radio, a ball.

In 2023, while Dineo was away doing a few days of piece work, someone forced their door. Their phone disappeared, along with food and a small bottle of paraffin. For weeks Dineo borrowed airtime and missed messages about the child support grant.

Late in 2024 she took Refilwe to North West to stay with her mother, MmaGomolemo, in a township outside Mahikeng. She stopped going to the Johannesburg Pentecostal church and started attending a local congregation that held prophecy and healing sessions. Some Sundays they went; other weeks Dineo stayed home to wash clothes and save taxi money.

In 2025 a payment interruption and the end of Dineo’s occasional work left them without cash. They slept in MmaGomolemo’s two-room house with other relatives, bodies lined up on blankets. Refilwe now spends his days outside, switching between Setswana and English, tracing letters in dust with a stick and asking to be shown again.
