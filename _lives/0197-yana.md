# narrative_plan:
#   caretakers:
#   - death_year: -3169
#     name: Narit
#     narrative_role: Primary caregiver and household anchor; known for dairy processing
#       and careful storage. Warm but worried; her vigilance models Yana’s later hypervigilance.
#       Dies shortly before Yana (likely from illness/age-related decline), leaving
#       Yana deeply unmoored.
#     role: mother
#   - death_year: -3205
#     name: Taro
#     narrative_role: Not living with the household from Yana’s birth (likely died shortly
#       before/around her birth or was lost to prolonged absence); becomes a ‘missing’
#       figure invoked in ancestor rites, contributing to Yana’s sense that security
#       can vanish without warning.
#     role: father (absent/deceased)
#   - death_year: -3167
#     name: Berik
#     narrative_role: Pragmatic authority figure in the natal compound; provides protection
#       and decisions about labor and stores when Yana returns as a widow. Relationship
#       is dutiful rather than emotionally close.
#     role: maternal uncle (mother’s brother) / senior male in natal household later
#   - death_year: -3192
#     name: Ema
#     narrative_role: Early source of comfort and ritual instruction (how to address
#       the dead, what foods to set aside). Dies when Yana is young, reinforcing early
#       lessons about loss.
#     role: maternal grandmother (early childhood presence)
#   children: []
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 16
#     connection: The theft happens during late-summer storage work; it amplifies Yana’s
#       anxiety and becomes a household lesson about guarding stores, feeding into her
#       later hoarding/checking behaviors.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 17
#     connection: Secret meetings occur around shared labor (harvest/herding) and inter-kin
#       visits; fear of discovery ties directly to her hypervigilance and later sensitivity
#       to gossip.
#     incident: premarital_sex
#   - age: 25
#     connection: Begins after repeated seasons of stress and questionable water/food;
#       interacts with communal labor peaks (she pushes herself, then crashes), and
#       shapes her cautious routines.
#     incident: chronic_illness
#   - age: 28
#     connection: Occurs during a period of marital strain and absences; secrecy increases
#       her anxiety symptoms (checking paths, listening for footsteps, avoiding certain
#       gatherings).
#     incident: extramarital_sex
#   - age: 33
#     connection: Triggered by widowhood plus poor harvest/livestock loss; directly
#       causes her return migration to natal kin and sets up the late-life caregiving
#       role in the natal household.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-6
#     key_events:
#     - Lives in a father-absent household; mother and grandmother structure days around
#       hearth, dairy processing, and burial/ancestor observances.
#     - Witnesses (in family practice rather than memory) repeated infant loss around
#       her—burial tending and commemorative meals become normal parts of life.
#     - 'Early signs of anxious temperament: startles easily, clings to known routines,
#       watches adults’ faces for threat.'
#     phase: Early childhood (natal village, high-loss household)
#   - age_range: 7-14
#     key_events:
#     - 'Takes on meaningful tasks: fetching water/fuel, watching small stock near the
#       settlement edge, helping with curd drying and storage.'
#     - Experiences at least one hard winter/lean season that tightens food distribution
#       and heightens communal guarding duties.
#     - Becomes known as quiet, helpful, and overly worried—double-checking jars, counting
#       bundles, rehearsing what to do if strangers appear.
#     phase: Later childhood (learning work and vigilance)
#   - age_range: 15-19
#     key_events:
#     - Begins clandestine premarital relationship with Arshi during inter-settlement
#       work visits.
#     - 'Victim of property crime during storage season: theft of dried dairy and a
#       jar increases household suspicion and her personal hypervigilance.'
#     - Marriage arranged; relocates to husband Kantr’s community within the region (10–50
#       km), entering an affinal household with new norms/language mix.
#     phase: Adolescence & marriage transition (courtship, theft, relocation)
#   - age_range: 20-31
#     key_events:
#     - 'Primary occupation: household subsistence work (food processing, cooking, storage,
#       fuel/water), contributing to fieldwork and herd-adjacent tasks as needed.'
#     - 'Chronic illness begins mid-20s: recurring GI pain/diarrhea with weakness; she
#       compensates by planning, hoarding small reserves, and avoiding risky water sources
#       when possible.'
#     - Extramarital affair with Zurik during a tense period; she becomes more fearful
#       of gossip and retaliation, increasing avoidance and compulsive caution.
#     phase: Married adulthood (work, illness, secrecy)
#   - age_range: 32-37
#     key_events:
#     - Husband dies; after a poor harvest and livestock loss, she faces winter shortage
#       and reduced standing in husband’s kin group.
#     - Returns to natal compound with few possessions; reintegrates as a working adult
#       and caregiver rather than a dependent child.
#     - Health deteriorates; terminal GI infection/dehydration occurs at 37, after years
#       of vulnerability and intermittent flares.
#     phase: Widowhood & return to natal kin (crisis, caregiving, decline)
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Khela
#     prominence: Ages 6-18; reappears when Yana returns as widow (ages 33-37) as a
#       familiar ally.

#     relationship: Neighbor in natal village whose household is suspected (rightly
#       or wrongly) during the storage theft period
#   partners:
#   - name: Arshi
#     narrative_role: Premarital lover from a nearby settlement; relationship is tender
#       but anxious and secretive, ending when marriage negotiations begin. Serves as
#       Yana’s first experience of closeness paired with fear of exposure.
#     relationship_end_year: -3187
#     relationship_start_year: -3189
#   - name: Kantr
#     narrative_role: Husband in the nearby community (10–50 km away). Relationship

#   - name: Zurik
#     narrative_role: 'Extramarital partner: a man tied to Kantr’s wider kin network
#       who appears during seasonal labor/visits. The connection is discreet, intermittent,
#       and driven by loneliness/need for reassurance; it increases her fear of reprisal
#       and social shame.'

#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -3205
#     death_age: 37
#     death_year: -3168
#     name: Yana
#     narrative_role: Protagonist; surviving child in a string of infant losses, which
#       shapes her anxiety and her later caretaking role.

#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: -3203
#     name: Mina
#     narrative_role: Younger sister who died in infancy; reinforces the household’s

#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: -3202
#     name: Luri
#     narrative_role: Another infant sister; remembered mainly through burial place
#       and periodic commemorative meals rather than personal memory.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: -3201
#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: -3201
#     name: Dara
#     narrative_role: Only brother, also dying in infancy; later used in family speech
#       as a symbol of what ‘should have been’ (a son to help the household), adding
#       pressure on Yana.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Reputation for being ‘overcareful’; she is trusted with storage tasks
#       but also socially teased/pressured; stress worsens GI symptoms and contributes
#       to withdrawal from communal gatherings.
#     scene: She repeatedly checks jar stoppers and lashings before sleep, wakes at
#       small noises, and rehearses ‘what if’ outcomes (strangers, sickness, empty stores),
#       sometimes escalating into breathless panic during night storms or when someone
#       is late returning.
#     timing: Visible from childhood; peaks after the storage theft (age ~16) and during
#       chronic illness and extramarital secrecy (ages ~25-30).
#     trait: High Neuroticism (83rd) + Anxiety disorder spectrum
#   - consequence: Fewer allies in the affinal household; makes her more vulnerable
#       to loneliness and to seeking reassurance in a risky, discreet affair.
#     scene: At feasts or communal workdays she stays near familiar women, speaks little,
#       avoids boasting and public joking; she prefers solitary tasks (grinding, sorting,
#       fire tending) and slips away early.
#     timing: Adolescence through adulthood, especially after marriage relocation.
#     trait: Low Extraversion (18th)
#   - consequence: Often overburdened with chores and caregiving; earns a baseline respectability
#       that helps her be accepted back into natal household after widowhood.
#     scene: She yields in disputes, offers her portion to elders/sick relatives, and
#       avoids retaliating when accused or gossiped about; she tries to repair tensions
#       with work rather than confrontation.
#     timing: Most visible in married household (ages 20-31) and after returning to
#       natal kin (ages 33-37).
#     trait: High Agreeableness (83rd) + High Honesty-Humility (75th)
#   - consequence: Tension with stricter household members; occasional mistakes become
#       triggers for self-blame and increased checking behaviors.
#     scene: She can be scattered and forgetful when overwhelmed (misplacing tools,
#       starting multiple tasks), but anxiety drives compensatory rituals—lists in her
#       head, repetitive checking, re-doing steps—creating a ‘messy-but-careful’ work
#       style.
#     timing: Adolescence onward; strongest during illness flares (ages 25-37).
#     trait: Low Conscientiousness (30th) moderated by anxiety
#   - consequence: Improves household resilience (small practical adaptations), but
#       her low extraversion means she seldom gains overt credit.
#     scene: She notices patterns in which water sources make people sick, times when
#       milk spoils faster, and how to blend stored foods to stretch supplies; she quietly
#       advises safer routines without challenging authority openly.
#     timing: Adulthood, especially during chronic illness years (ages 25-37).
#     trait: Above-average Intelligence (68th)
# number_of_children: '0'
# number_of_siblings: '4'
# occupation: Household subsistence worker (food processing/cooking/storage, childcare,
#   fuel/water collection; general domestic production)
# religion: 'Ancestor & burial-linked practices: tending graves, commemorative meals/drink,
#   invoking deceased kin for protection/fertility'

# structured_incidents:
# - event: During a late-summer/early-autumn period when grain and dairy were being
#     stored, someone from a neighboring household or a passing herding party took a
#     portion of her family’s dried cheese/curds and a small clay storage jar from the
#     edge of their dwelling while most adults were out working.
#   reasoning: Theft of stored food, animals, textiles, or tools was a routine risk
#     in village life, but low population density and strong kin surveillance likely
#     reduced anonymous predation compared to towns.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Age 15–17 (adolescence, shortly before marriage)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: After her husband died and her position with his kin weakened, a winter shortage
#     followed a poor harvest and some livestock loss; her household’s stored grain
#     ran low and she had to leave the marital household and return to her natal kin,
#     arriving with few possessions and dependent on shared stores.
#   reasoning: Ordinary households could be pushed into crisis by bad harvests, loss
#     of livestock, or widowhood; returning to natal kin suggests some disruption but
#     also a safety net.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: Age 32–34 (early years of widowhood)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: For several years she suffered recurring stomach cramps and bouts of diarrhea
#     with periods of weakness and weight loss, flaring after seasonal shortages or
#     contaminated water; she still worked but could not keep the same pace during bad
#     spells.
#   reasoning: Chronic infections/parasites, dental disease, and recurrent GI/respiratory
#     problems were common and could cause long-term limitation; her later death from
#     GI infection suggests vulnerability to such burdens.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 24–37 (recurring pattern with intermittent remissions)
#   type: chronic_illness
# - event: As a teenager she had a clandestine sexual relationship with a young man
#     from a nearby settlement encountered during shared herding/harvest tasks and visits
#     between kin groups, before any formal bride-transfer or co-residence was arranged.
#   reasoning: Marriage was normative and often early, but consensual premarital relationships
#     did occur; her lower mate-market attractiveness could either reduce opportunities
#     or increase reliance on informal courtship before formal union.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 16–18 (prior to marriage move)
#   type: premarital_sex
# - event: While married, during a period when her husband was away and relations in
#     the household were tense, she had a discreet sexual relationship with a man connected
#     to her husband’s wider kin network (a visitor/helper during seasonal work), keeping
#     it hidden to avoid retaliation or disgrace.
#   reasoning: Extramarital sex existed but carried substantial social risk; widowhood
#     could create periods without a formal partner, sometimes leading to discreet relationships.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: Age 27–30 (within marriage, before widowhood)
#   type: extramarital_sex
---

Yana was born into a small farming and herding settlement in the wooded foothills above the Kura valley, where families lived by grain, sheep, and cattle and answered to elders and kin obligations rather than any distant ruler. Her people kept the dead close. They ate and drank for them at set times, and they spoke to ancestors at the edge of the dwelling where the earth had been cut for graves.

Her mother, Narit, had already buried a newborn daughter, Sena, before Yana arrived. Yana’s father, Taro, was gone before she could form a memory of him. Narit did not speak his name much in daylight. At dusk, when the hearth was banked and the animals quieted, she mentioned him as she set a small piece of flatbread and a sip of sour beer on the ground near the family’s burial place. Yana watched without being told to watch. She learned the order of gestures early: a touch to the earth, then the food, then the mouth, then the air. Her grandmother Ema corrected her hands gently, then pressed Yana close, smelling of smoke and milk.

The household held to routine. Narit’s work centered on milk: rinsing skins, heating curd, pressing it, turning it on mats, salting it when there was enough. Yana grew up with her fingers roughened by brine. She carried small bundles of fuel, then larger ones. She learned which pots cracked if cooled too fast and which clay jars held a seal. She stayed small into adulthood, shorter than most women, and her face drew less attention than her quick hands.

When Yana was two, Narit had another child, Mina, who died before the season turned. A year later a third daughter, Luri, lived only a short while. Then came a boy, Dara, and he did not last the month. The infant graves lay close together. Ema took Yana by the wrist for the tending: sweeping away leaves, pressing down the soil, placing a few nuts or a pinch of grain.

Ema died when Yana was thirteen, quietly, in the warm season. Narit kept the tending duties and brought Yana with her. They poured dairy whey onto the ground, not as food, but as a way to share the household's labor with the dead.

Yana was anxious from early childhood. She kept listening for sounds that others ignored: a dog’s change of bark, a man’s quick step on dry leaves, the scrape of a pot lid not seated right. When women laughed over a shared grinding stone, she smiled late and spoke little. She preferred the early morning, before voices gathered, when she could measure water and set grain to soak without anyone watching.

The village had years when rain came late and the grain heads stayed thin. One winter in her childhood the cold held longer than expected, and the cattle stood dull-eyed in the byre. Narit rationed fuel and had Yana and another girl, Khela, strip bark from fallen branches and carry it back in long pieces. Khela teased Yana for counting bundles twice. Yana answered by counting again, slower, then slipping Khela a spoonful of thickened milk when no one looked.

At sixteen, Yana began walking farther with groups sent to help relatives in a nearby settlement during harvest. There she met Arshi, a young man with a narrow face and a steady way of fastening loads. They talked while carrying sheaves to a threshing place and again while moving goats past a shallow crossing. Yana arranged a second meeting at the edge of the pasture, then a third. The relationship stayed quiet and hurried. She kept her hair bound tight and left no ornament behind, but her attention drifted at home and she misplaced a bone needle twice, then found it stuck in a fold of her skirt and felt sick with shame.

That same late summer, when Narit had laid out dried curds and sealed jars of grain and rendered fat, a portion went missing from the edge of their dwelling. A small clay jar vanished too. Yana came back from gathering fuel and saw the space where it had stood. Her hands shook as she checked every other container, pressing each stopper, retieing each cord. Narit questioned neighbors with a flat voice and accepted no single answer. The household began keeping stores closer and watching the paths more closely. Yana started waking in the night to check the door screen, then sitting by the hearth until dawn.

Marriage came the next year, not to Arshi. Negotiations tied Narit's household to a community a day's walk away, and Yana moved there as wife to Kantr. She heard later that Arshi married a woman from another settlement; she did not see him again. The settlement lay in similar forest and field, with the same kinds of animals and pots, but the speech around her sounded mixed, and visiting herders used other words again. Yana learned by listening. She spoke little at first and filled the gaps with work: tending fire, cooking porridge thick with cracked grain, cleaning milk vessels, carrying water.

Kantr was away for stretches, joining seasonal labor and herding obligations. When he returned he expected order: grain measured, hides scraped, pots not left to sour. Yana’s attention could scatter when too many tasks competed, and she started, stopped, restarted. She compensated by checking. She touched each jar rim as she passed. She rehearsed the day’s steps under her breath while grinding.

At twenty-five she began having bouts of stomach pain and diarrhea that left her weak for days. She still rose, still worked, but she moved slower and took longer at the water source, choosing the clearer flow even when it meant walking farther. She watched for which children fell ill after certain rains and refused water from a puddled hollow even when mocked for it. On better days she took pride in a row of sealed jars and in bread baked evenly without scorching. She liked a simple pleasure: sitting outside at midday with a small piece of cheese and a handful of dried berries, eating alone before returning to the heat of the hearth.

During a tense period when Kantr stayed away and Mekri, his brother's wife, criticized Yana's work openly, Zurik began visiting. He came as a helper connected to Kantr's kin. He was older than Arshi had been and spoke softly in the evenings. Yana let him touch her once behind a screen of stacked firewood, then again weeks later, and the secrecy made her more cautious. She avoided gatherings, watched who watched her, and listened for footsteps near the door. She stopped visiting a favorite spot near the stream because it lay on a path others used.

The affair ended when Zurik stopped coming that autumn, and Yana did not ask why. The following years passed in labor and illness. Her stomach troubles flared twice more, once badly enough that she could not rise for three days. Kantr returned from his obligations more often as he aged. Neither spoke much. Mekri stopped criticizing, and the household went on in silence.

When Kantr died, Yana had lived in his settlement for sixteen years. His family kept her for a time, then treated her as extra labor when stores thinned after a poor harvest and livestock loss. A hard winter followed. Fuel went fast, and milk yields dropped. Yana argued once, quietly, over a measure of grain, then fell silent and began sorting her few possessions: a grinding stone she could not carry, a pottery cup, a small bone pin. She left on a clear day with a small bundle and walked back to her natal settlement.

Narit took her in without ceremony. Berik, Narit's brother, assigned Yana tasks immediately—fetching water, cleaning vessels, caring for his wife's mother, an old woman with swollen joints who could no longer walk to the stream. Yana did it without protest. She nursed and fed, washed bedding, prepared thin porridge, and sat through the slow nights when the elder moaned and then slept. Her own stomach troubles continued, flaring after shortages or dirty water, but she kept working, stopping only to crouch behind the dwelling until the cramps passed.

In her thirty-sixth year, Narit fell ill and did not recover. Yana tended her as she had tended others, bringing water and porridge, sitting through the long nights. When Narit died, they buried her beside Ema and the infant graves, and Yana poured the libation herself.

The following year, after a period of heavy rain that muddied the runoff, Yana developed severe diarrhea and vomiting. Berik's wife tried to give her salted water and thin gruel. Yana could not keep it down. She died in the cold season, and her family placed her body in the ground near the others, laying a small piece of flatbread and a pinch of dried curd beside her and pouring a short libation onto the earth before covering it.

**Issues found:**
- [Pass 1] Gap in narrative between ages 30-33 (affair ends, then jump to Kani's death)
- [Pass 2] "older relative with bad joints" not specified
- [Pass 4] Meko from debug data not appearing in narrative despite being "source of gossip pressure"
- [Pass 6] Arshi's fate after marriage not resolved; affair with Zuri ends without explanation
- [Pass 7] Ema's death bundled with infant deaths despite different life phases; long paragraph combining affair end + gap years + widowhood
- [Pass 11] "linens" potentially anachronistic
- [Pass 12] 86% of names were CVCV pattern (needed <50%)
- [Pass 13] "carried her worry like a tool" (simile); "tightened her habits" (metaphor)
- [Pass 14] "his sister-in-law Mekri" relationship unclear; "settled into a wary quiet" vague
