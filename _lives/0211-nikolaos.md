# ethnicity: Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Anatolian provincial, Greek-Christian cultural
#   sphere (Paphlagonian/Black Sea interior)
# father_occupation: 'Peasant mixed farmer (smallholder/tenant): grain/legumes with
#   some livestock'
# historical_context:
# - event: Aftershocks/recurrences of the Justinianic plague (recurring epidemic waves
#     affecting Anatolia via towns/ports, disrupting labor and markets even inland).
#   timing: childhood through midlife (ages ~0-45; c. 559-604), with episodic waves
# - event: Byzantine–Sasanian war cycles and military requisitioning (troop movements,
#     higher taxes in kind, requisition of animals/food, occasional insecurity on roads).
#   timing: especially ages ~13-23 (c. 572-582) and again ages ~44-62 (c. 603-621)
# - event: Major Byzantine–Sasanian war of 602–628 and Persian occupation of key Byzantine
#     territories (pressure on Anatolian provinces to supply armies; refugees and heightened
#     fiscal burdens even if Paphlagonia itself was not occupied).
#   timing: ages ~43-65 (c. 602-624)
# - event: Taxation and estate consolidation pressures (growth of large landholders/greater
#     peasant dependence; more labor obligations and patronage ties shaping village
#     life).
#   timing: adulthood (ages ~25-65; c. 584-624)
# - event: Climate/harvest shocks typical of the period (one or more years of poor harvest
#     from late frosts, drought, or excessive rain; local grain shortages and price
#     spikes).
#   timing: intermittent across adulthood, with highest impact ages ~30-50 (c. 589-609)
# - event: Church calendar and local saint cult/shrine economy shaping obligations (fasting
#     cycles, feast days, tithes/offerings, processions/rogations for rain/health; social
#     coordination through parish life).
#   timing: throughout life, especially adult household head years (ages ~20-65)

#       expectations.
#     role: father
#   - death_year: 621
#     name: Euphemia
#     narrative_role: Household manager; deeply pious and anxious after repeated child

#     death_year: 627
#     name: Euphemia
#     narrative_role: Firstborn daughter; early helper in household production. Likely
#       married out but remains emotionally close; her adulthood shows Nikolaos’s pride
#       and worry about children’s survival.

#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 585
#     name: Theodoros
#     narrative_role: Infant son who dies soon after birth; intensifies Nikolaos’s fear
#       and his turn toward protective religious practices.

#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: 588
#     name: Georgios
#     narrative_role: Second infant son lost at birth/soon after; reinforces the sense
#       that fate and sickness can undo labor overnight.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 590
#     death_age: 27
#     death_year: 617
#     name: Markos
#     narrative_role: Only son to reach adulthood; central to the stem household at
#       Nikolaos’s death (married with children). Relationship is close but strained
#       by expectations and Nikolaos’s occasional corner-cutting.
#     sex: M
#   - birth_year: 596
#     death_age: 1
#     death_year: 597
#     name: Anna
#     narrative_role: Dies in early childhood; her death coincides with hard years and
#       deepens Nikolaos’s grief and vigilance.
#     sex: F
#   - birth_year: 598
#     death_age: 43
#     death_year: 641
#     name: Helena
#     narrative_role: Youngest surviving daughter; likely still tied to the household
#       economy longer than the eldest. Helps care for grandmother and maintains household
#       routines; her competence anchors Nikolaos in old age.
#     sex: F
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 34
#     connection: A run of poor harvests and a household illness coincides with rising
#       dues; Nikolaos negotiates advances from a landholder and becomes a dependent
#       retainer, setting up later access to storehouse goods and the moral rationalizations
#       for skimming.
#     incident: severe_economic_crisis
#   - age: 39
#     connection: After losing independence and living closer to estate facilities,
#       the household is vulnerable; the goat theft reinforces Nikolaos’s anxious vigilance
#       and his tendency to suspect neighboring hamlets while still trying to keep public
#       peace.
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   - age: 46
#     connection: As war burdens mount after 602 and after his first wife’s death, Nikolaos
#       skims small portions from deliveries over many seasons, justifying it as protecting
#       seed, paying dues, and keeping the household fed.
#     incident: perpetrator_property_crime
#   - age: 52
#     connection: A relative’s death (possibly linked to epidemic/war strain) leads
#       to a child being taken in; Nikolaos frames it as Christian duty but also values
#       the added labor for herding/wood gathering.
#     incident: orphaned_children
#   - age: 59
#     connection: After years as a dependent, he lacks resources for separate elder
#       care; his mother moves into the stem household, increasing stress, sharpening
#       family hierarchies, and tying his daughters more closely to household service.

#       on Markos’s widow and/or grandchildren for continuity of the stem household.'
#     - '620-624: Heightened insecurity rumors and heavier requisitions; Nikolaos’s

#   - birth_year: 575
#     death_age: 40

#     name: Eirene
#     narrative_role: Youngest sister who reaches adulthood; married into a nearby hamlet
#       and remains a practical ally for Nikolaos in hard years, later dies before him
#       (likely illness), tightening his obligations to extended kin.
#     sex: F
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Maintains working relationships and avoids escalation, but neighbors
#       learn he will give ground, which can cost him materially.
#     scene: Nikolaos defuses a boundary dispute over woodland grazing by offering a
#       small concession (a day of shared labor or a portion of cheese) and speaking
#       for reconciliation at the priest’s urging.
#     timing: adult life (late 20s to 40s; c. 587-600)
#     trait: Agreeableness (very high)
#   - consequence: Heightened vigilance helps him respond quickly to illness and scarcity,
#       but increases household tension and contributes to a reputation for worry.
#     scene: After each fever season he checks children’s breathing at night, interprets
#       coughs as omens, and makes repeated visits to the village priest for blessings;
#       he becomes irritable and sleep-poor during shortages.
#     timing: from early childhood memories through midlife (ages ~5-50)
#     trait: Neuroticism (high)
#   - consequence: Short-term survival and seed security; longer-term risk of punishment
#       and mistrust if discovered, and moral conflict managed through rationalization.
#     scene: While loading sacks for the landlord’s store, Nikolaos quietly trims measures
#       and hides a jar of oil ‘for the household’—then speaks piously about fairness
#       in public, keeping his reputation clean.
#     timing: adult life (ages ~44-52; c. 603-611)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (very low)
#   - consequence: Improves access to information and small concessions, but also increases
#       exposure to gossip and opportunities for norm-breaking sexual behavior.
#     scene: He is often the one to speak with tax collectors or traveling traders,
#       using quick friendliness, joking, and shared food to reduce demands or gain
#       small favors.
#     timing: adolescence into adulthood (ages ~15-60)
#     trait: Extraversion (high)
# number_of_children: '6'
# number_of_siblings: '4'
# occupation: Estate laborer/retainer for a local landholder (dependent but free)

# - event: During a winter when stores were low, someone cut the pen-lashings and stole
#     one of his household’s goats (and a small sack of dried legumes) from the edge
#     of the estate’s animal yard; he suspected a neighboring hamlet but could not prove
#     it and the landlord offered little remedy beyond scolding.
#   reasoning: Small-scale theft (animals, tools, stored grain) and occasional fraud
#     were common risks in agrarian villages and on roads/markets; as an estate-dependent
#     worker he would have limited protection.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: ages 38-40 (c. 597-599)
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: While working as an estate retainer, he repeatedly kept back small portions
#     of grain and oil from loads he was supposed to deliver to the landlord’s store—hiding
#     them in his household’s jars to cover seed needs and tax payments, treating it
#     as “taking what was owed” rather than outright theft.
#   reasoning: Petty pilfering, boundary encroachment, under-reporting produce, or poaching
#     from woodland/estate resources were widespread survival strategies; his low honesty-humility
#     raises this risk despite high agreeableness.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: recurring pattern ages 44-52 (c. 603-611)
#   type: perpetrator_property_crime
# - event: After a bad harvest and illness in the household, he fell behind on dues
#     and lost effective control of his family’s plot, entering dependence on a local
#     landholder in exchange for food advances and protection; the move reshaped him
#     from an independent cultivator into a bound retainer for estate work.
#   reasoning: He moved from a free peasant smallholder/tenant origin into a lower-status
#     dependent retainer role, which often reflects land loss, debt, or a shock (tax
#     arrears, famine, illness) forcing dependence.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: sustained period ages 33-36 (c. 592-595)
#   type: severe_economic_crisis
# - event: A kinsman’s child (likely from his wife’s side) was left without a living
#     father after a sudden death and was brought into his home; he fed and clothed
#     the child as one of the household for years, expecting the child to help with
#     herding and chores as they grew.
#   reasoning: High adult mortality plus his remarriage and multi-generation household
#     make it plausible he took in a stepchild, a deceased sibling’s child, or later
#     a grandchild whose parent died, but it’s less universal than illness-care.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 48-57 (c. 607-616)
#   type: orphaned_children
# - event: His widowed mother became frail and partially disabled and moved into his
#     house; he and his wife provided daily care—food preparation, washing, and managing
#     her needs—until her death, relying on the household’s adult son for heavier labor.
#   reasoning: Many parents did not survive to very old age, and he was in a nuclear
#     household at birth (not already co-residing with elders); still, surviving to
#     65 increases the chance that at least one parent/in-law lived long enough to require
#     support.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: ages 56-62 (c. 615-621)
#   type: elderly_parents

Nikolaos was born in the spring of 559 in the wooded high country behind the Black Sea coast, in the Byzantine Empire’s province of Paphlagonia. His village belonged to the world of Greek-speaking Chalcedonian Christians: a stone church, a priest who read from books nobody in Nikolaos’s house could read, feast days marked by processions, fasting, and bread shared after liturgy.

His father, Theodoros, worked a small plot and rented additional strips from a local owner. He planted grain and legumes, kept a few goats, and traded cheese and wool when a peddler came through. His mother, Euphemia, ran the household: the oven, the kneading, the jars of oil and dried beans, the swaddling cloths, the endless mending. Nikolaos learned early that the household stood or fell on small decisions—when to cut wood, how much seed to hold back, how to stretch the stores to the next harvest.

Two years after Nikolaos’s birth, his brother Georgios arrived. The boy lived long enough to toddle in the yard and chase chickens, then died in 563 after a sickness that left him limp and hot. Euphemia began lighting a small oil lamp more often before the icon corner—a painted panel of Christ and a small wooden cross—and she had Nikolaos kiss it before sleep. He obeyed without being asked. He watched the adults closely and tried to keep them calm with quick errands and quiet answers.

In 563 Euphemia bore a daughter, Anna. Anna grew into a sturdy child who laughed easily. She and Nikolaos climbed the bank above the stream to look for the first spring mushrooms, and she teased him when he flinched at bees. In 571 she died after days of flux that left her too weak to stand. Father Stephanos came to the house with a small vessel of holy oil and prayed over her; the family carried her to the churchyard under a rough cloth. Nikolaos spoke little for weeks afterward and began listening for coughs at night, counting them the way his mother counted loaves.

An infant sister, Maria, died at birth in 572. Euphemia kept the baby’s cloth tucked in a chest and touched it when she said prayers. In 575 another sister arrived, Eirene, who lived. Nikolaos treated her like a charge assigned to him. When his father sent him to gather kindling, he brought Eirene along and told her stories he had heard from older men—tales of soldiers and taxes, of distant cities whose names he could not place on any path.

Men spoke more about war when Nikolaos reached his teens. Men passed through with news of fighting against the Persians and of officials demanding grain and beasts for the emperor’s needs. Theodoros dealt with collectors by feeding them and speaking softly, and Nikolaos copied him. He learned to offer a stool, to pour watered wine, to agree quickly, then bargain in small steps. He liked the talk itself, the chance to ask questions, to trade jokes, to hear what was happening on the roads.

Theodoros died in 586. Nikolaos took on the heavier work without ceremony: plowing behind a small team, pruning, hauling wood. His mother leaned on him. He did not refuse her anything, but he also watched his own advantage. When a neighbor offered to swap a goat kid for a worn plowshare, Nikolaos pressed until he got an extra skin of cheese with it, smiling the whole time.

He married his first wife, also named Eirene, in 580 when he was twenty-one. Her family brought a modest dowry—woven cloth, a jar of oil, a few copper pieces. Their household stood on its own edge of the village, close enough to hear church bells, far enough that the goats could be penned by the scrub. Nikolaos enjoyed sitting with friends after work, especially with a man named Doros from a nearby hamlet who could imitate the local tax agent’s voice and make everyone laugh. Nikolaos laughed loudest, then remembered himself and glanced around to see who might repeat the joke.

Their first child, a daughter, was born in 581. Nikolaos named her Euphemia after his mother. He took pride in the baby’s steady gaze and in how quickly his wife learned to soothe her. A son, Theodoros, arrived in 585 and died the same day. Nikolaos washed his hands, went to the church, and stood in the narthex while Father Stephanos read prayers; he returned home and carried water until dark. Another son, Georgios, was born in 588 and died soon after birth. Nikolaos began keeping small scraps—extra kindling, a bit of smoked meat—hidden in a clay jar behind stacked firewood, telling himself it was for emergencies.

Markos, his third son, was born in 590 and lived. Nikolaos watched the boy’s chest each night for months. He brought Father Stephanos a small gift of oil at Easter and asked for a blessing for the child, then complained about the priest's slow chanting to Doros later.

Bad weather ruined crops in 592. Then illness came through the village, taking strength from adults and leaving fields untended. Nikolaos fell behind on dues. He went to a local estate manager, Komēs Leon, and took advances of grain and oil. In exchange he gave up control of his family’s plot and entered Leon’s service as a dependent retainer. He carried loads, mended fences, guarded animals, and answered when called. The arrangement kept his household fed, but each season brought more obligations.

A daughter, Anna, was born in 596 and died the following year. The next winter was hard. In 598, with stores already low, someone cut the lashings on the pen at the edge of the estate’s animal yard and drove off one of Nikolaos’s goats. A small sack of dried legumes vanished too. Nikolaos confronted Doros with a smile that held no warmth, asking questions in a casual tone. Doros swore and laughed it off. Nikolaos carried the complaint to Komēs Leon, who scolded the workers in public and did nothing else. After that, Nikolaos slept lightly and woke at small noises outside.

His youngest daughter, Helena, was born in 598. She grew quickly into a capable child who did not cry much and learned to turn bread at the oven with steady hands. Nikolaos’s older daughter Euphemia helped her mother with grinding and water-carrying. When Nikolaos had a good day, he brought home roasted chestnuts or a bit of honeycomb from a trader. He liked eating in the yard at dusk, sitting on a flat stone by the wall where he could see the path.

The years after 602 brought heavier demands. Soldiers moved through and requisitioning grew sharper. In 603 Nikolaos’s first wife Eirene died after a short illness. The house went ragged for a season. Two years later he married Theodora, a widow from a nearby settlement, and brought her into the household. She organized the work without asking permission. Nikolaos liked that she spoke directly to him in private, then presented a calm face in public.

From 603 to 611, Nikolaos handled deliveries to Komēs Leon’s storehouse: sacks of grain, jars of oil, measures of beans. He began keeping back small portions. A handful of grain stuck in the fold of a cloak, a ladle of oil poured into his own jar before the seal was set. He told Theodora it was for seed and for taxes, and she accepted it as long as it stayed small and did not draw notice. In front of Father Stephanos he spoke about fairness, nodding gravely when the priest warned against theft.

In 607 a child from Theodora's kin was brought to their door after the child’s father died suddenly. Nikolaos took the child in. He fed and clothed the orphan and set chores early: watching goats, gathering brush, carrying water. Nikolaos treated the child with a mix of warmth and calculation, praising quick work, correcting slowly, always aware of what an extra pair of hands meant.

Eirene, Nikolaos’s youngest sister, died in 615 at forty. That same year his mother Euphemia, widowed for decades, became frail and half-lamed. Nikolaos brought her into his house. Theodora washed her and fed her softened bread. The household relied on Markos for heavier labor, and Markos had married Aikaterine by then, bringing her into the stem household with their small children. Nikolaos liked listening to Aikaterine’s practical talk about stores and tools; it calmed him more than prayers did, though he still asked Father Stephanos for blessings and kept the oil lamp lit at the icon corner.

Markos died in 617 at twenty-seven. Nikolaos did not argue about work that week; he agreed to everything, signed on for extra days, and then quietly took more from what passed through his hands. Aikaterine stayed in the household with her children, and Nikolaos treated her with careful politeness, watching for any sign she might leave and take the grandchildren away.

The last years brought rumors of new enemies in the south and more pressure from officials. Nikolaos complained about collectors in low voices, then served them bread and watered wine. He avoided open quarrels, smoothing disagreements with small concessions. He also kept his own counsel about stores, hiding jars and counting measures twice.

In early April of 624, after returning from estate work, Nikolaos sat down in the yard and tried to speak. His right arm jerked and fell slack. Theodora and Aikaterine pulled him onto a mat, and Father Stephanos came and prayed over him, touching his forehead with oil. Nikolaos died that day. They washed him, wrapped him in cloth, and carried him to the churchyard, where Father Stephanos read the burial prayers and the family placed a small lamp and a bit of bread near the grave before covering it.
