Ambiknos was born in late April of 628 BC on a rise above the Duero, where scrub oak and low brush grew between small barley plots. The house was long and low. An older kinsman slept nearest the hearth, with his parents and the other children along the walls.

His father split his time between the fields and the animals: breaking soil, sowing, cutting, and then moving sheep and a few cattle onto stubble when the grain was in. He mended wattled hurdles and kept the herd close to home. His mother kept the inside running. She rose before light, pulled heat from yesterday’s embers, ground grain on stone, and set a pot on the fire while the older children hauled water and minded the youngest.

He was the sixth child. Two sons had already been lost. One had lived only long enough to be cleaned and wrapped. No one spoke their names. Work still had to be done, and grief stayed inside the house.

On the day Ambiknos was first carried outside, his mother’s sister took a small cup of thin grain-ale to the spring below the fields. She poured it onto the stones as an offering, wet her fingers, and touched the baby’s forehead with cold water.

He would not take the breast well. By the fifth day he felt hot to the touch, and the cord stump turned red and began to weep. His mother washed him and rubbed him clean with warm water, then kept him against her under her cloak through the night, sitting upright so he would not slip from her arms.

On the eighth morning, just after first light, his breathing grew shallow and stopped. His father wrapped him in a strip of cloth and carried him down toward the spring alone, leaving the others at the house.
