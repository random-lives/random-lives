Tari was born on October 19, 933, in a small Macro-Jê–speaking settlement in the interior forests of what is now southern Bahia. Elders settled disputes, hunting parties moved through familiar paths, and families kept gardens of roots and fruiting plants near their shelters. Spirits of water, animals, and the dead mattered in daily decisions. Smoke, song, and painted markings were used to protect children and to treat sickness.

Teko had already buried five children. Kanuit died in 923, Mekol in 925, Romi in 927. Wani lived to three and died in 931. Sanit was born in 932 and died before the next dry season ended. Tari arrived after those losses, and Teko kept him close, feeding him often and watching his stools and appetite. Pakul, Tari's father, hunted more than he gardened. He left with other men for days and returned with meat, skins, and sinew cord, then went out again.

Tari slept most nights in his grandmother Kema's shelter. She raised him under a foster arrangement that placed him with elders. She carried him while she fetched water, split firewood, and checked small traps at the edge of the clearing. Warok, his grandfather, walked with them until his death in 936, when Tari was two; after that, Kema relied more on her daughter's sister, Mirat, for help. Mirat watched Tari in the afternoons while Kema worked the garden, letting him dig in the dirt beside her or chase beetles between the root mounds.

Midway through 936, Tari began using short, repeated syllables for the people closest to him. He called Kema by a clipped form he used only for her. One afternoon he pointed at strips of smoked meat hanging above the hearth, demanded a share, and carried the piece away to gnaw behind a storage basket.

Late in 937, on a water trip, he pulled free and stepped onto a slick bank to reach a floating leaf. Kema seized his upper arm and held him until he stopped twisting, then made him sit and watch while she filled the vessel.

In early February 938, Tari developed sudden diarrhea. Kema gave him thin gruel and water; Rakut sang over him and blew smoke across his face and chest. Tari died on February 12, 938. They wrapped him in woven fiber, painted him with red pigment, and buried him at the edge of the settlement with small pieces of food and a shell cup.

REVIEW CHANGELOG (2026-01-20):

Passes with no issues: 1 (Timeline), 2 (Household), 3 (Siblings), 5 (Deaths), 6 (Events), 7 (Paragraphs), 8 (Chronology), 9 (Vague Language), 10 (Abstract Claims), 11 (Anachronisms), 13 (AI-Slop)

Passes with fixes:
- Pass 4 (Character Tracking): Mirat was introduced but never did anything concrete. Added sentence showing her watching Tari in afternoons, letting him dig in dirt and chase beetles.
- Pass 12 (Naming Patterns): All 12 names were CVCV pattern. Varied names to break monotony: Kanu→Kanuit, Meko→Mekol, Sani→Sanit, Paku→Pakul, Waro→Warok, Mira→Mirat, Raku→Rakut. Now 5/12 CVCV (Tari, Teko, Kema, Romi, Wani).

Story was solid overall - clear family structure, appropriate historical detail for 10th-century Macro-Jê community, concrete developmental moments. Main improvements were name variation and giving Mirat a concrete action.
