#     narrative_role: 'Primary biological parent; worked in gardens, gathered foods,

#     narrative_role: 'Notable hunter who supplied meat/skins and spent long stretches

Tari was born on October 19, 933, in the forested uplands above the rivers of what is now southern Bahia. His people spoke a Macro-Jê tongue and lived in small settlements tied together by family, hunting paths, and garden clearings; leadership rested with respected elders and war leaders, not distant rulers. Spirits were approached through curing rites and protective songs, with smoke, food, and painted markings used to shield children.

His mother, Tekora, had carried five children before him. Kunan, Mek, and Romitu died as infants. Wanira lived to three and died in 931. Sani was born in 932 and died before her first rains. When Tari arrived, Tekora fed him mashed roots and soft fruits as he grew, and kept him close during garden work. His father, Pakuran, returned from hunting with meat and hides, staying a few nights, then leaving again with a bow and a small group of men.

Tari slept most often in his maternal grandmother Kematu's shelter, part of a foster arrangement that put him under an elder's steady care. Kematu carried him on her hip to fetch water and to check traps near the edge of the clearing. His grandfather Warok died in 936, and the household tightened around Kematu.

In early February of 938, Tari developed sudden diarrhea. Kematu boiled water and mixed thin gruel; Rakuri, the healer, sang over him and rubbed his belly with warmed leaves, blowing smoke across his chest and face. Tari died on February 12. They wrapped him in woven fiber, painted his skin with red pigment, and placed him in the earth at the edge of the settlement with small food pieces and a shell cup.
