Govinda was born on February 25, 1561, in Cholasamudram, a dry village in the uplands of Rayalaseema where Telugu was spoken in every courtyard. Local headmen collected revenue for distant rulers and their agents, and the village temple and small shrines set the rhythm of days.

His father, Narayana, ploughed dry fields outside the settlement. When the rains came, he pushed the wooden plough through hard soil and sowed millets and pulses. When they failed, he broke clods anyway and planned for the next season. Govinda’s mother, Lakshmamma, ran the house and worked beside him in the fields. She carried water in earthen pots, weeded with a short hoe, and spread grain to dry on packed earth near the doorway.

Govinda was the third child. Two older brothers, Thimmayya and Mallayya, were already old enough to herd goats away from the sown plots and to fetch bundles of thorn for the cooking fire. Two older sisters, Nagamma and Devamma, watched the smaller children and hushed them when the men came in tired. After Govinda came two more boys, Chinnayya and Basavanna, born in later years.

Govinda spent most days on Lakshmamma’s hip or on a mat in the shade. Oil was rubbed into his skin after bathing. A small lamp was lit in front of the household gods at dusk, and food was set aside before anyone ate.

In late summer of 1562, his food turned thin and he stopped keeping it down. His stools ran. Lakshmamma tried rice-water and buttermilk, then withheld food and gave sips from a small cup. By August 31, 1562, Govinda lay still on the mat and did not take more water.
