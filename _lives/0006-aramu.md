#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-4
#     key_events:
#     - Born into a poor mother-headed household; father already absent/deceased, household
#       relies on maternal kin and neighbors.
#     - Household ancestor offerings and seasonal petitions are a stable routine (food/drink
#       set out at hearth; small offerings at graves).
#     - Repeated infant loss in the family (younger sister and younger brother later)
#       creates a background of anxiety around sickness and cold.
#     phase: Infancy and very early childhood
#   - age_range: 5-9
#     key_events:
#     - 'Begins helping with coastal subsistence: collecting kindling, carrying water,
#       helping mend lines/nets, sorting small fish/shellfish.'
#     - 'Frontier pressures become more visible: visits from local headmen’s messengers
#       or demands for labor/food contributions.'
#     - Mother seeks more stable support; courtship/remarriage negotiations begin or
#       intensify with a man from a nearby household.
#     phase: Later childhood (learning work and the shore)
#   - age_range: 10-13
#     key_events:
#     - Mother remarries; Aramu now lives in a stepfather-present household with blended
#       obligations and potential step-siblings/extra mouths.
#     - 'Winters are harsher in memory: storms and icing reduce fishing days; fuel and
#       stored grain become tight.'
#     - Aramu is trusted with more independent tasks (checking lines, helping beach
#       boats), while still not forming his own household.
#     phase: Early adolescence (stepfather household, heavier labor)
#   - age_range: 14-16
#     key_events:
#     - 'Primary work is seasonal fishing and processing: drying fish, carrying net
#       weights, guarding bundles on the strand.'
#     - Experiences a property crime (theft from the family’s drying/storage bundle),
#       sharpening awareness of scarcity and mistrust between households.
#     - Dies at 16 of an acute febrile infectious illness after a short course (high
#       fever, weakness), during a season when sickness circulates locally.

#       but also gets distracted and wanders, drawing reprimands for not sticking to
#       routine.
#     scene: He lingers at the edge of gatherings to listen to travelers/older fishers,
#       imitates unfamiliar knots and baiting methods, and pesters elders with 'why'
#       questions about tides, winds, and spirits.
#     timing: Later childhood into adolescence (ages 7-16)
#     trait: Very high Openness (97th percentile)
#   - consequence: Creates friction with stepfather/older men; occasionally costs the
#       household time or small amounts of gear, and makes him less 'marriageable' despite
#       being physically able.
#     scene: He forgets to re-tie a line properly, leaves tools out after mending, and
#       needs repeated prompting to finish dull chores like scraping fish or patching
#       nets thoroughly.
#     timing: Most visible once tasks become his responsibility (ages 10-16)
#     trait: Very low Conscientiousness (17th percentile)
#   - consequence: Earns goodwill and occasional protection, but also makes him an easy
#       target for small exploitations (extra chores, being blamed when gear goes missing).
#     scene: He yields in disputes, offers to share roasted shellfish or help carry
#       loads for neighbors, and tries to smooth tensions in the blended household rather
#       than challenge authority.

#   at hearth/grave, family petitions)

# - event: While he was helping dry and store a small catch and some net weights near
#     the shore, someone took several dried fish and a stone net-sinker from the family’s
#     bundle while the household was distracted.
#   reasoning: Small-scale theft of food, tools, or catches is common in low-surplus
#     communities, and a poor household has limited ability to guard property, though
#     there is also simply less to steal.

Aramu was born in a small settlement on the Bohai coast where people spoke a Koreanic tongue and kept their dead close through household offerings. Power in the wider region belonged to chiefs who negotiated with stronger polities to the southwest linked to the Shang world; messengers came for fish, labor, and young men. Aramu’s family sat low in that order. His father was gone before his birth. His mother, Nari, ran the hearth and the work.

Nari had already buried a newborn son and then a daughter who lived one year. When Aramu was small she kept a shallow bowl near the hearth for scraps of millet cake and a little drink, set out with short petitions to the family dead. She named the dead when she offered—a brother, a sister, her own mother—and asked them to watch over the living. She brought Aramu when she went to the edge of the settlement where the graves lay in thin soil above the damp ground. He learned the gestures before he learned words for them.

Aramu grew with little slack in the household. Nari planted dry fields with help borrowed from her brother Morani and other kin. The sea filled the gaps. By six Aramu carried reeds and brush for fuel and learned to keep his hands away from fish spines when he sorted the catch. He liked the shore best after the first light, when gulls and dogs fought over scraps and the older men argued over knots. He stood too close, asked questions, and then tried to copy what he heard. If an elder showed him a way to twist fiber into a stronger cord, he repeated it for days, even when Nari wanted him inside grinding grain.

When Aramu was seven, Morani took him to a tidal flat to gather shellfish. Aramu forgot the basket once and came back empty-handed, then ran back to fetch it with a grin that didn’t help. Nari slapped his shoulder and sent him to cut reeds as punishment. He did it, but halfway through he wandered to watch someone shape a barbed point from bone. He returned late with a small bundle and a head full of questions.

By eight, men tied to a local headman began appearing more often. One of them, Hanuri, came with a stick marked in notches and demanded contributions: dried fish, bundles of cord, and days of hauling. Nari argued once, short and controlled, then paid. After that she kept a small store hidden under packed earth, and she sent Aramu to keep quiet when strangers were near.

A younger sister was born when Aramu was two; she died the same day. A younger brother followed when Aramu was four and also died as a newborn. After that Morani pushed Nari toward remarriage. When Aramu turned ten, Nari married Kanu, a man from a nearby household with his own kin and obligations. Aramu slept in a different corner and ate from a different pot, but he stayed with his mother. Kanu expected fast hands and finished tasks. He corrected Aramu more than once for leaving a net needle out in the sand or failing to rinse salt from a line. Aramu apologized quickly and tried to make it right, offering to take extra trips to the water or carry heavier loads, but he repeated the same mistakes.

A last sister, Sori, lived. Aramu carried her on his hip when Nari needed both hands free. He found ways to entertain her—shells that rattled in a small gourd, a crab tied to a reed—until Kanu told him to stop wasting time and watch the tide. With other youths he laughed easily, especially with Guri, a boy who teased him for staring at every unfamiliar tool. Aramu teased back, then offered a share of roasted shellfish to end it.

Winters after his twelfth year were hard. Wind drove sand against the huts. Ice formed along the shallow water and made launching boats slow and dangerous. Storms kept them ashore and forced them to eat through stores early. Kanu counted dried fish by bundles and blamed waste on whoever had handled them last, which often meant Aramu.

In the late autumn when Aramu was fifteen, the household tried to build extra stores ahead of the cold. Aramu helped lay strips of fish on racks and stacked stones used as net sinkers beside a bundle of cord. A neighbor called for help with a boat dragged too high on the strand. Aramu turned away to grab the bow line. When he returned, several dried fish were gone and one stone sinker was missing from the pile. Kanu searched nearby footprints, then accused Aramu of letting it happen. Aramu swallowed his protest and spent the next day walking the settlement, asking quietly, offering to trade a small portion of their next catch for the return. No one admitted anything.

At sixteen, near the end of the cold season, sickness moved through the settlement. Aramu still went down to the shore, but he complained of headache and chills and stopped eating. Nari kept him by the hearth and fed him thin gruel. His skin stayed hot, and he began to cough. On the sixth day of the illness he became confused, tried to stand, fell against the packed earth wall, and lay still afterward. Nari and Kanu washed him, set out millet cake and drink for his spirit, and carried him out to the burial ground where his brothers and sisters lay.
