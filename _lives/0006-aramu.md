#   - age: 15
#     connection: Occurs during a late-autumn fishing run when the household is trying

#       status (loss is felt sharply).
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-4
#     key_events:
#     - Born into a poor mother-headed household; father already absent/deceased, household
#       relies on maternal kin and neighbors.
#     - Household ancestor offerings and seasonal petitions are a stable routine (food/drink
#       set out at hearth; small offerings at graves).
#     - Repeated infant loss in the family (younger sister and younger brother later)
#       creates a background of anxiety around sickness and cold.
#     phase: Infancy and very early childhood
#   - age_range: 5-9
#     key_events:
#     - 'Begins helping with coastal subsistence: collecting kindling, carrying water,
#       helping mend lines/nets, sorting small fish/shellfish.'
#     - 'Frontier pressures become more visible: visits from local headmen’s messengers
#       or demands for labor/food contributions.'
#     - Mother seeks more stable support; courtship/remarriage negotiations begin or
#       intensify with a man from a nearby household.
#     phase: Later childhood (learning work and the shore)
#   - age_range: 10-13
#     key_events:
#     - Mother remarries; Aramu now lives in a stepfather-present household with blended
#       obligations and potential step-siblings/extra mouths.
#     - 'Winters are harsher in memory: storms and icing reduce fishing days; fuel and
#       stored grain become tight.'
#     - Aramu is trusted with more independent tasks (checking lines, helping beach
#       boats), while still not forming his own household.
#     phase: Early adolescence (stepfather household, heavier labor)
#   - age_range: 14-16
#     key_events:
#     - 'Primary work is seasonal fishing and processing: drying fish, carrying net
#       weights, guarding bundles on the strand.'
#     - Experiences a property crime (theft from the family’s drying/storage bundle),
#       sharpening awareness of scarcity and mistrust between households.
#     - Dies at 16 of an acute febrile infectious illness after a short course (high
#       fever, weakness), during a season when sickness circulates locally.

#       but also gets distracted and wanders, drawing reprimands for not sticking to
#       routine.
#     scene: He lingers at the edge of gatherings to listen to travelers/older fishers,
#       imitates unfamiliar knots and baiting methods, and pesters elders with 'why'
#       questions about tides, winds, and spirits.
#     timing: Later childhood into adolescence (ages 7-16)
#     trait: Very high Openness (97th percentile)
#   - consequence: Creates friction with stepfather/older men; occasionally costs the
#       household time or small amounts of gear, and makes him less 'marriageable' despite
#       being physically able.
#     scene: He forgets to re-tie a line properly, leaves tools out after mending, and
#       needs repeated prompting to finish dull chores like scraping fish or patching
#       nets thoroughly.
#     timing: Most visible once tasks become his responsibility (ages 10-16)
#     trait: Very low Conscientiousness (17th percentile)
#   - consequence: Earns goodwill and occasional protection, but also makes him an easy
#       target for small exploitations (extra chores, being blamed when gear goes missing).
#     scene: He yields in disputes, offers to share roasted shellfish or help carry
#       loads for neighbors, and tries to smooth tensions in the blended household rather
#       than challenge authority.

#   reasoning: Small-scale theft of food, tools, or catches is common in low-surplus
#     communities, and a poor household has limited ability to guard property, though
#     there is also simply less to steal.

Aramu was born on the Bohai coast, in a small settlement of Koreanic-speaking people who lived by millet plots and the sea. The strongest powers lay far to the southwest in the Shang world, and their reach came to this coast through local headmen who demanded food, labor, and obedience when messengers arrived.

His mother, Nari, ran the household alone from the start. Aramu’s father had already died or vanished before Aramu learned to speak. Nari’s first child, a boy, had lived only a short time. A daughter followed and died after her first winter. By the time Aramu was old enough to understand words like “older brother” and “older sister,” those children were names spoken over small offerings at the hearth and at a spot outside the houses where the family placed scraps and drink.

Aramu learned early to keep out of the way when adults argued over food stores. He stayed close to Nari, carrying tinder and small bundles, and he watched how she measured grain and hid the better fish in the back of the storage pit. When he was small he squatted near the cooking place and asked questions that made the older women laugh—why the tide returned, why the wind changed in the same day, why the stones on the strand looked different after storms. When he could walk the shore without falling, he brought back odd shells and pieces of bone and laid them out beside the doorway, sorting them into lines until someone kicked them aside.

More babies came. When Aramu was two, Nari delivered a girl who did not live. Two years later a boy died the same day he was born. After that, Nari listened more closely when her brother Morani spoke about finding a man to join the household. Morani was the one who sometimes put Aramu to work, not harshly but with the impatience of a man counting how much daylight remained. He took the boy to check lines in shallow water and showed him how to twist fiber into a tighter cord. Aramu learned quickly when he cared, then drifted off when the task bored him. Morani would bark at him to stop staring at the water and finish tying.

When Aramu was six, another daughter was born, Sori. She lived. Aramu carried her on his hip while Nari scraped fish, and he learned to quiet her with a strip of dried shellfish or by tapping her heel against his palm. That same year, Hanuri, a messenger for the local headman, started coming more often. He took measures of dried fish, demanded help hauling timber, and called out the names of boys who could run messages. Aramu watched from behind Nari’s shoulder and tried to remember every word Hanuri used, repeating them later as if testing how they sounded.

The winters that followed turned sharper. Ice formed along the edges of the shallows, and storms forced boats higher onto the beach. At ten, Aramu came home with his hair stiff from spray and his fingers split from cold. That year Nari married Kanu, a man with his own kin and obligations. Kanu moved into their life with firm rules about tools and time. He wanted nets hung the same way each evening and weights counted before dawn. Aramu agreed to everything quickly, then forgot half of it. Kanu’s scolding was steady. Aramu kept his voice soft and tried to calm him, offering to redo work, offering to fetch water, offering to mend what he had left undone. It reduced the shouting, but it also meant Aramu took on extra chores when Kanu decided someone needed to pay for mistakes.

By thirteen Aramu spent more hours on the beach than in the fields. He liked the first light on the water and the taste of roasted seaweed with salt. He joked with a boy his age, Guri, while they pulled in lines, each teasing the other about who had caught the smallest fish. Aramu also wandered. If he saw an unfamiliar knot on someone’s gear, he would stop and stare until he could copy it, even when he was supposed to be hauling baskets.

Late in the autumn when he was fifteen, the household worked to build stores for winter. Aramu helped lay fish out to dry and stacked net weights beside a bundle of reeds. A distraction pulled the adults away—an argument over whose turn it was to use a firepit on the strand. When Aramu turned back, several dried fish were gone and one of their stone sinkers had vanished. Kanu demanded to know why he had left the bundle. Aramu admitted he had looked away. He searched the shore with Guri and found nothing but footprints in damp sand that could have belonged to anyone.

The next spring Aramu began to cough. He kept going to the shore, still eager to hear stories from passing crews, still quick to say yes when asked for help. Then a fever took him hard. He lay on a mat while Nari brought water and Kanu muttered about lost days of work. On the sixth day his breathing turned fast and shallow, and he vomited what little he swallowed. He died before sunset, sixteen years old, in the house where his mother had first set out offerings for children she had already buried.
