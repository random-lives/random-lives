#   - age: 15
#     connection: Occurs during a late-autumn fishing run when the household is trying
#       to build winter stores; ties to ongoing winter-risk theme and the family's dependent/poor
#       status (loss is felt sharply).
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-4
#     key_events:
#     - Born into a poor mother-headed household; father already absent/deceased, household
#       relies on maternal kin and neighbors.
#     - Household ancestor offerings and seasonal petitions are a stable routine (food/drink
#       set out at hearth; small offerings at graves).
#     - Repeated infant loss in the family (younger sister and younger brother later)
#       creates a background of anxiety around sickness and cold.
#     phase: Infancy and very early childhood
#   - age_range: 5-9
#     key_events:
#     - 'Begins helping with coastal subsistence: collecting kindling, carrying water,
#       helping mend lines/nets, sorting small fish/shellfish.'
#     - 'Frontier pressures become more visible: visits from local headmen’s messengers
#       or demands for labor/food contributions.'
#     - Mother seeks more stable support; courtship/remarriage negotiations begin or
#       intensify with a man from a nearby household.
#     phase: Later childhood (learning work and the shore)
#   - age_range: 10-13
#     key_events:
#     - Mother remarries; Aramu now lives in a stepfather-present household with blended
#       obligations and potential step-siblings/extra mouths.
#     - 'Winters are harsher in memory: storms and icing reduce fishing days; fuel and
#       stored grain become tight.'
#     - Aramu is trusted with more independent tasks (checking lines, helping beach
#       boats), while still not forming his own household.
#     phase: Early adolescence (stepfather household, heavier labor)
#   - age_range: 14-16
#     key_events:
#     - 'Primary work is seasonal fishing and processing: drying fish, carrying net
#       weights, guarding bundles on the strand.'
#     - Experiences a property crime (theft from the family’s drying/storage bundle),
#       sharpening awareness of scarcity and mistrust between households.
#     - Dies at 16 of an acute febrile infectious illness after a short course (high
#       fever, weakness), during a season when sickness circulates locally.

#       routine.
#     scene: He lingers at the edge of gatherings to listen to travelers/older fishers,
#       imitates unfamiliar knots and baiting methods, and pesters elders with 'why'
#       questions about tides, winds, and spirits.
#     timing: Later childhood into adolescence (ages 7-16)
#     trait: Very high Openness (97th percentile)
#   - consequence: Creates friction with stepfather/older men; occasionally costs the
#       household time or small amounts of gear, and makes him less 'marriageable' despite
#       being physically able.
#     scene: He forgets to re-tie a line properly, leaves tools out after mending, and
#       needs repeated prompting to finish dull chores like scraping fish or patching
#       nets thoroughly.
#     timing: Most visible once tasks become his responsibility (ages 10-16)
#     trait: Very low Conscientiousness (17th percentile)
#   - consequence: Earns goodwill and occasional protection, but also makes him an easy
#       target for small exploitations (extra chores, being blamed when gear goes missing).
#     scene: He yields in disputes, offers to share roasted shellfish or help carry
#       loads for neighbors, and tries to smooth tensions in the blended household rather
#       than challenge authority.

#   at hearth/grave, family petitions)

# - event: While he was helping dry and store a small catch and some net weights near
#     the shore, someone took several dried fish and a stone net-sinker from the family’s
#     bundle while the household was distracted.
#   reasoning: Small-scale theft of food, tools, or catches is common in low-surplus
#     communities, and a poor household has limited ability to guard property, though
#     there is also simply less to steal.

Aramu was born on a low, wind-open stretch of the Bohai coast where people spoke an unwritten Koreanic tongue and organized their lives around kin groups, shoreline work, and the demands of local headmen. Far to the southwest, the Shang courts and their allies drew goods and labor outward through chains of lesser leaders; in Aramu’s village, that pressure arrived as messengers, quotas, and the threat of raids.

His mother, Nari, carried him through a late-harvest season and delivered him after two children had already died. The first had been a boy who lived only hours. The second, a girl, lasted a year and then died after a winter cough turned into days of fever. When Aramu was still small, Nari kept a routine at the hearth. She set out a pinch of grain and a splash of drink in a small dish, spoke the dead children’s names, and asked for steadier weather. She took him with her when she brought food to a grave mound outside the settlement and pressed his small hand to the packed earth so he would learn where he belonged.

Nari ran the household without a husband. She dug and weeded the millet plots, dried fish when the shore offered it, and traded small bundles of dried food for salt and twine. Aramu learned early that adults watched what children carried. At five he was already sent with a basket to collect driftwood and dung for fuel. At seven he went down to the strand with Morani, Nari’s brother, to pick shellfish and rinse sand from them in cold water until his fingers went numb.

He liked listening more than working. When older fishers argued about the best day to set a line, he sat nearby and asked questions until someone flicked him away with the back of a hand. He copied knots from men who had traveled farther along the coast, tying and untying the same cord while other boys chased each other with sticks. He remembered stories and tide talk better than he remembered where he had put tools. Nari’s voice sharpened when she had to ask twice for a scraper or a basket.

By six, he understood that the village answered to people above it. Hanuri, a messenger attached to the local headman, came more than once with a small escort. He called for smoked fish, for dried millet, for a day of hauling poles to a storehouse. Aramu watched the men measure out shares and then argue afterward about who had given too much. He volunteered to carry loads because it got him away from the hearth and the small children. He also dropped things, and he came home without the rope he had been told to keep.

In the years when Aramu was eight and nine, Nari birthed two more children: a girl who died at birth and a boy who died within days. After that, the talk around the hearth shifted. Morani pressed Nari to accept a husband. A remarriage meant someone to pull nets, someone to bargain hard, someone to stand in front when other men pushed.

When Aramu was ten, Kanu moved in. Kanu brought his own kin obligations and his own habits of discipline. Aramu did not fight him. He answered softly and did what he was told for a while, then drifted to whatever caught his attention: a new hook shape, a stranger’s boat, a patch of stones where crabs hid. Kanu used him for tasks that needed strength more than care—dragging a small boat up, hauling water, carrying net weights.

From ten to sixteen, winters bit hard. Ice formed along the shallows. Wind storms drove spray into the huts and tore at thatch. Some weeks the shore gave little. Fuel ran short and Nari counted sticks before dusk. Aramu learned to watch clouds and to judge when the gusts would make it useless to set gear, and he took quiet pride when his guess matched the older men’s. He liked the first hot food after a cold morning: fish broth thickened with millet, eaten fast.

At twelve he started spending time with Guri, another boy his age, quick to joke and quick to sulk. They teased each other while scraping fish and argued over who had seen seals farther out. Aramu laughed easily and gave away bites of roasted shellfish even when his share was small.

In the late autumn when he was fifteen, Aramu helped dry a modest catch on racks above the sand. He stacked stones used as net sinkers and kept the family’s bundle close while Nari went to speak with Kanu near the huts. When he turned back, several dried fish were missing, and one net-sinker was gone from the bundle. He ran down the strand and shouted at two boys, then stopped, unsure which one had done it. Kanu blamed him for leaving the bundle unwatched. Aramu did not argue. That night he ate less and said little.

Near the end of his sixteenth winter, sickness spread through the settlement. Men coughed until they vomited. Children lay dull-eyed by the hearth. Aramu carried water for neighbors and then stopped going out. He developed a high fever and a pounding headache, and his stomach turned against food. On the third day he could not stand without help. Nari kept him near the warmth, wiped him with wet cloths, and fed him thin broth. He died before spring work began.
