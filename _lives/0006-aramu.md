#   - age: 15
#     connection: Occurs during a late-autumn fishing run when the household is trying

#       status (loss is felt sharply).
#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-4
#     key_events:
#     - Born into a poor mother-headed household; father already absent/deceased, household
#       relies on maternal kin and neighbors.
#     - Household ancestor offerings and seasonal petitions are a stable routine (food/drink
#       set out at hearth; small offerings at graves).
#     - Repeated infant loss in the family (younger sister and younger brother later)
#       creates a background of anxiety around sickness and cold.
#     phase: Infancy and very early childhood
#   - age_range: 5-9
#     key_events:
#     - 'Begins helping with coastal subsistence: collecting kindling, carrying water,
#       helping mend lines/nets, sorting small fish/shellfish.'
#     - 'Frontier pressures become more visible: visits from local headmen’s messengers
#       or demands for labor/food contributions.'
#     - Mother seeks more stable support; courtship/remarriage negotiations begin or
#       intensify with a man from a nearby household.
#     phase: Later childhood (learning work and the shore)
#   - age_range: 10-13
#     key_events:
#     - Mother remarries; Aramu now lives in a stepfather-present household with blended
#       obligations and potential step-siblings/extra mouths.
#     - 'Winters are harsher in memory: storms and icing reduce fishing days; fuel and
#       stored grain become tight.'
#     - Aramu is trusted with more independent tasks (checking lines, helping beach
#       boats), while still not forming his own household.
#     phase: Early adolescence (stepfather household, heavier labor)
#   - age_range: 14-16
#     key_events:
#     - 'Primary work is seasonal fishing and processing: drying fish, carrying net
#       weights, guarding bundles on the strand.'
#     - Experiences a property crime (theft from the family’s drying/storage bundle),
#       sharpening awareness of scarcity and mistrust between households.
#     - Dies at 16 of an acute febrile infectious illness after a short course (high
#       fever, weakness), during a season when sickness circulates locally.

#       routine.
#     scene: He lingers at the edge of gatherings to listen to travelers/older fishers,
#       imitates unfamiliar knots and baiting methods, and pesters elders with 'why'
#       questions about tides, winds, and spirits.
#     timing: Later childhood into adolescence (ages 7-16)
#     trait: Very high Openness (97th percentile)
#   - consequence: Creates friction with stepfather/older men; occasionally costs the
#       household time or small amounts of gear, and makes him less 'marriageable' despite
#       being physically able.
#     scene: He forgets to re-tie a line properly, leaves tools out after mending, and
#       needs repeated prompting to finish dull chores like scraping fish or patching
#       nets thoroughly.
#     timing: Most visible once tasks become his responsibility (ages 10-16)
#     trait: Very low Conscientiousness (17th percentile)
#   - consequence: Earns goodwill and occasional protection, but also makes him an easy
#       target for small exploitations (extra chores, being blamed when gear goes missing).
#     scene: He yields in disputes, offers to share roasted shellfish or help carry
#       loads for neighbors, and tries to smooth tensions in the blended household rather
#       than challenge authority.

#   reasoning: Small-scale theft of food, tools, or catches is common in low-surplus
#     communities, and a poor household has limited ability to guard property, though
#     there is also simply less to steal.

Aramu was born on the low coast by the Bohai sea, in a village of fishers and millet growers who spoke a local Koreanic tongue and measured authority by kin ties and the strength of nearby headmen. Far to the southwest, Shang rulers dominated richer lands and drew goods and labor outward through raids, messengers, and alliances; in Aramu’s village those pressures arrived as demands passed along by local leaders. His household kept its dead close. At the hearth his mother, Nari, set out small portions of millet gruel and fish broth for family ancestors, and poured a little drink onto the earth at the edge of the yard when sickness or storms came.

Nari had already buried two children before Aramu could walk. The first had been a boy who did not live past his first day. A daughter followed and made it through one winter, then died while still carried on a hip. Aramu grew up with those absences spoken of plainly when Nari prepared offerings: “your older brother,” “your older sister,” names used in prayer even when no child answered.

His father never stood in the doorway of their house. Nari worked the plots and did the grinding and cooking, took whatever fish came from neighbors, and sent Aramu to gather reeds and fuel. When he was small he trailed her everywhere, watching her hands. He asked questions more than other boys. He wanted to know why the tide left pools full of flounder some mornings and not others, why certain knots held when wet, why driftwood washed up after storms from coasts no one visited. If an older man mentioned a distant place across the water, Aramu kept him talking until someone pulled him away.

By six he carried water and picked shells from the shallows. Morani, Nari’s brother, sometimes took him down to the strand at first light to help pull in a line set the evening before. Morani told stories while they worked and made Aramu laugh by imitating the village headman’s stiff walk. Aramu learned where the mud sucked at ankles and where the sand held firm. He liked the taste of fresh seaweed roasted quickly on a flat stone, and he ate it while it still crackled with salt.

When Aramu was eight, a daughter was born to Nari and died the same day. Two years later a newborn son also died. After that, Morani argued for remarriage more fiercely, and Nari listened. She married Kanu when Aramu was ten. Kanu brought a stronger roof and a larger storage pit, but he also brought his own kin obligations and a sharper voice about wasted effort. Aramu tried to keep peace. He offered to fetch extra water, stepped aside in disputes, and took blame quickly when Kanu was angry. That did not stop Kanu from correcting him. Aramu left a bone needle out in the dirt after mending a net and it snapped under a heel. He tied a line in a hurry and the knot slipped, and Kanu made him sit on the cold ground and re-tie the same knot until his fingers went numb.

The winters after Kanu’s arrival were hard ones. Wind drove sheets of spray over the beach and left ice along the edges of the shallows. Fishing days were lost to storms, and the household lived more on millet and thin broth. At the same time, messengers from the local headman came more often. Hanuri, one of them, demanded baskets of dried fish or a day of labor moving goods inland. Aramu went with Kanu to carry loads more than once, walking behind older men with spears and looking at the unfamiliar tools and ornaments some carried. He asked questions the whole way and earned an elbow to the ribs for it.

Nari’s last child, Sori, survived. Aramu carried her on his back when she was small, letting her pull at his hair while he watched lines or sorted shells. She followed him everywhere once she could walk. He let her, even when it slowed him down.

At fifteen, during the late autumn run when they tried to build stores for winter, Aramu helped lay fish on racks of split reeds and kept the bundle of net weights close. A distraction pulled the household away—Kanu arguing with a neighbor about turns at a drying place, Nari hurrying to keep the peace. When Aramu turned back, several dried fish were gone and one stone net-sinker had vanished from the bundle. He searched the sand and the grass, then went to Guri, a boy his age who worked the same shore, and accused him softly. Guri laughed and called him slow. Aramu went home with less than he had carried down.

In the season after that, sickness spread through the village. Aramu took it after helping haul a catch and rinse gear in cold water. He lay on a mat by the hearth, sweating and then shivering, asking for water and then pushing it away. Nari dabbed his mouth and murmured petitions to the household dead, setting out a small bowl of millet and a strip of fish skin at the hearth edge. After several days he stopped rising to sit and could not stand.

Kanu and Morani carried his body to the burial ground outside the settlement and placed it in a shallow pit with a small pot of food and one net weight, then Nari poured drink onto the packed earth and spoke the family names into the wind.
