#     incident: victim_property_crime
#   life_phases:
#   - age_range: 0-4
#     key_events:
#     - Born into a poor mother-headed household; father already absent/deceased, household
#       relies on maternal kin and neighbors.
#     - Household ancestor offerings and seasonal petitions are a stable routine (food/drink
#       set out at hearth; small offerings at graves).
#     - Repeated infant loss in the family (younger sister and younger brother later)
#       creates a background of anxiety around sickness and cold.
#     phase: Infancy and very early childhood
#   - age_range: 5-9
#     key_events:
#     - 'Begins helping with coastal subsistence: collecting kindling, carrying water,
#       helping mend lines/nets, sorting small fish/shellfish.'
#     - 'Frontier pressures become more visible: visits from local headmen’s messengers
#       or demands for labor/food contributions.'
#     - Mother seeks more stable support; courtship/remarriage negotiations begin or
#       intensify with a man from a nearby household.
#     phase: Later childhood (learning work and the shore)
#   - age_range: 10-13
#     key_events:
#     - Mother remarries; Aramu now lives in a stepfather-present household with blended
#       obligations and potential step-siblings/extra mouths.
#     - 'Winters are harsher in memory: storms and icing reduce fishing days; fuel and
#       stored grain become tight.'
#     - Aramu is trusted with more independent tasks (checking lines, helping beach
#       boats), while still not forming his own household.
#     phase: Early adolescence (stepfather household, heavier labor)
#   - age_range: 14-16
#     key_events:
#     - 'Primary work is seasonal fishing and processing: drying fish, carrying net
#       weights, guarding bundles on the strand.'
#     - Experiences a property crime (theft from the family’s drying/storage bundle),
#       sharpening awareness of scarcity and mistrust between households.
#     - Dies at 16 of an acute febrile infectious illness after a short course (high
#       fever, weakness), during a season when sickness circulates locally.

#       but also gets distracted and wanders, drawing reprimands for not sticking to
#       routine.
#     scene: He lingers at the edge of gatherings to listen to travelers/older fishers,
#       imitates unfamiliar knots and baiting methods, and pesters elders with 'why'
#       questions about tides, winds, and spirits.
#     timing: Later childhood into adolescence (ages 7-16)
#     trait: Very high Openness (97th percentile)
#   - consequence: Creates friction with stepfather/older men; occasionally costs the
#       household time or small amounts of gear, and makes him less 'marriageable' despite
#       being physically able.
#     scene: He forgets to re-tie a line properly, leaves tools out after mending, and
#       needs repeated prompting to finish dull chores like scraping fish or patching
#       nets thoroughly.
#     timing: Most visible once tasks become his responsibility (ages 10-16)
#     trait: Very low Conscientiousness (17th percentile)
#   - consequence: Earns goodwill and occasional protection, but also makes him an easy
#       target for small exploitations (extra chores, being blamed when gear goes missing).
#     scene: He yields in disputes, offers to share roasted shellfish or help carry
#       loads for neighbors, and tries to smooth tensions in the blended household rather
#       than challenge authority.
#     timing: Throughout, especially after stepfather arrives (ages 10-16)
#     trait: High Agreeableness (89th percentile)

#   often seasonal)

#   at hearth/grave, family petitions)

# - event: While he was helping dry and store a small catch and some net weights near
#     the shore, someone took several dried fish and a stone net-sinker from the family’s
#     bundle while the household was distracted.
#   reasoning: Small-scale theft of food, tools, or catches is common in low-surplus
#     communities, and a poor household has limited ability to guard property, though
#     there is also simply less to steal.

Aramu was born in 1437 BC in a small settlement on the Bohai coast, on low ground where salt wind reached the millet plots. His people spoke an unwritten Koreanic tongue and kept their household rites with food and drink set near the hearth and at graves outside the houses. To the southwest, powerful Shang centers pulled at the coast through local headmen: demands for fish, hides, labor days, and sometimes young men to serve.

His mother, Nari, ran the household without a husband in it. The first child, a boy, had died in 1442 BC. A daughter followed in 1440 BC and died in 1439 BC after her first winter. When Aramu arrived in 1437 BC, Nari set a small portion of grain mash for the dead children before she fed the living. She did field work and food processing, hauled water, collected fuel, and traded small bundles of dried fish for millet when stores ran thin.

Aramu learned to move quietly when adults argued over food. He kept close to Nari’s brother, Morani, who came and went with the shore seasons. Morani carried net weights in a leather bag and let Aramu handle them when he was small, warning him not to drop them on his toes. Aramu liked the knot work. He watched Morani’s fingers and then tried new ties on his own, changing patterns and then forgetting which ones held.

In 1434 BC a baby sister was born and died. In 1432 BC a baby brother died the same year. Nari’s household had fewer hands and less standing in disputes. Aramu tried to make himself useful. He collected shellfish from the flats and brought them back with wet sand still clinging. He liked eating them warm, straight from the fire, and he talked more at those meals than at any other time.

By 1431 BC, messengers of the local headman came more often. They counted bundles of dried fish and demanded days of hauling. Aramu listened when older men spoke about raids and retaliation along the coast. He repeated their words to other children, changing details, testing what sounded right. Nari slapped him once for it, hard and quick, and told him to keep his mouth for work.

In 1427 BC Nari married Kanu, a fisherman with a bigger household and stronger ties to the headman’s line. Aramu moved under Kanu’s roof. The house held more people and more rules. Kanu insisted on tools being placed in the same spots and nets being hung the same way each night. Aramu nodded and agreed, then left a bone needle in the dirt, or forgot to rinse salt from a cord. Kanu’s anger came sharp. Aramu answered softly and tried to fix things by doing extra chores without being asked. It did not stop the scolding, but it kept Kanu from striking him.

His youngest sister, Sori, had been born in 1430 BC and lived. By 1426 BC she followed Aramu everywhere, grabbing his belt cord, demanding bites of food. He carried her on his hip while he walked the strand and pointed out crabs and driftwood. When he got annoyed he did not shout; he handed her to an older woman and went to sit near the boats where men repaired planks with wedges.

The winters after 1427 BC cut into the household’s plans. In 1426 BC a hard cold locked the shallows with ice and storm winds ruined drying racks. The next winter did the same. Aramu learned to watch the sky and the line of foam on the water. He also learned to take risks. He went out when Kanu said to wait, drawn by a new trick he had heard from a stranger about setting a line closer to rocks. Sometimes it worked and he returned with fish. Sometimes he returned with nothing but wet clothes and excuses.

In late autumn of 1422 BC, when the household tried to build stores for winter, Aramu helped lay out a small catch on mats near the shore. He stacked a few stone net-sinkers beside the bundle. A shouting match broke out between two men over whose boat had the right to the calmer water. Adults turned toward it. When they turned back, several dried fish were gone and one net weight was missing. Kanu’s face tightened. Aramu searched the sand and the grass line until dark, then walked home with empty hands. Nari fed him anyway. She did not ask questions at the hearth.

In 1420 BC sickness moved through the settlement in the cold season. In early spring, Aramu began to run a high fever and stopped going to the shore. Nari put water to his lips and pressed a cool cloth to his head. Kanu argued once about wasted food and then fell silent. On March 29, 1420 BC, Aramu died on the sleeping platform while the morning fire was being built.
