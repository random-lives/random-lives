Ali was born on June 15, 1676, in a small Arabic-speaking settlement near Kurmuk on the Blue Nile frontier, where the Funj sultanate’s reach came through tax demands, itinerant officials, and the authority of local headmen. His household lived by livestock and a little cultivation, prayed as Sunni Muslims, and kept protective practices close at hand.

His father, Yusuf, spent long days with cattle and goats, moving between grazing and water. His mother, Zaynab, slept in a compound shared with Yusuf's family and worked the edges of small fields with other women, weeding and gathering bundles to carry home. Hawwa, Yusuf’s mother, sat near the shade with the smallest children and directed the cooking and the water jars. Zaynab had already buried two infants: Fatima in 1671, and Hasan in 1674. After Ali’s birth, she tied a small leather hijab to his clothing with Qur’anic writing inside, and she asked Shaykh Idris for recitation over water to wash him when he cried without stopping.

Through the cool months he grew sturdy enough to sit, then crawl across packed earth toward the doorway. He laughed when Hawwa clapped, and grabbed at the goats when Yusuf brought them close. After the first rains of 1677, the river ran higher and the sorghum fields needed weeding. Zaynab left Ali with Hawwa in the compound, but Hawwa had gone to fetch water when Ali pulled himself up against the clay storage jar near the washing place. He tumbled in headfirst and drowned on July 17, 1677.

Hawwa and Zaynab washed his body, Yusuf recited the shahada over him, and the men buried him the same day in a small grave outside the settlement, aligned toward Mecca.

<!--
**Issues found:**
- [Pass 2] Khadija mentioned in narrative plan as helping with childcare but absent from story
- [Pass 7] Paragraph 3 compressed growth and death too abruptly—one sentence crawling, next sentence drowned
- [Pass 14] Supervision gap at time of drowning unclear—who was watching?
- [Pass 14] Transition from crawling milestone to fatal accident felt abrupt

**Changes made:**
- Added brief detail of Ali's personality emerging (laughing at Hawwa's clapping, grabbing at goats)
- Clarified the circumstances of the drowning: Zaynab away at fields, Hawwa gone to fetch water
- Added physical detail of Ali pulling himself up against the jar before falling in
- Did not add Khadija—story works without her and adding another name in a short infant story adds clutter
