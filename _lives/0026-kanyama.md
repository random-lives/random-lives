Kanyama was born in the high grasslands where the mornings stayed cool and the afternoons warmed fast. His homestead sat on a rise above narrow gardens and long stretches of shrub and grass. No king’s messengers came to count people or take grain. Authority was close. Elders settled disputes, lineage heads arranged obligations, and a few ritual specialists carried medicines and knowledge that moved from household to household. Kanyama spoke the local Bantu tongue of the highlands and grew up inside its rules about kin, land, and spirits.

His father, Katende, kept fields and animals together, with goats close to the huts and cattle kept farther out under watch. His mother, Lusambo, worked the gardens, stored grain, and carried water uphill in heavy containers. Kanyama arrived first. Seven more followed. Three brothers and three sisters lived long enough to be carried on hips, shouted at, and taught; four did not. Two sisters died before they could walk. Another sister lived to six and then was taken by a sickness that moved through several households. One brother died at two. When the women gathered to mourn, Lusambo still got up the next morning to grind grain.

Kanyama learned tasks early because there were always younger children clinging to Lusambo. When he was small he carried bundles of firewood that scraped his arms, and he hauled water in a small pot before he was trusted with a larger one. At planting he followed Katende to the fields, stepping over cut brush and watching how the older men pressed seed into the soil with quick, practiced motions. When the rains arrived on time, the work spread out evenly: clearing first, then planting, then weeding, then harvest and storage. When the rains delayed, everyone watched the sky and argued about whether to plant anyway. Lusambo listened to the older women and then made her own decisions about which patch of ground to gamble on.

A diviner-healer named Mulenga came to their homestead more than once. He was called after a child’s sudden fever, after a cow’s strange limp, and after a neighbor accused Katende’s household of sending harm. Mulenga shook and threw small objects onto a hide, then spoke to the elders. He tied a bundle of medicines above the doorway and told Lusambo how to wash a child with bitter leaves. Katende paid with a goat kid one year and with baskets of grain another. Kanyama watched closely and remembered details. He remembered rules.

When Kanyama reached early adolescence, the gardens pushed outward. Some fields were left to rest and new plots were opened farther from the huts. A cousin’s household shifted its sleeping place to be closer to new ground, building fresh walls of poles and grass. Kanyama helped cut posts and carry thatch. He did not like being told twice. If a younger boy dragged his feet, Kanyama shoved him and snapped at him to lift properly. Old men corrected him in public when his tone went too sharp. He did not soften easily.

One year the rains came in broken pieces. The first storms wet the ground and then stopped. Seed sprouted unevenly. Leaves yellowed in patches. Lusambo sent Kanyama to gather wild greens and small fruits from the slopes, and he came back with scratches on his shins and a full bundle. Katende thinned the stored grain earlier than he wanted. The adults took smaller portions so the younger children would eat. Kanyama watched the storage baskets and counted the days until the next meal without being told. He began keeping his own small pile of dried food tucked away, then felt ashamed and gave it to his mother to redistribute. That night he lay awake and listened to the goats shifting.

Not long after, sickness struck the animals. A goat developed a cough and then another. A calf grew thin and stopped following the herd. Men argued over which grazing area had brought it on. Katende and another herder, Kasengo, moved the cattle farther each day, keeping them away from damp hollows where insects gathered. They burned plant matter to smoke the animals. They rubbed mixtures into sores. They lost animals anyway. Milk became scarce. When a neighbor asked about bridewealth for a niece, Katende’s face tightened. Kanyama heard those discussions and understood that animals were not just food.

Kanyama did not marry. He spent most nights in his father’s homestead, sleeping with younger brothers nearby, listening to their breathing and to the small fights that broke out at dawn. His brothers who survived past infancy followed him. The youngest, Makala, watched him the way a dog watches a hunter. Kanyama corrected the boy’s grip on a hoe and slapped his hand when he reached for grain before being told.

During one dry season, while the family slept, someone entered the homestead quietly and took a bundle of dried grain and an iron hoe blade from the storage area. In the morning Katende found the space where the tool had been and shouted until neighbors came. Men searched footprints near the fence line and found nothing certain. Lusambo counted and recounted the remaining stores. Kanyama tracked along the path toward a nearby stream, then toward another cluster of huts, staring at the ground as if the earth would announce a name. When an older man told him to stop accusing people without proof, Kanyama answered sharply. Katende cut him off with a single look.

A wave of fever passed through the area when Kanyama was in his mid-teens. Children cried through the night in more than one homestead. Women walked quickly between compounds carrying leaves, gourds, and pots. Mulenga worked without stopping for days, and another healer came from farther away. Kanyama recovered from his own bout and went back to the fields with a stiff back and a short temper. One of his sisters did not recover. After her burial, he kept working, but he began to sit alone at times behind the huts, staring at the ground, missing meals until Lusambo sent a child to fetch him.

At nineteen he developed a cough that did not end. It started as a throat irritation and turned into something that shook his chest. He still went to the fields, refusing to be left behind, and he forced himself to lift and carry. He grew thinner. His father told him to stay close to home. Lusambo boiled herbs and made him drink bitter liquids. Mulenga returned and performed a cleansing at the doorway, then gave Lusambo medicines to burn and inhale. Kanyama followed instructions exactly for a while, then stopped caring enough to keep the routine. He snapped at Makala for bringing the wrong water and then apologized in the same breath, his voice flat.

By the time the rains returned, he could not walk to the far fields. He stayed on a mat inside the hut during the day and sat outside in the evening when the air cooled, coughing into the dirt. On June 19, 814, he died in his parents’ homestead, with Lusambo and Katende close enough to touch him and younger siblings kept back by an elder.
