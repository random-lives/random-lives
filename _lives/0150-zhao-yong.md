#   timing: age 0–5 (1638–1643)

#     in the Huang-Huai plain'
#   timing: intermittent, age 0–8 (1638–1646)
# - event: 'Elevated epidemic mortality during war/famine conditions: spread of febrile

#     narrative_role: 'Peasant farmer (smallholder/tenant) managing fields and taxes;

#   - death_year: null
#     name: Madam Zhao (née Liu)
#     narrative_role: Runs the household, spinning/weaving and childcare; affectionate

#     name: Zhao Shouye
#     narrative_role: Elder authority in the stem family; enforces ritual propriety

#       and ancestors.
#     role: paternal grandmother
#   incident_placements:
#   - age: 6
#     connection: 'Placed in mid–late 1644 during transition-era insecurity and food

#       cough/fevers.'
#     incident: serious_accident (near well/pond/ditch; half-drowning; weeks of weakness)
#   - age: 7
#     connection: Begins spring 1645 after a hard winter and the household’s mourning
#       for the younger brother; flares with seasonal cold/damp and hunger. Leads to
#       reliance on home remedies, temple vows, and reduced ability to help in fields
#       until terminal fever in Dec 1646.
#     incident: chronic_illness (recurring fever + lingering cough/weakness)
#   other_named_characters:
#   - name: Elder Guo

#     relationship: part-time village tutor / semi-literate man who teaches primers
#   - name: Daoist Chen
#     prominence: 'age 7–8 (1645–1646): appears during chronic illness flare-ups and
#       after grandfather’s death, reinforcing household anxieties about spirits and
#       imbalance.'
#     relationship: ritual specialist called for talismans/incense and to address ‘heat’

#     name: Zhao Yong

#     name: Zhao Shun
#     narrative_role: Younger brother; a focus of household attention and worry. His
#       frailty and death tighten the family’s fear of sickness and sharpen Zhao Yong’s
#       sense that resources and care are scarce.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Adults trust him with errands and tools, increasing exposure to hazards
#       (ditches/wells) and creating friction with siblings who feel judged.
#     scene: He rises early to sweep the courtyard lines straight, counts out handfuls
#       of grain for chickens exactly, and repeats chores until they meet his grandfather’s
#       standard; he keeps a mental tally of who did what work.
#     timing: age 5–8 (1643–1646)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (99th percentile)
#   - consequence: Short-term gains (extra food, adult approval) but quiet resentment
#       from the older brother and sharper scolding from grandmother about shame and
#       ancestors.
#     scene: He hides better millet cakes for himself, blames a missing egg on his younger
#       brother, and strategically reports small misbehavior by others to win praise;
#       he makes vows at the temple but treats them as bargains.
#     timing: age 4–8 (1642–1646)
#     trait: Honesty-Humility (4th percentile)
#   - consequence: Fewer friendships and less informal support from peers; he becomes
#       more dependent on family dynamics and more sensitive to household hierarchy.
#     scene: At temple fairs and market days he stays close to the adults, watches rather
#       than plays, and speaks little; he prefers solitary tasks like sorting beans
#       or mending small items.
#     timing: age 5–8 (1643–1646)
#     trait: Extraversion (13th percentile)
#   - consequence: Brief contact with a village tutor or literate neighbor; adults see
#       promise but illness prevents sustained schooling.
#     scene: He is curious about written notices and yamen talk, asks what characters
#       mean, and imitates ‘official’ phrases he overhears; he’s intrigued by storytellers
#       and temple images even if he doesn’t join the crowd.
#     timing: age 6–8 (1644–1646)
#     trait: Openness (66th percentile)
#   - consequence: Reinforces his perfectionism and reliance on manipulation rather
#       than confident learning; increases tension with father’s expectations.
#     scene: He memorizes routines well but struggles with more abstract lessons; he
#       compensates by copying others’ methods and by careful rule-following to avoid
#       being singled out as slow.
#     timing: age 6–8 (1644–1646)
#     trait: Intelligence (33rd percentile)
# number_of_siblings: '2'
# religion: 'Popular Han practice: household ancestor rites + local temple worship (mix
#   of gods, spirits; festival participation; occasional divination/amulets)'

# - M
# structured_incidents:
# - event: While helping with chores near the village well/pond and irrigation ditches,
#     he slipped from a muddy bank and was pulled out half-drowned, coughing water and
#     too weak to do much for several weeks afterward.
#   reasoning: Rural children faced real risks from falls, farm tools, animals, and
#     especially water hazards, but a weeks-long incapacitating accident was less common
#     than severe infectious illness in this setting and short lifespan.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 6 (mid–late 1644)
#   type: serious_accident
# - event: From about age seven he had recurring bouts of fever with lingering cough
#     and weakness (coming and going with the seasons), leaving him small and easily
#     exhausted and making him miss many days of chores and play.
#   reasoning: Some children developed long-running conditions (recurrent fevers, chronic
#     respiratory problems, parasitic weakness), but many either recovered or died from
#     acute episodes before a clear chronic course emerged.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 7 to 8 (spring 1645 to late 1646, before the final acute fever)

Zhao Yong was born on February 7, 1638, in a farming hamlet on the plains of eastern Henan, where Han families spoke the local Mandarin speech and lived under Ming county offices that pressed hard for grain and labor. His household kept a small ancestor shelf in the main room; on festival days his grandmother set out bowls of millet gruel, a few coins, and incense, and the men bowed toward the tablets of the Zhao forebears. His grandmother was a firm woman who taught the children household rites and practical taboos. When sickness lingered, his mother burned paper and asked Guanyin for help, and she tied a small red-thread charm to a child's jacket.

He grew up in a stem family. His grandfather Zhao Shouye sat on the kang and watched work. Zhao Yong learned to sweep the courtyard until every line pleased the old man, and he counted eggs and bean measures without being told. He spoke little with other children. At the temple fair he stayed close to adults and listened to talk from travelers, then repeated stiff official phrases at home.

His older brother Zhao Chang, born in 1636, pulled him into games and field errands, then cursed when Yong reported small rule-breaking to win praise. Yong also hid the best bits of steamed cake during hunger weeks and blamed missing food on the toddler. The younger brother, Zhao Shun, born in 1641, coughed through winters and died in 1644, three years old. After the mourning, work tightened. Grain was dear, and Elder Guo, the village headman, came around with lists.

Mid–late 1644, Yong helped haul water by the ditches and slipped off a muddy bank. He was dragged out choking, and he lay weak for weeks, kept warm under quilts while his mother and grandmother took turns feeding him thin rice-water and ginger. In 1645 Teacher Qian took him for primer recitation, but Yong's attention broke whenever the lines grew hard. In spring 1645 his cough returned with fevers. His grandfather died that spring, worn down by a hard winter. The cough came again with the first cold winds, leaving Yong tired and short of breath. A Daoist, Chen, pasted talismans by the door and gave ashes to mix in water. His grandmother checked his forehead each morning and scolded him to stay warm.

On December 25, 1646, an acute fever took Zhao Yong. His body was washed, dressed, and laid out on a plank; his family burned paper money and set incense before the ancestors before burial outside the village.
