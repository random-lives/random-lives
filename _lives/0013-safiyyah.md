Safiyyah was born on January 20, 1056, in a small oasis village in Najd, on the plateau west of the great routes that tied the peninsula to Iraq and the Hijaz. The village answered to local lineages and their agreements, and its people spoke the Arabic of central Arabia and prayed as Sunnis.

Her father, Salim, spent most days with goats and sheep on the stony grazing outside the palms, moving with a small group of men and boys to watch for strays and wolves. Her mother, Khawlah, ran the household work. She carried water, kept the hearth, and worked the animals brought close: milking, straining, salting, and storing what could be kept. The house held their first child, Yusuf, born in 1053. At three, he followed his mother to the pen, slapped at flies, and cried when she pushed him back from the horned animals.

On the day Safiyyah was born, Salim returned from the range before sunset and stood by the doorway while Khawlah’s mother recited Qur’an softly. The call to prayer was spoken into the baby’s ear, and Khawlah washed and wrapped her. In the following months Khawlah fed her and kept her close during chores, shifting her to a mat when she knelt to milk.

In early October, Safiyyah’s navel infection turned into a whole-body sickness. Khawlah cleaned and bound it and asked for ruqyah from a neighbor who knew the verses. Safiyyah died on October 16, 1056, before the next dawn prayer.
