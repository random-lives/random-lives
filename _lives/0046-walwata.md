Walwata was born the youngest child in a Luwic-speaking farming household near the wooded ridges above the lakes of northwest Anatolia, where local leaders answered to greater powers to the east and carried tribute along established tracks. Her family followed the old local cults shaped by Hittite influence: Storm-god Tarḫunta and the Sun goddess received bread, beer, and lamb fat at the hearth and at a village shrine.

Her father, Armawi, managed pack animals and agreements for moving grain, wool, and jars of oil between hamlets and larger storehouses. He lived with his wife Anniya in his father’s compound under the authority of Hantiliya, with Suppiya directing much of the women’s work. Walwata’s brothers filled the yard. Tarhuntiya and Runtiya handled animals and loads; Zidanta ran messages. Piyama, eight years old, stayed close to the newborn and had to be pulled away from her sleeping place.

Anniya had already buried three infants—Tarpawi, Maliya, and Kubabi—and kept Walwata close, feeding her often and watching her weight. Suppiya ground barley and mixed thin porridge when Anniya’s milk ran low, and Alliya carried water and warmed cloths by the fire. Walwata failed to gain strength through the winter and spring.

In her first year she died in the compound. Anniya washed her, wrapped her in a linen cloth from the household loom, and Hantiliya poured a small libation of beer at the threshold before they placed her in a shallow grave near the house wall with a pinch of grain and a bead.
