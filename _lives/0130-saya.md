# ethnicity: Local north-coast valley community (Virú/Chao coastal people; Early Horizon/Initial
#   Period tradition)
# father_occupation: 'Mixed subsistence: farmer + part-time fisher/shore collector (or
#   regular participation in coastal expeditions)'
# historical_context:
# - event: Irrigation-system labor mobilizations (corvée-style communal work) for canal
#     cleaning, repairs, and possible expansion, increasing seasonal labor demands and
#     obligations on households
#   timing: recurrent throughout life, especially each dry-season maintenance period
#     (ages 10–45)
# - event: Major El Niño–related flood episodes on the north coast causing destructive
#     river flows, damage to canals/fields, loss of stored food, and forced rebuilding
#     (followed by disease spikes)
#   timing: intermittent; at least one significant episode likely during adulthood (ages
#     15–40)
# - event: Expansion/intensification of long-distance exchange networks (shells, pigments,
#     metals/ores, highland goods) that increased demand for cotton thread, cordage,
#     and textiles as trade goods
#   timing: gradual trend across her lifetime, noticeable from youth into mid-adulthood
#     (ages 10–40)
# - event: Spread or strengthening of pan-regional ceremonial styles and pilgrimage-like
#     participation tied to Early Horizon (often described as Chavín-related influence),

#     death_age: 0
#     death_year: -1045
#     name: Kiri
#     narrative_role: Younger brother who dies at/near birth; reinforces the pattern
#       of infant fragility that shapes how Saya later mothers her own children.
#     sex: M
#   trait_manifestations:
#   - consequence: Sleep disruption, irritability, conflict with spouse/kin, and occasional
#       avoidance of crowded feasts; also drives hypervigilant caregiving for children
#       and elders.
#     scene: During canal-cleaning season she experiences breath-catching panic and
#       stomach cramping when the water schedule shifts; she compulsively re-checks
#       stored food and textiles at night after hearing minor noises in the compound.
#     timing: visible from adolescence (ages 13-15), intensifies after early child deaths
#       (ages 18-22), flares during theft and husband illness (ages 27-35)
#     trait: Neuroticism (95th) / Anxiety-spectrum disorder
#   - consequence: Reputation for being 'scattered'; contributes to marital tension
#       and makes her vulnerable in disputes (e.g., easier to accuse of miscounting
#       or failing obligations).
#     scene: Forgets agreed delivery times for cordage, misplaces tools (spindle whorl,
#       knife), starts multiple tasks and abandons them; relies on children to remind
#       her of obligations and to finish steps she leaves half-done.
#     timing: childhood onward; most socially costly in young-adult household management
#       (ages 17-30)
#     trait: Conscientiousness (0th)
#   - consequence: Slower adaptation to changing exchange aesthetics; relies on a few
#       trusted styles, which keeps her goods dependable but sometimes less prestigious.
#     scene: Resists adopting new weaving patterns/ritual fashion brought by travelers;
#       prefers proven household routines and becomes distressed when neighbors introduce
#       unfamiliar feast customs.
#     timing: adolescence into adulthood (ages 12-35)
#     trait: Openness (5th)
#   - consequence: Less suited to some heavy canal labor; occasional teasing in youth;
#       strengthens identity as an essential producer rather than a labor leader.
#     scene: In work gatherings she is physically overlooked and must push forward to
#       be heard; she is assigned tasks requiring fine handwork rather than heavy carrying,
#       reinforcing her textile specialization.
#     timing: childhood through adulthood (ages 7-45)
#     trait: Very short stature (4th percentile)
#   - consequence: Buffers the household against some shocks; earns grudging respect
#       even from those who find her unreliable day-to-day.
#     scene: Quickly calculates how to reallocate thread/cordage after the theft to
#       still obtain dried fish and maize, negotiating with multiple households despite
#       her social discomfort.
#     timing: young adult to mid-adult (ages 24-35)
#     trait: Intelligence (74th)
# number_of_children: '6'
# number_of_siblings: '4'
# occupation: Textile and cotton work (spinning/weaving; cordage/net-making) as primary
#   specialization alongside household duties
# religion: Household offerings to local land/water powers (sprinkling libations, food
#   offerings, small burning/smoke rituals) + participation in seasonal farming/irrigation
#   ceremonies

# structured_incidents:
# - event: A bundle of her finished cotton textiles/cordage (kept for barter) went missing
#     from the household compound after a crowded work-feast/irrigation-cleaning gathering;
#     she believed someone from a neighboring household took it and denied it, leaving
#     her short on goods meant to trade for dried fish and maize.
#   reasoning: Household goods (textiles, food stores, tools) were theft targets, but
#     rural kin-compound living and strong reciprocity norms reduce opportunistic crime
#     compared with towns; still, raids/petty theft are common human universals. Her
#     role in textile production created portable valuables that could be stolen or
#     cheated in exchange.
#   tier: 1
#   timing: age 27-28
#   type: victim_property_crime
# - event: During an extended chest-fever illness of her husband, she took over most
#     household provisioning and textile work while also nursing him—keeping him warm,
#     preparing thin maize gruel and herbal infusions, and managing water and fuel—until
#     he partially recovered and then relapsed again months later.
#   reasoning: High infectious disease and injury rates make prolonged home care for
#     a spouse, child, or close kin fairly likely in a kin-compound household, especially
#     for an adult woman.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 33-35
#   type: sick_relative
# - event: After her mother became frail with chronic joint pain and weakness, she periodically
#     hosted her in her own dwelling within the kin compound and provided daily help—food
#     preparation, washing, spinning work she could still do seated, and accompaniment
#     to seasonal water/field rites—while coordinating support with siblings across
#     valleys.
#   reasoning: One sibling lived to old age and parents could survive into later life,
#     but she migrated to a neighboring valley, which reduces (not eliminates) the chance
#     she was the primary hands-on caregiver for her own parents; in-law elder care
#     remains possible.
#   tier: 2
#   timing: age 39-44

Saya was born into a small farming and fishing household in the lower valley near the dry coast, where families depended on irrigation canals and on the exchange of coastal goods. Her people spoke a local north-coast tongue no one wrote down. Authority sat in family compounds and work leaders who organized canal labor and feasts; households brought offerings to the forces in the water and the soil and kept obligations to the dead close. Her parents, Maki and Chani, lived in a compound with other relatives, their rooms and work spaces clustered behind low walls to keep out windblown sand.

She was the third child. Her oldest brother, Tani, was already a boy who followed their father to fields and to the shore. A sister, Mira, had died in infancy; her name was still used when adults spoke sharply over a crying baby. Two years after Saya’s birth, her mother bore Nala, and then Kiri, a boy who died as an infant when Saya was four. Saya grew up hearing quiet counts of days and nights after a baby’s last breath, and watching how her mother measured grain more carefully afterward.

Ona, Saya’s maternal grandmother, lived close enough to be in and out of their doorway each day. Ona taught her the small acts that framed the mornings: a pinch of meal, a splash of chicha on the packed earth, a few words said low toward the canal before anyone stepped into the fields. When Saya was five, Ona let her hold a small gourd cup and pour the libation herself. Saya’s hands were steady for that. She was short even as a child, and people sometimes stepped around her without noticing; Ona made a point of calling her forward.

Chani worked cotton almost every day. She rolled the soft fiber on her thigh, spun thread, and twisted cordage for nets and lashings. Saya learned by sitting near her mother and copying, pulling too hard and snapping thread, then starting again. She did it well when she kept at it, but she would wander off mid-task, leaving a spindle whorl somewhere under a mat or in the dust near the cooking place. Chani scolded her for it, then tied the whorl to a cord so it would not vanish again.

The dry-season canal cleaning began before Saya could carry much. Work leader Kantu called households by family group, and children hauled smaller baskets of silt and reeds. Saya forgot her basket more than once and arrived with empty hands, cheeks hot, eyes darting. Kantu’s voice carried. Tani would shove a spare into her arms and tell her to stop looking like a rabbit. She kept working, but her stomach clenched at shouted names, and she sometimes ran to the edge of the compound afterward to sit where the wind came through and count her breaths.

Ona died when Saya was thirteen. The day her grandmother’s body was carried out, Saya sat against the wall by the storage jars and could not swallow. After that, she began waking with a tight chest and a sour taste in her mouth, and she checked the door-lash again and again at night, listening for footsteps. Chani told her to chew a certain leaf from the irrigated plots and drink warm water, but Saya kept rubbing her palms on her skirt, restless even when she sat still.

By her mid-teens, strangers came through more often: men with bright shells, red pigment, and stones from inland; women from other valleys who looked at cloth and cordage with practiced eyes. Saya watched them, learning what they valued, then returned to the same patterns her mother taught her. When someone tried to show her a new motif, she frowned and said it wasted thread.

At seventeen, she married Puma, a man from a neighboring valley. The marriage meant leaving her natal compound. Tani walked with her partway, carrying a bundle of household goods, then turned back without many words. In Puma’s compound, people spoke her language with a different cadence. She felt watched, and when her anxiety rose she avoided the busiest courtyard, working instead near a doorway where she could see who approached.

Her first child, Ami, arrived when Saya was eighteen. She held the girl tightly, counting the child's breaths. Ami survived to three, then died after a short sickness that began with loose stools and a weak cry. Saya washed the child's body with warm water and ash. The next pregnancy ended with Kaya, a daughter who did not live past the first day. Two years later, a son, Rumi, died soon after birth. Saya's sleep broke into short scraps, and she snapped at Puma when he came in from the fields with mud on his legs.

When Saya was twenty-six, word came from the natal valley that Nala had died at twenty-four. A visiting relative carried the news. Saya asked the same questions again and again, but the answers did not change.

She worked constantly anyway. Cotton thread ran through her days. She spun while watching the cooking fire, twisted cord while her older surviving daughter, Sima, played in the dirt, and knotted cords for nets while Kuna, her surviving son, learned to walk. She liked the feel of finished cordage wound into neat coils. It was one of the few things in her life that came out exactly as she wanted. She also liked early morning before other households stirred, when she could step outside with a small cup of chicha and pour a mouthful onto the ground by the canal, speaking to the water and to her dead children in the same breath.

When Saya was twenty-seven, she prepared a bundle of cordage and cloth for barter. After a canal-cleaning gathering with feasting—maize beer, roasted fish brought from the shore, and piles of cooked beans—her bundle went missing from where she had tucked it behind a mat. The courtyard had been crowded, people laughing and pushing past each other. She confronted Yara, a neighbor who had handled the cloth earlier and admired the tight twist of the cords. Yara denied it with a flat voice. Saya's hands shook as she spoke, and she lost her place, repeating herself and then falling silent, staring at Yara's mouth. The loss left her short on goods meant to trade for dried fish and maize. For weeks she counted and recounted what remained, and she began tying bundles to roof beams with extra knots, then checking the knots again at night.

Her father Maki died when Saya was thirty-one, after a short fever. News came through Tani. Saya could not go back for the burial—the journey was too long for the days allowed—and she poured chicha on the ground in the early morning, speaking his name toward the water.

A large flood hit when she was thirty-two. River water tore at the canal banks and filled fields with silt and debris. Households worked for days under Kantu’s direction, cutting channels and shoring up the weakened edges. Afterward came coughing and fever through the compound. Puma began to cough that season. At first it was a rough chest-fever that eased after a few weeks. Achi, an elder healer, brought herbal infusions and told Saya to keep him warm and to offer chicha and meal at the canal’s edge at dawn. Saya did it with strict care, then panicked when Puma coughed blood into a cloth.

When she was thirty-four, Puma’s illness returned and stayed. Saya took over most provisioning, kept her textile work going, and nursed him through nights when his breathing rattled. She fed him thin maize gruel and held a gourd of water to his lips. She forgot other obligations—missed a meeting about labor assignments, lost track of a neighbor’s borrowed tool—and people complained. Puma, hot and exhausted, shouted at her for leaving the fire untended. She shouted back. Sima, then a young woman, stepped between them and took over tasks without asking. Kuna carried water and firewood and began joining older boys on coastal collecting trips.

After Puma's illness began, Saya bore Lina, her last child, at thirty-four. Lina lived to six and died in a season of widespread diarrhea when Saya was forty. Saya washed the girl and wrapped her in cloth she had woven herself.

Puma died when Saya was thirty-five. After his burial, Saya’s household became female-headed within the compound, anchored by Sima and Kuna. Saya still produced cordage and cloth, but she relied on her older children to keep track of who owed what and when communal work began. She could plan exchanges quickly in her head, but she misplaced small things constantly and then accused others, voice sharp, until Sima found the item under a mat or near the jars.

At forty-one, her mother Chani grew stiff with joint pain and weakness. Chani now moved between relatives. Saya hosted her mother in her own dwelling for stretches, washing her, cooking soft food, and setting Chani up with cotton to twist while seated. Saya coordinated with Tani across valleys through visiting relatives, arguing over who would provide maize and who would send fish. Chani still scolded her for leaving spindles on the floor, and still smoothed her hair when they sat together in the evening. Saya hovered, checking whether her mother had eaten, whether her blanket was pulled up, whether her breathing sounded wrong.

Chani died the following year.

By then, Sima had a partner, Rina, a young woman who helped with canal labor and carried goods for exchange. The household had steadied into a working arrangement: Sima and Rina handled obligations outside the compound, Kuna did heavy work and coastal trips, and Saya kept spinning thread and cordage, checking and rechecking her bundles.

Saya died at forty-five after an acute illness that began with fever and weakness and ended quickly. Her household washed her body, wrapped her in textiles from her own work, and placed small offerings of food and chicha with her before burial near the settlement's resting ground, with Sima and Kuna speaking the household words to the water and the earth.
