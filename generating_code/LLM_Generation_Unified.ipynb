      "Zhang Wei was born on October 21, 1995, in a village area of Gouchang in Zhijin County, Bijie, in the mountainous karst of western Guizhou. The county sat firmly inside the People’s Republic of China, governed through township and county offices, and the family lived in the everyday Han world of Southwestern Mandarin, state schools, and seasonal rites at graves and household altars rather than regular temple attendance.\n",
      "\n",
      "His father, Zhang Guoshun, farmed small plots and kept a few animals when feed allowed. His mother, Luo Meilan, ran the household and worked the fields when planting and harvesting came. The house held a third adult too: his paternal grandmother, Zhang Shuhua. She slept close to the kitchen warmth in winter, kept the money in a cloth pouch, and watched the children when the parents were in the fields. Wei arrived after two girls. Zhang Li, born in 1989, already handled chores with a seriousness that made her seem older than she was. Zhang Fang, born in 1992, watched Wei with quick attention and laughed at him when he tried to keep up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The family was poor enough that every purchase carried a small argument. Soap, cooking oil, a new pair of shoes for school—Meilan counted and recounted. Guoshun’s temper rose fastest when someone broke a tool or wasted grain. Still, the house had routines. Before Spring Festival, Shuhua supervised the cleaning, then taped fresh red paper couplets at the door. On Qingming, they carried paper money, incense, and a small bottle of baijiu to the graves. Wei learned to bow, set the incense upright, and wait while adults spoke quietly to ancestors by name.\n",
      "\n",
      "He started primary school with a slate of cheap notebooks and a pencil cut short from use. His teachers drilled characters and basic arithmetic. He talked more than he studied. At home, he chased his sisters into laughter, then got scolded for making noise when Shuhua wanted quiet. In summer he liked cold noodles with vinegar from a roadside stall after school; in winter he hovered near the stove and peeled sweet potatoes, stealing bites before they cooled.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he was twelve, winter weather came hard. In early 2008 freezing rain turned paths slick and coated branches and wires. The village spent days with unreliable power and slow travel to the town market. Guoshun worried aloud about food prices and the condition of the animals. Wei, home from school, carried water carefully and learned how quickly a small hardship could spread across the household.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following year brought a change that cut deeper. In 2009 Shuhua’s health failed after months of coughing and weakness. She still insisted on sitting upright to supervise meals, then began to stay in bed. Wei hovered around her more than he admitted, asking if she wanted tea, then leaving the cup untouched when she waved him away. She died that year. Afterward Meilan’s days stretched longer, and Wei’s sisters stepped in without being asked. Wei became more irritable when corrected and more clingy when he felt the house turning quiet. He began to take small worries into the night—money, school, whether his father would get angry—then covered it the next day by being louder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between 2009 and 2011 the area went through repeated dry stretches that made water management a regular topic at home. Wei carried buckets and watched his father argue with neighbors about whose turn it was at a shared source. School mattered less than cash. His marks stayed middling, and when teachers pushed him toward more study he joked his way out and promised he would try tomorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "By 2010 he had started middle school, taller than many classmates and quick to find friends. He sat with boys who traded cheap cigarettes and stories about jobs in cities. In 2011 he joined older youths at night markets when they visited town, buying skewers and sweet drinks with coins they should have saved. He liked being the one who ordered, who called out to stall owners, who made others laugh by repeating their accents.\n",
      "\n",
      "At fifteen he began talking about leaving. Roads improved, buses ran more reliably, and people returned from Guangdong and other provinces with smartphones and new jackets. His father complained about foolish spending, then asked those same returnees for contact numbers. In 2013, after leaving school, Wei took short jobs near home—moving materials, helping a mason, loading sacks—and then followed introductions to city work. He learned the rhythm of labor hiring: early mornings, men crowding around a foreman, bargaining fast, taking whatever came.\n",
      "\n",
      "A labor broker everyone called Qian Laoban pulled him into a crew and taught him what mattered on site: keep your helmet on when supervisors appear, carry more than you talk when the concrete arrives, and don’t count on wages coming exactly on time. Wei listened when the talk was practical. When it came to saving money, he drifted. A good pay month meant he bought better meals for the room, treated coworkers to beer, and sent a remittance home late with a cheerful excuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "He rented shared rooms near worksites and slept on narrow beds with his clothes folded at his feet. He made friends easily. One was He Ming, a fellow villager who became his closest companion in the city. They ate late-night bowls of noodles, played cards, and joked about foremen behind their backs. When Wei felt cornered by worry, he walked outside to a convenience store, bought sunflower seeds, and chewed them while watching traffic.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2016, at twenty-one, he met Li Jing through coworkers and nearby rentals. She worked in the city and had her own small circle of friends. Wei talked too much on their first few meetings and still got her number. They dated fast, meeting after shifts for spicy hotpot or rice noodles, then sitting outside on plastic stools and watching people pass. They had sex that year, private and practical, in rented rooms with thin walls and a shared bathroom down the hall. He told He Ming about it in a bragging tone, then stopped when he saw how quickly stories traveled.\n",
      "\n",
      "The relationship ran on energy and then wore down. Wei changed sites. Li Jing wanted clearer plans. He forgot promises, arrived late, spent money on nights out and apologized afterward. In 2018 she ended it. He took it badly for a week, calling too often, then pretending it didn’t matter. He sent more money home for a while as if that proved something.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2019 he began a serious long-distance relationship with Chen Xia, a woman from near his home county he connected with through hometown networks and WeChat. Her family asked about marriage early. His own parents asked too, especially with his sisters aging into their own households. Wei answered with jokes, then with irritation when pressed. He liked Chen Xia’s attention and the sense that someone waited for him, but he avoided the hard steps: formal visits, bride price negotiations, the question of where to live.\n",
      "\n",
      "COVID-19 changed his working life in 2020. Travel restrictions and testing rules cut routes, sites paused, and hiring became uneven. He spent long evenings in cramped rooms scrolling his phone, then going downstairs to smoke with other men who were also stuck. He called Chen Xia more often and argued more. She complained about his lack of direction. He complained about her demands.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2021, during that strained period, he slept with another woman, Liu Yan, whom he met through the social strip near a worksite—small restaurants, loud rooms, people drinking after shifts. He kept it quiet. He watched his phone for messages afterward, feared gossip, and acted extra attentive to Chen Xia in calls. The secrecy made him jumpy. He lashed out at He Ming for a minor joke and later bought him a pack of cigarettes to smooth it over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chen Xia ended the relationship in 2022. Wei did not fight for it. He told his mother it “didn’t work out” and changed the topic. As restrictions eased, work steadied again. By 2023 he had a regular place in a crew, still doing general labor—carrying materials, clearing debris, helping skilled workers—without moving into a trade. He liked the days when tasks were simple and the crew joked through the heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2024 and 2025 he returned home for Spring Festival visits, bringing gifts and cash, sitting with his father at the table while his sisters, Zhang Li and Zhang Fang, talked about their children and household expenses. He listened, teased them, and then went quiet when his mother asked again about settling down. He left after the holiday each time with a bag of cured meat and pickled vegetables, and a list of small errands from home.\n",
      "\n",
      "By late 2025 he is thirty, living most of the year away from Zhijin in a rented room near construction sites, working days that start before sunrise. He eats breakfast from street stalls, jokes loudly with his crew, and calls home at night when the room feels too still. He keeps a few hundred yuan set aside in his phone wallet, enough to feel secure for a week or two, and sends the rest when his mother asks. He is unmarried, childless, and busy. Tomorrow’s shift is already arranged. Tonight he sits on the edge of the bed, shoes lined up neatly for once, listening to messages in the crew chat and deciding whether to join the others for noodles downstairs. \n",

      "Saraswati was born before dawn on March 12, 1791, in Virapura near Lingasugur, in the dry thorn-scrub country of the Raichur plain. The village answered to Deccan rulers and their revenue men, but her household lived by the seasons and the demands of the village headman. They spoke Kannada at home and used Telugu in the market and with neighbors from the east.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her father, Ranga, worked for wages in other men’s fields and took small duties tied to his service-caste standing when they were demanded. Her mother, Lakshmibai, carried water from the well, ground grain, cooked ragi porridge, and went out for weeding and harvest when labor was hired. They lived in a patrilocal joint compound with Ranga’s parents, Timma and Timmamma. A tulasi plant stood in the courtyard, and Lakshmibai fed it with water each morning. On Ekadashi days she kept a fast and whispered Rama’s name while turning a small strand of beads.\n",
      "\n",
      "When labor started, Timmamma sent for Basavva the dai. The women heated water and laid out clean cloth. The delivery dragged through the night. When Saraswati came, her skin held the dark, wet sheen of birth, but she did not cry. Basavva rubbed her back with oil, cleared her mouth with a finger, and tugged gently at her feet. Timmamma held a small brass lamp near the baby’s face. No breath came.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before sunset, Ranga dug a small pit beyond the houses at the edge of cultivation. They wrapped Saraswati in cloth, placed her in the earth, and set a pinch of rice and a dab of ghee at the spot before smoothing it closed. \n",

      "Deva was born on December 26, 975, in the forested hills east of the coastal plain where the Western Ghats rose into moist deciduous country. Chiefs and kings in the wider region changed names and banners, but in his hamlet the order of life came through headmen and intermediaries who carried demands for grain, labor, and forest goods from the settled edges. Deva’s people spoke a Bhil-related Western Indo-Aryan tongue and kept their own rites: offerings at stones under trees, meals shared with ancestors, and healing work done through herbs, drumming, and trance when sickness returned with the rains.\n",
      "\n",
      "He arrived as the fourth child, after death had already shaped the household. His sister Moti died at three before he could remember her; the story was fixed in the family as a monsoon illness that took her quickly. His brother Balu lived only into 976, small and feverish. Their eldest sister Rupa, born in 971, grew up with the knowledge that she had outlasted the others. When Deva was a toddler she carried him on her hip as she fetched water and firewood, scolding him sharply when he grabbed at her hair, then laughing when he copied her words in his soft child voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The household was an extended one, centered on Deva’s father Khema and his parents, Dhola and Hira. Khema cleared patches at the forest edge and burned them at the right time, working with other men to keep fire from running into the wrong grove. He expected a son to watch, to learn, then to do. Deva watched but did not keep his eyes where Khema wanted them. He followed ants across the ash, pulled apart seed pods, and asked why one tree leaf stayed green longer than another. When Khema sent him to bring a stone adze or a coil of rope, Deva brought the wrong one and tried to talk his way out of it. Hira stepped between them more than once. She had a hard manner but she kept her hand light on Deva’s shoulders and fed him first when there was thin porridge.\n",
      "\n",
      "At five he began to go with the adults to the fields and the streams. Monsoon seasons came heavy. People spoke about fever as if it traveled in the air over low water. When someone in the hamlet shook with chills, Hira set out a small leaf plate with rice, salt, and a splash of liquor at the base of a tree near the edge of the clearing. She named ancestors in a low voice, then the local spirit of the place, and brushed Deva’s forehead with neem leaves. Deva watched every motion and later repeated it behind the house, with pebbles and a torn leaf, arranging and rearranging until Rupa found him and teased him for “feeding stones.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The 980s brought more outsiders along the paths. Men like Kalu, an intermediary with connections to the settled side, came to speak with Dhola and Khema about bamboo, timber, and bundles of leaves. Sometimes they asked for hands to carry loads or to clear a path. Deva kept away from the talk; he sat at the edge of the group and picked at a strip of bark, listening. Dhola noticed this and, when he was in a patient mood, pulled Deva close and pointed out how boundaries worked—where one hamlet’s clearing ended, where another’s began, and which trees were treated as markers. Deva learned quickly when he cared to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dhola died in 989. The funeral brought relatives from nearby hamlets; there was rice beer and meat, and the elders spoke the lineage names over the body. Afterward Khema spoke more and listened less. Deva felt the change. He avoided the loud evening gatherings and took paths into the forest to sit alone on a flat rock above a stream. He liked the clean feeling of early morning, when smoke from cooking fires rose straight and the ground still held night coolness. If he had a small pleasure, it was roasted millet cakes eaten with a smear of salt and crushed chilies, still hot from the hearth. He also liked stories with trickster turns, and he laughed quietly when Rupa described a man from another hamlet who bragged about his hunt and returned with nothing but a scuffed knee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Khema pushed him into heavier work by his mid-teens: cutting, clearing, carrying, guarding burn lines. Deva could plan a route through thick growth and return faster than older boys, and he remembered where certain tubers grew after a fire. He also left tasks half-done. He forgot to mend an edge fence and goats got in. He delayed weeding until the field looked rough, then worked in frantic bursts, sweating and irritated when his hands cramped. Khema shouted at him, and Deva answered back in a quick voice, then fell silent for days, moving through the house with his head lowered and his jaw tight.\n",
      "\n",
      "At nineteen, in the monsoon of 994, Deva’s first serious fevers came. He shook hard enough that Hira and Rupa had to hold him to keep him from sliding off the sleeping mat. After the sweating broke, he stood up thin and unsteady and tried to go out anyway, and Khema stopped him by grabbing his arm. The fevers returned the next rains, and the next. Between episodes he worked, but he tired sooner than other men. He grew wary of streamside tasks and then did them anyway, because the fields needed water and the forest edge needed tending. A healer named Jiva was called more than once. Jiva sang to the drum and used smoke from burning leaves; he marked Deva’s skin with ash and spoke the names of spirits that lived at crossings and water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hira died in 995. Deva had leaned on her sharp comfort more than he admitted. After her death he became faster to anger and faster to fear. He lay awake during heavy rains, listening for the sound of wind and water, counting his breath, then getting up to check the roof lashings even when nothing had shifted.\n",
      "\n",
      "He married Kanta in 996. She came from a nearby hamlet and arrived with a small bundle of household things and a steady way of watching people before she spoke. Khema helped Deva secure a small plot near the forest edge, and the new couple set up a separate hearth. Deva liked the privacy at first. He could sit outside after supper and listen to insects and the distant calls of men crossing a stream. Kanta wanted clear routines—grain stored properly, tools kept in one place, weeds pulled before they went to seed. She confronted him when he drifted. Deva answered with excuses and then with silence. They still worked together, and when his fevers hit, she brewed bitter decoctions and kept the child away from his sweat-soaked bedding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early in the monsoon of 998, after their daughter Lakhya was born, Deva began pushing harder on the boundary of his patch. Another hamlet’s men claimed that his clearing line had crept. Deva argued, uneasy and stubborn, and did not gather allies for the dispute. In the first weeks of rains he walked to the contested edge and was met by a group led by Nathu. They hit him with sticks and fists, driving him down into wet leaf litter. Deva crawled back with bruised ribs and swelling on one cheek. Kanta cleaned him and said little, but her face stayed hard for days. Deva avoided the path near Nathu’s hamlet afterward, taking longer routes through denser growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "He loved Lakhya in short, intense ways. He held her on his forearm and pointed out birds and tracks in damp soil, speaking softly. When she cried at night he sometimes snapped, then took her outside and walked until she quieted. He did not like crowds, but he took her to a small shrine spot under a tree near the clearing, where stones marked the place of offerings. He set down rice and a few flowers, then poured a thin line of liquor onto the ground, naming his grandfather and grandmother and the spirit of the grove.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fevers kept returning each monsoon. They left him thin and easily exhausted, and Kanta began to treat their household as if it might stand without him. In 1001 Rupa died at thirty, and the loss cut away a thread that had held him to childhood. He did not speak much at her rites; he sat apart, rubbing his hands together and staring at the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their son Raghu was born in 1004 and died the same day. Deva and Kanta carried small offerings—grain, salt, and liquor—to the old place under the tree and asked for protection. Deva grew jumpy afterward, quick to imagine signs in minor mishaps: a cracked pot, a sudden gust, a bird call at the wrong time. He tried to work harder, then collapsed into irritability when his strength failed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In July of 1005 the rains were strong. Deva went out to cut and drag a long bamboo pole from a wet slope above a stream, intending to use it for repairs. The ground was slick. His foot slid, and he fell hard against a cut stump and stones. He made it back to the house, bleeding and shaking. Infection followed quickly in the heat and damp. He died on July 24 at twenty-nine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kanta and his kin washed his body and laid it out near the clearing. They placed rice and a small cup of liquor beside him and spoke ancestor names before carrying him to a cremation spot used by the hamlet, where the fire was fed with dry wood brought down from higher ground. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Anandi was born on May 3, 1178, in a farming hamlet in the Awadh/Kosala country of the middle Ganga plain. The land answered to local chiefs and revenue men in the Gahadavala sphere centered on Kannauj and Banaras; village decisions ran through headmen, kin councils, and the men who controlled plough-oxen and seed. Her people spoke a Middle Ganga vernacular, and her household kept its days with ancestor offerings, purity rules, and temple visits when there was grain to spare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her father, Jagan, held a modest plot and ploughed it with a pair of oxen he guarded carefully. Her mother, Sona, ground grain, cooked, and worked in the fields when weeds rose fast after the rains. Before Anandi’s birth, Sona had carried children who did not stay: Gauri, a daughter born in 1168, died in 1173 at five years old; Mahesh was born in 1171 and died the same day. When Anandi was little, those deaths lived in the courtyard in the way Sona watched for coughs and loose stools and in the way she kept a small corner of the house for ritual scraps—rice grains, a wick stub, a pinch of ash.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two children survived long enough for Anandi to share chores with them. Hari, born in 1174, grew into a thin, quick-moving boy who drove cattle and ran messages to the edge of the market. Champa, born in 1176, stayed near Anandi and pulled her along. When they were small, Champa taught her how to keep lentils from spilling through the sieve and how to tuck cow-dung cakes into a neat stack that dried evenly.\n",

      "From the time Anandi could carry a small pot, Sona put her to work. At four, she learned to stand near the grinding stone and keep away dogs while Sona worked the pestle. When Anandi cried from hunger or tiredness, Sona struck her with a thin switch cut from a branch and told her to be quiet. In the hottest months, when the fields demanded long days, Sona left her without food until mid-afternoon; the older children ate first, then the adults. Anandi learned to wait, then to eat quickly when her turn came—watery rice, salt, sometimes a bit of sour curd.\n",
      "\n",
      "She avoided talk. When women gathered at the well, Champa traded gossip and small jokes, but Anandi stayed close to the rope and watched the water in the clay jar. She saved her words for the work that needed them: “Hold,” when the pot tipped; “Move,” when the calf lunged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kesar, Jagan’s mother, came from a nearby hamlet and died in 1190. Before she died, she pinched Anandi’s cheek hard and told her to keep household matters inside the household. After the funeral meal, Sona took Anandi to the family’s small ancestor corner. She lit a lamp with mustard oil, set a little rice and a few sesame seeds on a leaf, and spoke the names of the dead: Gauri, Mahesh. Anandi listened closely and repeated the names to herself as if doing so kept them in place.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1193, Hari died at nineteen after a fever that left him confused and shaking. Without him, Jagan had to hire help at peak times and owed favors he did not like owing. Champa took up more work, and Sona tightened her rules. Two years later, in 1195, Champa died at nineteen. She had been healthy and then suddenly wasn’t; her belly cramped, and she could not keep water. Anandi became the only surviving child. Sona held her by the shoulders the day after the cremation and spoke of marriage without softness.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1194, when Anandi was sixteen, she married Deva, a cultivator from a village within a day’s walk. The marriage brought her into a patrilocal courtyard where Deva’s kin watched her hands and her mouth. She rose before dawn, swept the yard, smeared the floor with wet cow-dung, and set the morning fire. She learned where the grain was stored and who had the key to the pot of ghee. Her own small pleasures were quiet ones: warm millet flatbread eaten beside the stove before others woke, and sitting on the edge of the threshing floor at dusk, rubbing chaff from her palms and letting the evening coolness settle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deva worked the fields and expected obedience. The first time he beat her was in 1194 after she asked to visit her natal village for a day to see her mother. He hit her in the courtyard and then again by the cattle shed when she spoke back. His elder kinsman Biru told her afterward to keep her voice low and not pull trouble into the family. Anandi nodded, brought water, and set about cooking as if nothing had happened. She learned the pattern: a quarrel over grain stores, a comment from an elder, Deva’s hand or a stick, then an insistence that the matter stay inside the courtyard walls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her first child, Kamla, arrived in 1195. Anandi nursed her while grinding grain, shifting the child on her hip as she turned the stone. Kamla learned to toddle near the cattle and follow Anandi to the well. In 1199, Kamla died at four after days of diarrhea. Anandi washed the child, wrapped her, and watched the men carry her to the burning place. That night she placed a small mound of rice on a leaf near the ancestor corner, set a lamp beside it, and spoke the child’s name once in a low voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1197 she bore a daughter, Lila, who died the day she was born. The midwife Sukhdei cleaned the blood from the floor and told Anandi to drink warm water with salt. Anandi did as she was told and returned to work as soon as she could stand.\n",
      "\n",
      "A son, Raghav, was born in 1198 and lived. Anandi’s days filled with carrying him, feeding him, and keeping him from the cooking fire and the tethered ox. Another daughter, Saras, followed in 1200. Anandi did not read or write; she kept accounts by memory and by the feel of stored grain. She refused to short-measure when sharing seed with neighbors, even when Biru hinted that it would do no harm. Once, when a sickle went missing, she found it near the edge of the field and returned it at once rather than letting her household keep it. People asked her to hold small items—beads, a coin, a brass bangle—because she returned what was not hers.\n",
      "\n",
      "More births came. Ganga, born in 1202, died immediately. Champa was born in 1204 and lived; Anandi named her for her dead sister and spoke that sister’s name more often after. In 1206 she gave birth to a daughter she called Gauri, again after the lost child in her natal family, and that baby died the same day. These deaths did not empty the courtyard of noise; there were still cows to milk, dung to pat into cakes, and fields to weed after the monsoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between 1207 and 1209, Raghav grew into a strong youth and took on more plough work, and the household became clearly joint. A young wife came into the courtyard for him, and Anandi found herself managing not only her own children but another woman’s learning and mistakes. She preferred predictable routines. When a wandering healer offered a new herb paste for children’s coughs, she refused it and used the same warmed oil and steam method Sona had used.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1207, a wave of sickness moved through the villages after the rains. In 1208, when Anandi was thirty, Deva fell ill with fever and diarrhea that did not stop. For weeks she boiled water, made thin rice gruel, cleaned soiled bedding, and carried his waste away from the well path. Nanda, an older neighbor woman, helped her fetch extra water and warned her not to let the children drink from shallow puddles. Anandi slept in brief stretches and kept the household’s animals fed and tethered. Deva recovered, but the days left her exhausted and tighter in her movements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mohan, her youngest son, was born in 1208. Jagan, her father, died that same year, and Sona died in 1212. Anandi received the news through messengers and a brief visit allowed by her in-laws. She brought a small offering of rice and sesame back to her husband’s ancestor corner and spoke their names with the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "The beatings from Deva continued into her early thirties and ended only when Biru intervened after a public argument about grain stored for seed. Deva listened to Biru in ways he did not listen to Anandi. After that, Deva’s anger came out in hard words and withheld help rather than blows.\n",
      "\n",
      "In late May of 1215, after a hot week, Anandi developed severe diarrhea. She drank water and vomited it back, then could not keep even thin gruel down. Nanda brought water boiled with salt and a little jaggery, and Sukhdei came and pressed her belly, muttering about heat and impurity. Anandi could not stand without swaying. She died on June 2, 1215, in the courtyard room where she slept with her children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her kin washed her body, wrapped it in cloth, and carried it to the burning place outside the village. After the cremation, Deva’s household set out a simple offering—rice, sesame, and water—for her at the ancestor corner. \n",
      "\n",
      "----\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hanna was born on November 26, 1242, in the hills above Sidon, in a Melkite village that prayed in the Byzantine rite and spoke Arabic in the lanes and fields. The coast belonged to a Crusader lordship, and the countryside lived with tolls, requisitions, and rumors of armies moving between the strongholds and the interior.\n",
      "\n",
      "His father, Butrus, worked stone and wood when there was building to do—repairs to terraces, a new lintel for a doorway, a patched wall for a neighbor—then turned back to the family’s small plot. His mother, Mariam, ran the house: grinding, baking, spinning, tending a few animals, and keeping a corner with an icon and a little lamp that she lit on feast days. Hanna grew up hearing Greek words mixed into prayer and church talk; by adolescence he could hold a conversation with Greek-speaking clerics and travelers on the coastal road, even though he read only slowly and could not write more than a clumsy mark.\n",
      "\n",
      "His oldest sister Maryam, born in 1239, mothered the younger ones almost as much as their mother did. Bulus, born in 1240, died in 1242 before Hanna could remember him. When Matta came in 1246 and died the next year, Mariam hung a small cross above the sleeping place and took Hanna with her to the priest for a blessing, as if a blessing could be carried home like bread. Iskandar lived long enough to chase chickens and pester Hanna for nuts from a pouch; he died in 1251. Salma came late, in 1251, and was gone by 1252. The house filled and emptied quickly. Hanna learned to keep his voice down when his mother’s face turned rigid, and he learned what adults did after a death: wash the body, wrap it, call the priest, and move through prayers without much talking.\n",
      "\n",
      "By eight he ran errands for his father to Sidon’s edge. Butrus liked having a boy who would walk up to any man and start talking. Hanna bargained too loudly, laughed too easily, and kept asking questions of strangers. He enjoyed sitting near the olives at the market while his father checked a stone order, listening to sailors and muleteers argue over tolls and roads. He liked roasted chickpeas and the sharp taste of salted fish when someone could afford it, and he teased other boys by inventing nicknames for their goats.\n",
      "\n",
      "He fought, too. A shove over a turn at the mill turned into a fist to the mouth when Hanna was fifteen, and his mother made him kiss the priest’s hand and apologize after liturgy. He apologized fast and made jokes on the way home, then started another argument with Yusuf, the brother born in 1244, over who had left the gate open. Yusuf had a careful way of counting jars and measuring seed. Hanna mocked it and then depended on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1263 Hanna married Ruqayya from a nearby Melkite village. The marriage began with the usual exchange of visits and negotiations between families, then a church blessing and a meal that ended with Hanna singing too loudly and drawing laughter from young men at the edge of the gathering. Ruqayya learned early that he woke ready to talk and wanted to hear every scrap of news. She also learned that when he was irritated he threw words like stones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their first child, a son, was born in 1264. They named him Butrus, after Hanna’s father. Hanna carried the baby outside to show neighbors and boasted that the boy’s grip would crush an olive pit. In 1267 another son was born and died the same day. Hanna snapped at Ruqayya when she asked him to fetch water, then returned later with a jug and a plate of bread, saying nothing. A daughter, Maryam, arrived in 1269 and lived; she grew into a steady girl who learned her mother’s routines. In 1272 a son was named Hanna and did not survive. Salma was born in 1275 and died before the end of the month.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hanna’s mother kept the lamp burning before the icon of the Virgin on feast days and took the living children to kiss the icon at church. Hanna crossed himself in the mornings and at night and learned short prayers in Greek from Father Georgios, but he prayed in Arabic at home, quick and practical: for rain, for the animals, for a child’s fever to break. He disliked long sermons. He liked the singing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Butrus, his father, died in 1273. Hanna argued with Yusuf over how to divide tools and who would take which obligations. Their sister Maryam came between them, calm and firm, and forced them to settle it in front of witnesses. Hanna took the field work as his main identity and kept a hand in building tasks when someone paid well, but he did not keep careful accounts. Ruqayya kept track of jars, cloth, and seed. She stored grain more neatly than he did and made him look less reckless than he was.\n",
      "\n",
      "A bad run of harvests struck when Hanna was in his late twenties, and the dues felt heavier. In 1271 he began turning animals onto land claimed by a nearby monastery estate when the overseer was elsewhere. He cut firewood from the same slopes, bringing it home in a bundle and telling Ruqayya it was better than buying. When the collector’s agent, Khalil, came through and asked about olive oil, Hanna spoke smoothly and set out a smaller number of jars than the press had yielded. He repeated these tricks each season through 1276, shifting animals at night and sending a boy to watch the road. He told himself it was only taking what a hard year allowed. When Sarkis, the monastery steward, confronted him, Hanna argued until spittle showed at the corner of his mouth, then offered a jar of oil as if it ended the matter. It did not end it, but it kept the dispute from becoming formal.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had friends he chose, not just kin. Nabil, a neighbor cultivator, drank wine with him after market days and played a simple throwing game with stones near the terraces. They laughed at travelers’ accents and at a mule that kicked its own load over. Hanna enjoyed being the man who could get a group talking. He hated waiting in lines for milling and complained loudly about anyone who tried to push ahead, even when he had done it himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maryam, his daughter, became his helper as she grew. She spun and carried water and could quiet the younger children in other houses. In 1287 she died at eighteen after a sudden illness that turned a strong girl into a body that needed washing. Hanna shouted at Father Georgios for not coming sooner, then stood silent through the prayers, jaw clenched, eyes red.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winter sickness hit Hanna hard a few years later. In 1284 a chest illness left him with a cough that did not end when the weather warmed. Each cold season after that he wheezed in the mornings and avoided the steepest terraces. He took on lighter tasks: sorting olives, supervising younger men, arguing over prices. He still went to market, still talked to everyone, still pushed himself to be present.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Mamluk campaigns pressed toward the coast and Sidon fell in 1289, roads became dangerous and villages took in frightened relatives. By 1291, after Acre fell, the coastal world broke apart. Hanna’s household left their home for safer lodging inland, carrying what they could, leaving some jars buried and some animals driven ahead. They stayed crowded in another family’s space, sleeping close, possessions stacked against a wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "His eldest son Butrus fell into a wasting fever in 1291 and never truly recovered. Hanna and Ruqayya spent months feeding him broth and softened bread, washing him, and lifting him when he could not stand. They took him to a monastic site where Father Georgios met them, and they offered oil for the lamp before the icons and asked for prayers. Hanna spoke to the sick boy with a gentleness that surprised even Ruqayya, telling him stories from markets and repeating village jokes to make him smile. Butrus died in 1295 at thirty-one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hanna did not return to steady life after that. He stayed restless, quick to anger, and quick to reconcile. In the spring of 1298, while moving between lodgings and checking on stored goods, he was caught on a road by armed men amid the postwar disorder—bandits or irregular fighters, no one later agreed which. He argued with them as if talk could shift the outcome. One struck him down, and they stripped what he carried.\n",
      "\n",
      "His kin retrieved the body and brought it to the village church. Father Georgios read the prayers, incense rose, and Hanna was wrapped and placed in the ground near other village dead, with the sign of the cross traced over him and a small lamp lit from the household oil. \n",
