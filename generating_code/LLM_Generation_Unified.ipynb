People would have focused activity near reliable water, floodplain resources, and ecotones where hunting and gathering returns were highest.\\nCultural tradition: undifferentiated\\nClimate then: Around 53,654 BC the region was in a glacial-period background climate: cooler overall than today and generally drier, with strong seasonality in rainfall. River flow and wetlands would have fluctuated with shifts in monsoon strength, so landscapes likely alternated between more open steppe-like savanna in drier phases and more wooded savanna during wetter pulses.\\nClimate now: Today the Volta Basin spans savanna to woodland and seasonal dry forests, with a pronounced wet season driven by the West African monsoon and a dry season influenced by Harmattan winds. Much of the basin is heavily shaped by agriculture and major reservoirs, and natural river flow is strongly regulated in places.'},\n",

Adult mortality (especially male mortality from hunting risk, conflict, accidents) plus disease and periodic resource stress makes paternal death during a child’s early years fairly common. Formal “separation” (as distinct from death) also occurs via divorce/partner change, but is usually less frequent than disruption by death. Given this person was the youngest of four and had older sisters with two dying very young, the family likely experienced some early-life stress; however that doesn’t strongly distinguish death vs survival of a parent.
