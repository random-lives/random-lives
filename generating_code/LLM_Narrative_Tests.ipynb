    "STYLE & VOICE:\n",
    "Aim for quiet realism. The main failure mode to avoid: at no level, sentence, paragraph, or structure, should you lay it on thick.\n",
    "- Write in plain, contemporary English\n",
    "- Do not use subheadings, the entire narrative should read as a continuous text\n",
    "- Keep figurative language sparse. Prefer direct, concrete description.\n",
    "- Do not employ archaic inversions or poetic grand flourishes; avoid proverbs unless spoken by a character\n",
    "- Avoid a moralizing ending or cliche last words, aim for realism\n",
    "- Be specific about who did what; avoid vague collectives\n",
    "- Avoid these exact phrases: \"life went on\", \"work continued\", \"people remembered\", \"X was known for being\"\n",
    "- Vary sentence rhythm: Mix short and long sentences. Use fragments occasionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trust the reader, be subtler than you think you can. Avoid cliches aggressively.\n",
    "\n",
    "NARRATOR AUTHORITY:\n",
    "You are omniscient. State facts with confidence. Avoid \"likely,\" \"probably,\" \n",
    "\"perhaps,\" \"may have,\" or \"X or Y\" constructions. Pick specific details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions:\n",
    " - It is fine to report that the character themselves doesn't know something.\n",
    " - If something is historical unknowable and not clearly fictious but could instead be construed as a factual claim, then it is fine to note this\n",
    "\n",
    "HISTORICAL CONTEXT:\n",
    " - Include explicit historical framing throughout where relevant to the story, so that the reader can follow\n",
    " - Assume the reader is intelligent, well-educated and able to google things if interested, but not an expert on the specific period\n",
    "\n",
    "PERSONALITY TRAITS:\n",
    "Personality must be portrayed realistically through actions, particularly for extremes (below 15th or above 85th percentile). Those with low \n",
    "intelligence or conscientiousness should visibly struggle with tasks others manage; those with low agreeableness or honesty-humility should create friction and face social consequences. Do not bowdlerize—negative traits should cause real problems, not be reframed as hidden strengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "EVENT INTEGRATION:\n",
    "Every historical event or contextual detail should do at least one of:\n",
    "1. Reveals character (shows a personality trait or relationship dynamic)\n",
    "2. Builds causally toward the death (creates conditions that lead to or contextualize it)\n",
    "3. Shows social/historical structure in a way that matters to this life\n",
    "If an event does none of these things, remove it entirely. Don't include events as context unless they do clear narrative work. When life events include multiple options, choose one specific version and describe it concretely.\n",

Minor figures who appear once can remain unnamed. Use names appropriate to the time, place, and culture.\n- You do not need to include every piece of demographic information. Select the details that matter for this particular life and let the rest go.\n\nVOICE:\n- Plain contemporary English, no subheadings\n- Omniscient narrator: state facts confidently, no hedging (\"likely\", \"perhaps\", \"may have\")\n- Vary sentence rhythm. Mix lengths. Fragments sometimes.\n\nPROSE STYLE:\n- Write actively and directly. State facts plainly and concretely.\n- Avoid passive, abstract, or distanced descriptions.\n- Include specific details so the reader can see what you mean.\n- No figurative language: no metaphors, similes, or personification.\n- No archaic inversions, poetic flourishes, or proverbs.\n- State what happened. Do not comment on it, interpret it, or frame it poetically.\n- Do not write lines that exist to sound wise or poignant. If a sentence is reaching for literary effect, cut it or replace it with a plain one.\n- Describe what was there, not what wasn't. Avoid defining people or situations by negatives. If a detail only matters as an absence, cut it.\n- Do not introduce or frame events before describing them. Start with the event itself.\n\nHISTORICAL INTEGRATION:\n- Include historical framing throughout so readers can follow\n- Assume an intelligent reader who can look things up but isn't a specialist\n- Early in the narrative, briefly orient the reader to the political and cultural situation: what polity or power structure governed this area, what ethnic/linguistic group the person belonged to, and how that world related to larger historical forces. Keep it short and concrete—a sentence or two, not a paragraph of background.\n\nPERSONALITY:\n- Show traits through action, not summary\n- Do not name personality traits. Show the behavior and let the reader infer the trait.\n- Extremes (below 15th or above 85th percentile) should be visible\n- Don't soften negative traits—low agreeableness causes friction, low conscientiousness causes real failures, low intelligence shows in limited understanding and poor decision-making\n\nAVOID THESE PHRASES:\n\"life went on\", \"work continued\", \"people remembered\", \"was known for\", \"in those days\", \"as was common\", \"like so many\", \"he suffered\", \"it was not X, it was Y\"\n'''\n\n# Age determines length and focus\nAGE_PROMPTS_V2 = {\n    \"infant\": \"\"\"\nLENGTH: 150-300 words\n\nFOCUS:\n- The infant cannot express personality—focus on parents, household, circumstances\n- Can be told entirely from the parents' perspective\n- A few vivid details about the household and the infant's brief life\n\"\"\",\n\n    \"child\": \"\"\"\nLENGTH: 200-400 words\n\nFOCUS:\n- Personality can show in limited, age-appropriate ways (a habit, a preference, how they played)\n- Focus on a few vivid moments rather than a full arc\n- Show the household and family context\n\"\"\",\n\n    \"adolescent\": \"\"\"\nLENGTH: 400-700 words\n\nFOCUS:\n- Show emerging adult roles and relationships\n- Personality should be visible through behavior and choices\n- Include family dynamics and any work or responsibilities\n\"\"\",\n\n    \"adult\": \"\"\"\nLENGTH: 600-1000 words\n\nFOCUS:\n- Mosaic of everyday episodes\n- Include relationships and family changes\n- Show work, community, and how they navigated their world\n\"\"\"\n}\n\n# Alive/dead determines ending only\nALIVE_PROMPT_V2 = \"\"\"\nENDING:\n- End in an ordinary moment, not on a cliffhanger or dramatic note\n- The narrative must end no later than late 2025—do not project events into the future\n- End with a present-tense snapshot of their current life\n\"\"\"\n\nDEAD_PROMPT_V2 = \"\"\"\nENDING:\n- Include the death concretely\n- Do not dwell on aftermath or sentimentalize\n- Avoid: \"breathing slowed\", \"fever rose/burned\", \"eyes closed\", \"slipped away\", \"grew weaker\", \"stopped breathing\"\n\"\"\"\n\n\ndef generate_narrative_v2(person, ctx):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate biographical narrative using the new prompt structure.\n    \n    Age category determines length and focus.\n    Alive/dead determines ending instructions.\n\n    Modifies person in place.\n    \"\"\"\n    age_cat = person.age_category()\n\n    # Build the prompt: base + age-specific + ending\n    full_prompt = BASE_PROMPT + AGE_PROMPTS_V2[age_cat]\n    full_prompt += ALIVE_PROMPT_V2 if person.is_alive() else DEAD_PROMPT_V2\n\n    # Structured incidents and historical context\n    if hasattr(person, 'structured_incidents') and person.structured_incidents:\n        incidents_str = \"\\n\".join(f\"- {e.get('event', '')} ({e.get('timing', 'unknown')})\"\n                                  for e in person.structured_incidents)\n        full_prompt += \"\\n\\nPersonal incidents to incorporate:\\n\" + incidents_str\n\n    if hasattr(person, 'historical_context') and person.historical_context:\n        context_str = \"\\n\".join(f\"- {e.get('event', '')} ({e.get('timing', 'unknown')})\"\n                                for e in person.historical_context)\n        full_prompt += \"\\n\\nHistorical context to incorporate:\\n\" + context_str\n\n    person.messages.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": full_prompt})\n\n    ctx.log(f\"Generating narrative ({age_cat})...\")\n\n    person.narrative = ctx.call(person.messages)\n    person.messages.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": person.narrative})\n\n    ctx.log(f\"  Generated {len(person.narrative.split())} words\")"

Ghaznavid officials collected revenue through local intermediaries and kept roads open for soldiers and caravans. Her family spoke Dari Persian and followed Sunni Islam with the village mosque and its calendar of prayers and feasts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her mother, Gulbadan, delivered her on a thin mat in a room with packed-earth walls. A clay lamp smoked in the corner. Gulbadan’s hands shook from the work of labor and from the cold that still held the house at night in the high valley. Amina cried hard and long. Gulbadan’s older sister, Rabia, cut the cord with a knife used for bread. Rabia washed the baby with warmed water, wiped her with a scrap of cloth, and wrapped her tight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The father of the household was Yusuf, a man who carried tools in a bundle and found work wherever a wall needed raising or a canal needed clearing. People called him Yusuf the builder, not because he owned anything large, but because his hands knew mudbrick and stone. He had been married before. His first wife, Maryam, had died, and her brother had taken their boy, Karim, into his own house. Yusuf’s second marriage to Gulbadan came with obligations and talk that did not stop. Maryam’s kin wanted payments they said were owed. Yusuf’s own mother, Bibi Zohra, kept count of favors and slights with a sharp tongue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amina’s naming happened quickly. On the seventh day Yusuf brought a small measure of grain to the mosque for charity. He came back with the imam, Mullah Nasr, who recited over the infant and told Yusuf to speak the name clearly. Yusuf held the baby, awkward with something so small, and said, “Amina.” Gulbadan repeated it, quiet. Rabia smiled and nodded as if the name settled the child into the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gulbadan’s days were built from short tasks. She rose before dawn, fed the fire, and warmed leftover bread. She milked the household’s two goats, one brown and one white, and poured the milk into a clay pot. She strained it through cloth, set some aside for souring, and churned the rest in a skin bag hung from a peg. She carried Amina in a sling when she went out to gather dung for fuel or cut brush. She washed cloth at the stream when the weather allowed and dried it on stones.\n",
      "\n",
      "The household had more than one adult who gave orders. Bibi Zohra sat near the door with a spindle when her eyes allowed it and watched the yard. She told Gulbadan how much flour to use and how long to boil the pot. If Gulbadan answered too fast, Bibi Zohra snapped back. When Yusuf was away, Bibi Zohra acted as if the house belonged to her alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yusuf worked where the small flow of money could be found. He patched a cracked wall for a neighbor who paid in wheat. He worked on a drainage ditch for a man with more fields who paid in dried apricots and a strip of cloth. Sometimes he joined a group repairing a canal bank, hired by whoever managed the water turns for the valley. The work was heavy. He returned with mud caked in his nails and a rope burn on one hand from pulling stones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some weeks he slept away from home, near a work site. When he stayed out, Rabia came by to check on Gulbadan. Rabia brought news: a cousin in another village had remarried; a man had been robbed on the road toward Kabul; a tax collector had argued with a headman. Gulbadan listened and kept her hands busy.\n",

      "Amina fed at her mother’s breast. When Gulbadan’s milk was slow after a long day, she thinned goat milk with water and dripped it into the baby’s mouth from a cloth. The water came from a shallow channel and from storage jars. It tasted of earth. The family boiled it when fuel allowed, and when it did not they drank it as it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "By mid-summer Amina’s neck strengthened. Gulbadan sat her propped against a folded cloth while she spun wool. The baby tracked movement across the room: the flick of the spindle, a chicken stepping over the threshold, Yusuf’s shadow when he ducked inside. When Yusuf returned in the evenings, he touched Amina’s cheek with a dirty finger until Gulbadan slapped his hand away and told him to wash.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conflicts in the household did not stop because there was a baby. Yusuf’s older son Karim stayed with Maryam’s brother and visited only once that summer. He came with a small bag of dried mulberries and stood stiff in the yard. Bibi Zohra watched him like a judge. Gulbadan offered him water and bread and asked about his cough. Yusuf tried to talk as if the boy lived there, asking him to carry a stone, asking him to fetch a tool. Karim did it without looking at him. After an hour he left with his uncle. Yusuf stared after him until the dust settled.\n",
      "\n",
      "In late summer Gulbadan became pregnant again. She told Rabia first, then Yusuf. Bibi Zohra heard and gave a short nod, as if the house owed her more children. Gulbadan kept working. She milked, churned, and carried brush even when her lower back ached. She kept Amina close and watched her skin for heat and rash.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the first cold nights of autumn, Amina began to pass watery stool. It soaked the cloths. Gulbadan rinsed them again and again in cold water, then dried them by the fire. Amina cried and twisted. Gulbadan fed her more often, holding her with one arm while stirring a pot with the other. Yusuf came back from canal work and argued with Bibi Zohra about money for extra fuel. He wanted wood to boil water and to keep the room warm; Bibi Zohra wanted to save what little they had. The argument ended when Yusuf threw down his tool bundle and walked out into the yard.\n",
      "\n",
      "The diarrhea continued. Amina stopped taking the breast with the same force. Her mouth dried. Gulbadan tried goat milk again, thinner now, and pressed it into the baby’s lips. Rabia brought a pinch of salt and told Gulbadan to mix it in water and drip it slowly, a few drops at a time. Gulbadan did it, counting the drops as if counting could hold the child.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mullah Nasr came once, called by Bibi Zohra. He recited verses and tied a small written charm in cloth to Amina’s swaddling. Gulbadan kept dripping salted water and milk. Yusuf stayed home from work one day and sat near the doorway, sharpening a blade he did not use. He did not speak much. When Bibi Zohra told Gulbadan she had spoiled the child by holding her too much, Gulbadan answered back, fast and sharp, and Rabia stepped between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "On November 23, 1064, Amina died in the room where she had been born. Gulbadan washed the small body with warmed water. Yusuf wrapped her in cloth he had brought as payment from a job, plain and undyed. Before midday he carried her to the burial place outside the village with two men from the mosque. The imam said the prayers. The men filled the grave. Yusuf tamped the soil with the flat of his shovel and went back to the house.\n"

      "Shashikala was born in the hot season of 558 in a small settlement in the wooded uplands west of the coastal plains, where farmers cleared patches and kept cattle on the edges of sal and teak forest. The people around her spoke an Eastern Indo-Aryan village speech and marked their days with household offerings to family deities, alongside fear of the spirits that lived in groves and streams. A local chief’s men came when they needed grain or labor, and the name of the distant king changed without changing the work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her father, Devadatta, owned fields that took a full day to walk across and cattle enough to lend a bull for plowing when a neighbor’s animal went lame. Shashikala grew up in a nuclear household, not in a long row of brothers and uncles around one hearth. Her mother, Nandini, ran the house with hard hands: pounding grain, boiling milk down into ghee, dragging water pots, and calling Shashikala back when she wandered to watch boys chase goats. Shashikala had one younger brother, Harsha. He died at six during a rain-season sickness, sweating and then cold, while the adults argued over which shrine to promise gifts to.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a girl Shashikala learned the work that sat close to the house. She rinsed milk pots with hot water and ash, smeared floors with dung and clay, and carried fodder in armfuls. She could not hold a set of tasks in her mind the way her mother did. She forgot to cover curd pots. She lost a rope and pretended she had never been given it. Nandini slapped her for leaving a calf untied. Shashikala talked her way out of punishments more than once by agreeing quickly and smiling, then doing something else ten minutes later.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she was in her early teens, men with spears came through to demand labor on a road cut and a share of grain for a campaign somewhere beyond the next river. Devadatta went with other men for several days, and Shashikala helped her mother keep the cattle from wandering into planted plots. The demands returned again in later years, sometimes from different agents, sometimes with the same seal pressed into wax or clay, and always with shouting.\n",
      "\n",
      "She married at about sixteen. Her husband, Rudra, was a cultivator from a village a short walk away. She moved to his household and learned their fields and their cows. Rudra’s mother, Sumati, watched her closely. Sumati kept track of everything: the salt jar, the seed grain, the number of dung cakes drying on the wall. Shashikala never matched her pace. She moved fast, talked fast, promised fast, then left things half done.\n",
      "\n",
      "She took to dairy work anyway because it gave her a set of routines that other people could check. Milk at dawn, strain, set curd, churn, boil, skim. She liked the steady presence of cattle better than the sharp voices in the house. In the evenings she sat near the byre, rubbing neem and oil into sores on a cow’s hide, picking ticks, and tying bells with fresh cord.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rudra wanted the stores guarded and the work done in order. By her late twenties their quarrels had settled into a pattern. He accused her of wasting grain, of letting neighbors take too much buttermilk, of leaving the ghee pot uncovered. She answered in a quick flood of words, agreeing and denying in the same breath. One evening he struck her in front of Sumati, and she fell against the wall. Another time, during a fight over how much grain to hold back for seed, he beat her with a stick until her arm and shoulder swelled and the skin split. She took her bedding to a nearby affinal household and stayed there for several days, helping an aunt churn and cook while the older women talked with hard faces about what could and could not be said to a husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rudra died when Shashikala was in her mid-twenties. She did not control the grain or the cattle after his death. Sumati and Rudra’s brother took charge. Shashikala moved between houses for a time, sleeping on mats rolled out in corners, helping where she was told, waiting for negotiations over a new marriage. In that gap she began a clandestine relationship with a man who carried goods between markets, Jayadeva. He met her behind a stand of bamboo near a stream, and he brought small gifts—salt, a strip of red cloth, a lump of jaggery. She became pregnant before a new marriage was settled. The women around her counted months by the swelling of her belly and the changes in her face. Words went back and forth quickly between households to place her under a roof as a wife before the birth.\n",
      "\n",
      "She entered the household of her second husband, Gopala, while her pregnancy showed. The arrangements were tense but finished. Not long after, she bled heavily and cramped for days. The older women laid her on a mat and pressed heated cloths to her belly. They fed her thin rice water, then thicker gruel. Someone brought herbal preparations pounded on a stone, bitter and sharp. The bleeding slowed. The fetus did not survive. She lay weak for weeks, unable to lift a water pot.\n",
      "\n",
      "She later bore two sons who lived into adulthood. The first was Hari, the second was Madhava. She raised them among cows and calves, letting them carry small pails when they were steady on their feet, scolding them for taunting animals, and bargaining with them to fetch water or firewood. She could recognize some marks and numbers scratched by traders and village men; she learned which notches on a stick meant a certain count of pots, but she did not write.\n",
      "\n",
      "In her thirties, after a year of uncertain rains, grain prices rose at the periodic market. People sold goats and even cattle to buy seed and food. Shashikala argued for keeping their best milch cow, and Gopala agreed. That same year, when she was around thirty-four, thieves came at night. They cut the tether and led the cow away from the byre at the edge of the hamlet. In the morning the rope lay in the dust and the stall was empty. Shashikala walked the paths calling and listening for bells, then returned with dirt on her feet and nothing else. For weeks the house had less milk and almost no ghee to trade. Gopala blamed her for sleeping too deeply. She answered sharply, then cried, then went back to grinding grain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rains brought sickness again and again. From her early forties the pattern settled into her body: fevers and chills that arrived with the monsoon, left her sweating and shaking, then returned. Some years she missed work for days at a time, lying under a thin cloth while others handled the churning. When the fever passed she stood up too soon and tried to catch up, leaving tasks half finished and earning more scolding.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Shashikala was near fifty, Hari developed a wasting cough and nightly fevers. His ribs showed. He could not keep down food. Shashikala took over his care. She cooked soft rice and thin lentils, kept a small fire through the damp nights, and sent for remedies: roots and barks, a powder from a traveling healer, offerings made at a shrine. She washed his bedding, then washed it again when he sweated through it. He died at twenty-five. Madhava tried to take on more work after that, but he too died young, at thirty, after another season of fever.\n",
      "\n",
      "By her late fifties Shashikala’s vision clouded. It began with evenings. At dusk she could not tell one cow from another by markings. She held needles close to her face and still failed to thread them. Younger women took over the fine work—mending, sorting grain by sight, checking for parasites on udders. Shashikala still moved among the cattle by touch and habit, feeling for warmth and swelling, listening for changes in breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was widowed again and lived dependently in an affinal household, under the authority of a man who was not her son. She slept near the kitchen area and did what she was assigned: stirring pots, feeding calves, carrying light loads, telling children to stop throwing stones at dogs. Her talk stayed quick and friendly, even when someone snapped at her. She agreed, then forgot, then agreed again.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the rainy season of 627, a respiratory sickness moved through the settlement. People coughed and spat, and the night air filled with harsh breathing. Shashikala took it into her chest. She coughed until her sides hurt, and she could not draw breath without pain. After several days she stopped getting up. She died on August 21, 627, on a mat inside the house where she had been living, while the rains fell outside and the cattle shifted in their stalls.\n"

      "Ptolemaios was born in a small village in the uplands above the roads that ran between the Black Sea coast and the interior. The kings who claimed Anatolia changed in distant capitals, but in his valley the rule came as tax collectors, written orders, and men moving in armed groups. His family spoke the old village tongue at home and Greek outside it, at the shrine, and when dealing with officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "His father, Sokrates, left before dawn for weeks at a time. He hauled timber for an estate steward in older days, then spent seasons burning charcoal in the forested slopes and driving a mule train down toward larger settlements. When Sokrates came back he brought salt, oil in small jars, and sometimes a few bronze coins that he kept in a pouch tied beneath his belt. His mother, Philista, kept the household tight and busy. Grain in storage. Wool washed and combed. A loom that never stood idle long. She took the children into the fields and set them along the furrows to weed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ptolemaios was the third child. Three older sisters filled the house first: Damaris, Timarete, and little Myrto. Myrto died at four, after a cold season when the household bread thinned and Philista stretched it with pulses. Timarete died at eight, too, in a year when sickness passed through neighboring hamlets. Damaris lived into old age. As a child she carried water and watched Ptolemaios when their mother worked. She learned the same prayers and offerings at the local Greek-style temple, and she scolded him when he ran ahead on the path.\n",
      "\n",
      "A younger brother, Menandros, arrived when Ptolemaios was small. Sokrates started calling the boy “my hands for the fields,” but in the first years Menandros was a bundle Philista wore on her back while she spun. In those early seasons Ptolemaios learned to count by kernels and by days. He listened when his father read marks on tall stones near the road—public notices in Greek, names of benefactors and gods. Sokrates could sound out the letters. He had learned on an estate where the steward kept lists.\n",
      "\n",
      "A priest at the temple, Herakleides, noticed that the boy watched every scratch of a stylus. Herakleides set him to copying letters on wax, first slowly, then with speed. Ptolemaios learned to read short notices and receipts, and then longer lines. He learned to write his name without a tremor in the strokes. He could make figures, add and subtract, and set totals in columns. He did not become a clerk in a city. He stayed in the village. But the skill changed how people used him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The local tax demands shifted while he grew. Payments that had been counted in kind started to be translated into coins, and the collectors demanded clear measures and written tallies. Estate managers wanted a man who could read instructions and keep accounts for produce and labor days. Ptolemaios began going with his father to deliver charcoal and wood. He stood beside Sokrates when stewards weighed sacks. He watched how they checked seals and wrote marks on tablets. At home he copied lists for Sokrates: what was owed, what had been paid, which neighbor had borrowed a tool, who had promised a share of lambs.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Galatians arrived deeper into central Anatolia, fear reached the village through travelers and through the silence of caravans that stopped coming. Armed men moved along the larger tracks. People spoke about villages paying for protection and about farms emptied. The estate stewards hardened. They demanded grain early and threatened penalties for delay. Ptolemaios went to market with other men and brought back word of a raid near a crossroads. He did not talk loud about it. He met eyes, nodded, and kept his statements short. He brought the household animals in earlier in the evening. He moved stored grain to a pit and sealed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He married in his twenties. His wife, Eirene, came from a village a half-day away, from a household that kept goats and a patch of barley. The marriage was arranged through kin and settled with gifts of wool and a small payment in coins. Eirene arrived with a trunk of woven cloth and two clay jars. She and Philista did not speak gently to one another at first. Ptolemaios stepped between them without raising his voice. He set tasks. He carried water himself when arguments started. After the first year, Philista treated Eirene as a partner at the loom and in the grain grinding. When Philista died, Eirene ran the household without contest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ptolemaios built his holding slowly. He kept the small plot his father had worked and added strips of land through purchase and exchange. Some years he paid in coin; other years he paid with a share of wool and a kid goat. He kept sheep for wool and a few goats for milk. He stored manure and used it. He rotated where he sowed. When he needed extra hands at harvest, he hired two young men for a week and fed them well. He did not gamble away coin at the drinking stalls. He counted what he had and what he owed, and he refused loans he could not repay.\n",
      "\n",
      "His literacy drew work to him. The estate steward, Antipatros, asked him to witness tallies and to read out a list of obligations to a cluster of villages. Ptolemaios did it with a steady voice and did not insert his own comments. He took payment in grain and a small coin. Some neighbors resented him, thinking he stood too close to the collectors. He answered them directly and avoided insults. When a dispute rose over a boundary stone after a flood changed a small stream’s line, Ptolemaios walked the edge with both men, measured paces, and wrote out an agreement. He had each man press a mark beside his name. The quarrel stopped, not from affection but because the paper trail made later trouble expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "His children were born after several years. First a daughter, Philonoe. Then a son, Sokrates, named for his father. The daughter married into a nearby village and left the household. The son stayed longer, working the fields as a youth. Ptolemaios trained him to read and write Greek letters before he could grow a beard. They practiced on broken potsherds when wax was scarce. He made the boy copy totals and inventories, then checked each line.\n",
      "\n",
      "A disease hit the flocks when Ptolemaios was in his thirties. Sheep coughed and stopped eating. Lambs died. The wool clipped that year was thin. He slaughtered animals early to keep some value. He salted meat and sold hides. He watched for which households were forced to sell land to cover losses, and he bought a narrow strip when the price dropped. He did not brag about it, but he did not refuse the opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Galatian pressure never left. Men spoke of tribute demanded on roads and of villages stripped of grain. Ptolemaios went armed when he traveled with a load. A neighbor’s young man tried to take a portion of his wool bales at a market edge, pushing him and reaching for the knot. Ptolemaios struck the man once with the butt of his staff and shouted for witnesses. He did not chase him. He stood where he was, breathing hard, and demanded the steward record the attempt. The matter ended with a payment and a warning.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his forties an illness passed through the region. It started with stomach cramps and watery stools. People blamed wells, then blamed food sellers, then blamed nothing at all. Ptolemaios kept his household water drawn from a spring up the slope and boiled what they could. Some neighbors died, especially children and elders. He survived that wave, then lost weight through the winter and regained it in spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "He reached fifty-one with a thickened wrist from old work and a back that stiffened in cold mornings. One late autumn he returned from a short trip to an estate center, where he had delivered a written tally and received coin for grain. Two days later he began passing watery stool again. Eirene brought him barley water and thin gruel. He could not keep it down. His mouth dried and cracked. He tried to stand and fell onto the packed-earth floor. By the next day he could not rise. Eirene sent their son for the temple attendant who knew basic remedies, but the man arrived with little beyond herbs and instructions to rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the fourth day Ptolemaios stopped producing urine. His hands and feet turned cold even by the hearth. Eirene held a cup to his lips; he could not swallow. He died in the house on December 29, 249 BC, with the winter air pressing through the doorway and his wife and son close enough to see his face change and know it was finished.\n"
